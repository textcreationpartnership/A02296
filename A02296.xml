            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>POLONIVS THIANEVS</hi> diſputing with the Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of Hiarcas ſayde: that among all the affections of nature, nothynge is more naturall, than the deſire that all haue to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue life. Omitting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſpute of theſe great philoſophers herin, we our ſelfes hereof haue dayly proofe: that to lyue men do tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile: to liue birdes do flye: to liue fiſſhes do ſwime: and to lyue beaſtes do hide themſelfes for feare of death. Finally I ſay there is no liuinge creature ſo brutiſh, that hath not a naturall deſire to liue. If many of the auncient Paynems ſo little wene lyfe, that of their owne frée willes they offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to death, they did it not for that they diſpiſed life, but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought that for their little regarding life, we would more highly eſtéeme their fame. For we ſée men of hawte courages ſéeke rather to winne a longe during fame, than to ſaue a ſhorte laſting life. How lothe men are to dye, is eaſely ſene by the greate paynes they take to liue. For it is a naturall thing to all mortal men, to leaue their liues with ſorow, and take their deathes with feare. Admitte that all do taſte this corporall death, and that generally bothe good and euill do dye: yet is there great difference betwene the death of one, &amp; the death of another. If the good deſire to liue, it is for the greater deſire they haue to do good: but if the euill deſire to lyue, it is for that they woulde abuſe the worlde longer. For the children of vanitie call no tyme good, but that wherein they liue according to their owne deſires. I let ye vnderſtande that are at this preſent, and ye alſo that ſhal come hereafter: that I direct my writing vnto thoſe which embrace vertue, and not vnto ſuch as are borne awaye with vice. God doth not way vs as we are, but as we deſier to be. And let no man ſay I would, and can not be good: for as we haue the audacitie to committe a faulte, ſo (if we liſte) we may enforce our ſelues to worke amendes. Al our vndoing procedeth of this, that we outwardly make a ſhowe of vertue, but inwardlye in the dede we employe our thorough power to vice: which is an abuſe, where with al the world is rorrupted and deceiued. For heauen is not furniſhed but with good dedes, and hell is not repleniſhed but with euill deſires. I graunt that neither man nor beaſte deſireth to dye, but all trauaile to thende they may liue: But I aſke now this queſtion. What doth it auaile a man to deſire his life to be prolonged, if the ſame be wicked, vngodly, and defamed? The man that is high minded, proude, vnconſtante, cruell, diſdeinfull, enuious, ful of hatred, angry, malicious, full of wrath, couetous, a lier, a glutton, a blaſphemer, and in al his doinges diſordred: why wil we ſuffer him in the worlde? The lyfe of a poore man that for nede ſteleth a gowne or any other ſmal trifle, is forth with taken away: why than is he that diſturbeth a whole common wealth left aliue? O would to God,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:4"/>
there were no greater theues in the worlde than thoſe, whiche robbe the temporall goodes of the riche, &amp; that we did not winke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually at them, which take away the good renoume aſwell of the riche as of the poore. But we chaſtice the one, &amp; diſſemble w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the other which is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſene, how the thiefe that ſteleth my neighbours gown is hanged forthwith, but he that robbeth me of my good name, walketh ſtill before my doore. The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the firſte booke of lawes ſayde. We ordayne, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, that he that vſeth not him ſelfe honeſtly, and hath not his houſe wel refour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, his riches well gouerned, his family well inſtructed, &amp; lyueth not in peace with his neighbours, that vnto him be aſſigned tutours which ſhal gouerne him as a foole, and as a vacabonde ſhalbe expulſed from the people, to thintent the common wealth be not through him infected. For there neuer riſeth contention or ſtrife in a common wealthe, but by ſuche menne as are alwayes out of order. Truly the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> had greate reaſon in his ſayinges, for the man that is vitious of his perſon, and doth not trauaile in things touching his houſe, nor kepeth his family in good order, nor liueth quietly in the common wealthe, deſerueth to be baniſhed, and driuen out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Truly we ſée in dyuerſe places madde menne tied and bound faſt, which if they were at libertie would not doe ſuche harme, as thoſe that dayly walke the ſtreates at their owne willes and ſenſualitie. There is not at this daye ſo greate or noble a Lorde, nor Lady ſo delicate, but had rather ſuffer a blowe on the head with a ſtone, than a blot in their good name with an euill tongue. For the wounde of the heade in a moneth or two maye well be healed: but the blemmiſhe of their good name duringe life will neuer be remoued. <hi>Laertius</hi> ſaith in his booke of the lyfe of Philoſophers, that <hi>Diogenes,</hi> beinge aſked of one of his neighboures, what they were that ordeyned the lawes? aunſwered in this wiſe. Thou ſhalt vnderſtande, my friende, that the earneſt whole deſire of our forefathers, and all the intention of the Philoſophers was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructe them in their common wealth, how they ought to ſpeake, how to be occupied, how to eate, how to ſlepe, howe to treate, how to apparaile, how to trauaile, and how to reſt: and in this conſiſteth all the wealth of worldly wiſedome. In déede this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher in his aunſwere touched an excellent pointe, for the lawe was made to no other ende, but to bridell him that liueth without reaſon or lawe. To menne that wil liue in reſte and without trouble in this life, it is requiſite &amp; neceſſarye that they choſe to them ſelues ſom kinde and maner of liuinge, whereby they may mainteyne their houſe in good order, and conforme their liues vnto the ſame. That eſtate ought not to be as the folly of their parſon doth deſire, nor as may be moſt pleaſaunte to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes of the body: but as reaſon teacheth them, and God commaundeth them, for the ſurer ſaluacion of their ſoules. For the children of vanitie embrace that onely which the ſenſuall appetite deſireth, and reiecte that which reaſon commaundeth. Since the time that trées were created, they alwayes (remayning in the firſte nature) vntil this preſent day, doe beare the ſame leafe, and frute which things are playne ſene in this, that the palme beareth dates, the figge trée figges, the nut trée nuttes, the peare trée peares, the apple trée apples, the cheſnutte trée cheſnuttes, the Oke acornes: and to conclude I ſaye all thinges haue kepte their firſte nature, ſaue onely the ſinfull man which hath fallen by malice. The planettes, the ſtarres, the heauens, the water, the earth, the ayre, and the fier: the brute beaſtes, and the fiſhes, al continewe in the ſame eſtate wherein they were firſt created, not complayninge nor enuying one the other. Man complayneth continually, he is neuer ſatiſfied, and alwayes deſireth to chaunge his eſtate. For the ſhepherd woulde be a huſbandman, the huſbandman a ſquier, the ſquier a Knight, the knight a King, the king an Emperour. Therefore I ſay, that few
<pb facs="tcp:21411:4"/>
is the number of them that ſeke amendment of life: but infinite are they that trauaile to better their eſtate, and to encreaſe their goodes. The decaye of the common wealth (at this preſent) through all the worlde is, that the dry and withered okes which haue bene nouriſhed vpon the ſharpe mountaynes, woulde nowe ſeme to be daynetie date trées cheriſhed in the pleaſaunt gardeins. I meane, that thoſe which yeſterday coulde haue ben pleaſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dry acornes in a poore cottage at home: at this day wil not eat but of delicate diſſhes in other mens houſes abroade. What eſtate menne ought to take vppon them to kepe their conſcience pure, and to haue more reſte in their life, a man cannot eaſely deſcribe. For there is no ſtate in the Church of God, but men may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (if they will) ſerue God, and profite them ſelues. Nor there is no kind of life in the world, but the wicked (if they perſeuer and continew therin) may ſclaunder their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and alſo leaſe their ſoules. <hi>Plinie</hi> in an epiſtle that he wrote to <hi>Fabatus</hi> his frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſaith. There is nothing among mortal men more common and daungerous, than to geue place to vayne imaginacions, whereby a man beleueth the eſtate of one to be much better than the eſtate of an other. And hereof it procedeth, that the worlde doth blinde men ſo, that they wil rather ſeke that which is an other mans by trauaile and daunger: than enioy their owne with quiet and reſt. I ſay the ſtate of Princes is good, if they abuſe it not. I ſay the ſtate of the people is good, if they behaue them ſelues o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediently. I ſay the eſtate of the rich is good, if they wil Godly vſe it. I ſay the eſtate of the religious is good, if they be able to profit others. I ſay the eſtate of the communal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is good, if they will contente them ſelues. I ſaye the ſtate of the poore is good, if they haue pacience. For it is no merite to ſuffer many troubles, if we haue not pacience therin. During the time of this our miſerable life we cannot denay, but in euery eſtate there is bothe trouble and daunger. For then onely our eſtate ſhalbe perfit, when we ſhal come gloriouſly in ſoule and body without the feare of deathe: and alſo whan we ſhall reioyce without daungers in life. Retourninge agayne to our purpoſe (mightie Prince) although we all be of value little, we all haue little, we all can attaine little, we all know little, we al are able to doe little, we all do liue but little: Yet in all this little, the ſtate of Princes ſemeth ſome great and high thing. For that worldely men ſay there is no ſuch felicitie in this life, as to haue authoritie to commaunde many, &amp; to be bounde to obey none. But if either ſubiectes knewe how dere Princes by their power to commaunde, or if Princes knewe howe ſwete a thinge it is to liue in quiet: douteleſſe the ſubiectes would pitie their rulers, and the rulers would not enuy theyr ſubiectes. For ful few are the pleaſures which Princes enioy, in reſpecte of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that they endure. Sithe then the eſtate of Princes is greater than al, that he may doe more than all, is more of value than all, vpholdeth more than all, and finally that from thence procedeth the gouernement of all, it is more nedefull that the houſe, the perſon, and the life of a Prince be better gouerned, and ordred, than all the reſte. For euen as by the yard the marchante meaſureth al his ware: ſo by the life of the Prince is meaſured the whole common weale. Many ſorowes endureth the woman in nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing a waywerde childe, great trauaile taketh a ſcholemaiſter in teaching an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towarde ſcholler, much paine taketh an officer in gouerning a multitude ouergreate: howe greate than is the paine and peril, whereunto I offer my ſelfe, in takinge vpon me to order the life of ſuch a one, vpon whoſe life hangeth all the good ſtate of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale. For Princes and great Lords, ought of vs to be ſerued, and not offended: we ought to exhort them, not to vexe them: we ought to entreate them, not to rebuke them: we ought to aduiſe them, and not to defame them: finally I ſay, that right ſimple recken I that ſurgio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which with the ſame plaiſters he layed to a hard héele, ſéeketh to
<pb facs="tcp:21411:5"/>
cure the tender eyes. I meane by this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, that my purpoſe is not to tel princes, and noble men in this booke what they be, but to warne them what they ought to be: not to tell them what they doe, but to aduiſe them what they ought to doe. For that noble man which will not amende his lyfe for remorſe of his owne conſcience, I doe thinke that he wil amende it for the writing of my penne. <hi>Paulus diaconus</hi> the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer in the ſecond booke of his commentaries, ſheweth an antiquitie right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to remember, and alſo pleaſaunt to reade: Although in dede to the hinderaunce of my ſelfe I ſhall reherſe it. It is, as of the henne, who by longe ſcraping on the dong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, diſcouereth the knife that ſhall cut hir owne throte. Thus was the caſe. <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> the moſte renowmed Prince and captayne of <hi>Carthage</hi> (after he was vainquiſhed by thaduenturous <hi>Scipio</hi>) fled into <hi>Aſia</hi> to kinge <hi>Antiochus,</hi> a Prince then liuinge of great vertue, who receiued him into his realme, tooke him into his protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and right honourably enterteyned him in his houſe. And certes king <hi>Antiochus</hi> did herein, as a pitefull Prince: for what can more beautifie the honor of a Prince than to ſuccor nobilitie in their nedefull eſtate. Theſe two Princes vſed diuers exerciſes to ſpende the time honorably, &amp; thus they diuided tyme. Sometime to hunt in the mountaines, otherwhile to diſporte them in the fieldes, oft to vewe their armies: But moſtly, they wente to the ſcholes to heare the Philoſophers. And truly they did like wiſe &amp; ſkilfull men. For there is no hower in a daye otherwiſe ſo well employed, as in hearinge a wiſe pleaſaunt tonged man. There was at a time in <hi>Epheſus</hi> a famous philoſopher called <hi>Phormio,</hi> which openly red and taught the people of that realme. And one day as theſe twoo Princes came into the ſchoole, the philoſopher <hi>Phormio</hi> chaunged the matter whereupon be red, and of a ſodayne began to talke of the meanes and wayes that Princes ought to vſe in warre, &amp; of thorder to be kepte in geuing battaile. Such, ſo ſtraunge, and high phraſed was the matter which he talked of, that not onely they merueiled which neuer before ſawe him: but euen thoſe alſo that of longe tyme had dayly hearde him. For herein curious and flouriſſhing wittes ſhewe their excellency, in that they neuer wante freſh mater to entreate vpon. Greatly gloried the king <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus,</hi> that this philoſopher (in preſence of this ſtraunge prince) had ſo excellentlye ſpoken, ſo that ſtraungers might vnderſtand he had his realme ſtored with wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For couragious and noble princes eſteme nothing ſo precious, as to haue men valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to defend their frontiers: and alſo wiſe to gouerne their commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weales. The lecture<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, king <hi>Antiochus</hi> demaunded of the prince <hi>Hannibal,</hi> howe he liked the talke of the philoſopher <hi>Phormio?</hi> to whome <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſtoutely aunſwered, and in his aunſwere ſhewed him ſelf to be of that ſtoutnes he was the ſame day, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wanne the great battayle at <hi>Cannas.</hi> For although noble harted and couragious princes loſe all their eſtates and realmes: yet they will neuer confeſſe their hartes to be ouerthrowen nor vaynquiſſhed. And theſe were the words that at that time <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſaid. Thou ſhalt vnderſtande kinge <hi>Antiochus,</hi> that I haue ſéene diuers dotinge olde men, yet I neuer ſawe a more dootarde foole than <hi>Phormio,</hi> whom thou cauſeſt ſuch a great philoſopher. For the greateſt kinde of foly is, whan a man that hath but a little vaine ſcience, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth to teach not thoſe which haue only ſcience, but alſo ſuch as haue moſt certeine experience. Tel me (kinge <hi>Antiochus</hi>) what harte can brooke with pacience, or what tonge can ſuffer with ſilence, to ſée a ſely man (as this philoſopher is) nouriſhed all his life time in a corner of <hi>Grece,</hi> ſtudieng philoſophie, to preſume (as he hath done) to talke before the prince <hi>Hannibal</hi> of the affaires of warre, as though he had bene either lorde of <hi>Affrike,</hi> or captayne of <hi>Rome?</hi> Certes he either full little knoweth him ſelf, or els but little eſtemeth vs. For it appeareth by his vaine words, he would ſeme
<pb facs="tcp:21411:5"/>
to know more in matters of warre, by that he hath red in bookes: than doth <hi>Hannibal</hi> by the ſundry and great battayles which he hath fought in the fieldes. O king <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> how far and how great is the difference, betwene the ſtate of philoſophers, &amp; the ſtate of captaynes: betwene the ſkill to reade in ſchole, and the knowledge to rule an armie, betwene the ſcience that theſe wiſe men haue in bookes, and thexperience that thothers haue in warre: betwene their ſkil to write with the penne, and ours to fight with the ſword, betwene one that for his paſtime is ſet round with deſkes of bookes, and an other in perill of life compaſſed with troupes of enemies. For many there are which with great eloquence, in blaſing dedes done in warres, can vſe their tongs: but few are thoſe that at the brunt haue hartes to aduenture their liues. This ſely philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher neuer ſaw man of warre in the field, neuer ſaw one army of men diſcomfeited by an other, neuer heard the terrible trumpet ſound to the horrible &amp; cruel ſlaughter of men, neuer ſaw the treaſons of ſome, nor vnderſtode the cowardnes of other, neuer ſaw how fewe they be that fight, nor how many there are that ronne away. Finally I ſay, as it is ſemely for a philoſopher and a learned man to praiſe the profites of peace: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo it is in his mouth a thing vncomely to prate of the perils of warre. If this phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher hath ſene no one thing with his eyes that he hath ſpoken, but onely red them in ſondry bokes: let him recounte them to ſuch as haue neither ſene nor red them. For warlike feates are better learned in the bloudy fields of <hi>Afrike,</hi> than in the beautifull ſcholes of <hi>Grece.</hi> Thou knoweſt right wel (king <hi>Antiochus</hi>) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for the ſpace of. 36. yeres I had continuall and daungerous warres, aſwell in <hi>Italy</hi> as in <hi>Spayne,</hi> in which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune did not fauor me (as is alwaies her maner to vſe thoſe, which by great ſtoutnes &amp; manhodde enterpriſe things high and of much difficultie) a witnes wherof thou ſéeſt me heare, who before my berde began to grow, was ſerued: &amp; nowe whan it is hore, I my ſelfe begin to ſerue. I ſweare vnto the by the God Mars, (kinge <hi>Antiochus</hi>) that if any man did aſke me how he ſhould vſe and behaue him ſelfe in warre, I would not anſwere him one word. For they are things that are learned by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of déedes, &amp; not by prating in words. Although princes begin warres by iuſtice, and folow them with wiſedome, yet the ende ſtandeth vpon fickle fortune and not of force, nor policie. Diuers other things <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſaide vnto <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who ſo wil ſée the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let him reade the <hi>Apothemes</hi> of <hi>Plutarche.</hi> This example (noble prince) te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth rather to this end, to condempne my boldnes, &amp; not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende my enterpriſe, ſaying that thaffaires of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth be as vnknowen to me, as the daungers of the warres were to <hi>Phor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio.</hi> Your maieſtie may iuſtely ſay vnto me, that I being a poore ſimple man (brought vp a great while in a rude countrey) do greatly preſume to deſcribe, howe ſo puiſſant a prince as your highnes ought to gouerne him ſelf and his realme. For of trueth the more ignoraunt a man is of the troubles and alteracions of the worlde, the better he ſhalbe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in the ſight of God. The eſtate of princes is to haue great traines about them, &amp; the eſtate of religious men, is to be ſolitarye: for the ſeruaunt of God ought to be alwayes voyde from vaine thoughtes, &amp; to be euer accompanied with holy medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The eſtate of princes is alwayes vnquiet: but the ſtate of the religious is to be encloſed. For otherwiſe, he aboue all others may be called an <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> that hath his body in the ſell, and his hart in the market place. To princes it is neceſſary to ſpeake &amp; common with all men: but for the religious it is not decente to be conuerſaunt with the world. For ſolitary men (if they do as they ought) ſhould occupy their hands in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, their body in faſting, their tonge in prayer, &amp; their harte in contemplacion. The eſtate of princes for the moſt part is employed to warre: but the ſtate of the religious is to deſire &amp; procure peace. For if the prince would ſtudy to paſſe his boundes, and by
<pb facs="tcp:21411:6"/>
battaile to ſhed the bloud of his enemies: the religious ought to ſhede teares, &amp; pray to God for his ſinnes. O that it pleaſed almighty God, as I know what my bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is in my hart, ſo that he would giue me grace to accompliſh the ſame in my dedes. Alas, whan I ponder with my ſelfe the waightines of my matter, my penne through ſlothe and negligence is ready to fall out of my hand, &amp; I half minded to leaue of mine enterpriſe. My intent is to ſpeake againſt my ſelfe in this caſe. For albeit men maye know thaffaires of princes by experience: yet they ſhall not know howe to ſpeake nor write the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but by ſcience. Thoſe which ought to counſaile princes, thoſe which ought to refourme the life of princes &amp; that ought to inſtruct them, ought to haue a clere iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, an vpright minde, their words aduiſedly conſidered, their doctrine holeſom, &amp; their life without ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For who ſo wil ſpeake of high things, hauing no expere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of them: is like vnto a blinde man that woulde leade &amp; teach him the way, which ſéeth better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he him ſelf. This is the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>Xenophon</hi> the great which ſaith. There is nothing harder in this life than to know a wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the reaſon which he gaue was this. That a wiſe man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be knowen but by an other wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we maye ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by this which <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſaieth: that as one wiſe man cannot be knowen but by an other wiſe man: ſo lykewiſe it is requiſite that he ſhould be, or haue ben a prince, which ſhould write of the life of a prince. For he that hath ben a mariner, &amp; ſailled but one yere on the ſea: ſhall be able to giue better counſaile and aduiſe, than he that hath dwelled .x. yers in the hauen. <hi>Xenopho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     </hi> wrote a boke touching the inſtitucion of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; bringeth in <hi>Cambiſes</hi> the kyng, how he taughte, and ſpake vnto kyng <hi>Cirus</hi> hys ſonne. And he wrote an other booke likewiſe of the arte of cheualrye, and brought in kyng Phillip, how he oughte to teache his ſonne Alexander to fight. For the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers thought that writting of no auctoritie, that was not intituled &amp; ſet forth vnder the name of thoſe princes, which had experience of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wrate. O if an aged prince would with his penne (if not with worde of mouth) declare, what miſfortunes haue happened ſins the firſt time he began to reigne, howe diſobedient his ſubiectes haue ben vnto him, what griefe his ſeruauntes haue wrought againſt him, what vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes his frendes haue ſhewed him, what ſubtile wiles his enemies haue vſed towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des hym, what daunger his perſon hath eſcaped, what tarres haue ben in his palace, what faultes they haue ſaid againſt him, how many times they haue deceiued ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, finally what grefes he hath had by day, &amp; what ſorrowful ſighes he hath fetched in the night: truly I thinke (&amp; in my thought I am nothing deceaued) that if a prynce wold declare vnto vs his hole lif, &amp; that he wold particularly ſhew vs euery thing, we wold both wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der at that body which had ſo much ſuffered: &amp; alſo we wold be offended with that hart that had ſo greatly diſſembled. It is a troubleſom thing a daungerous thing, &amp; an inſolent and proud entrepriſe, for a man to take vpon him with a penne to gouerne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, &amp; with a prince to reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his life. For in dede men are not perſwaded to liue wel by faire words, but by vertuous dedes And therfore not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out cauſe I ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is not wiſe, but very arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dare preſume vnaſked to giue a pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce counſail. For princes in many thinges haue their mindes occupied, &amp; haughtely bent, &amp; ſom of them alſo are affectioned, &amp; where as we (peraduenture) thinke to haue them mercifull, we finde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more angry &amp; heauy againſt vs. For counſaile doth more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me than profite, if the giuer therof be not very wiſe, &amp; he alſo which receiueth it very pacient. I haue not ben a prince to know the trauailes of princes, nor am not as preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to counſel princes: yet I was ſo bolde to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pile this booke, it was not vppon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to counſaile a prince, ſo much as by an humble ſorte to giue mine aduiſe.</p>
                  <p>For to giue counſel, I confeſſe I haue no credite: but to giue theim aduiſe, it ſuffiſeth
<pb facs="tcp:21411:6"/>
me to be a ſubiecte. What the order is that I haue taken in this boke, how profitable it is to all men, &amp; how vnpleaſaunt to no man, how holſome &amp; profound doctrine in it is conteined, &amp; how the hiſtories be herin applied; I wil not that my pen do write, but they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues ſhal iudge which ſhal reade this worke. We ſe it oft com to paſſe that diuers bokes do loſe their eſtimation, not for that they are not very good &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: but becauſe the auctour hath ben to preſumptuous &amp; vainglorious. For in my opinion, for a man to praiſe his owne writinges much, is nothing els but to giue men occaſion to ſpeake euil both of him &amp; of his worke. Let no man thinke that I haue written thys which is written, without great aduiſement and examination. I do confeſſe before the redemer of the whole world, that I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed ſo many yers to ſeke what I ſhold write, that this .ii. yers one day hath ſcarſely eſcaped me, wherin my pen hath not don his dutie to write or correct in this worke. I confeſſe that I toke great paine in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, for of trueth it hath ben written twiſe with mine owne hand, and thriſe with another mans hand. I confeſſe I haue red &amp; ſearched in diuers &amp; ſondrie partes, many and good ſtrange bokes, to thend I might finde good and pleaſant doctrine, &amp; beſydes that I trauailed much to ſet &amp; apply the hiſtories to the purpoſe. For it is an vnſeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing to apply an hiſtory without a purpoſe. I had great reſpecte in that I was not ſo briefe in my writinges, that a man might note me to be obſcure: nor yet in anye thing ſo long, that a man ſhold ſclaunder me with to much talke. For al the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of writing conſiſteth, where many &amp; goodly ſentences are declared in few &amp; apte wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: For oft times the long ſtile is lothſom &amp; tedious both to the hearers &amp; readers. <hi>Nero</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> emperour was in loue with a lady in <hi>Rome</hi> named <hi>Pompeia,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (to his fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſie) exceded all other.

                     <hi>Nero</hi> was ſo in loue with theſe héeres of <hi>Pompeia,</hi> which wer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> colour of amber, al the ladies endeuoured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, not only to make artificially their here of that colour: but alſo to were their garmentes, and other attyres of the ſame colour, in ſomuche that bothe
<pb facs="tcp:21411:7"/>
men and women did vſe collers of amber, brooches &amp; ringes ſet with amber, &amp; al their other Iewels were of amber. For alwayes it hath ben ſene, &amp; euer ſhallbe, that thoſe things wherunto the prince is moſt addicted, the people folow, &amp; aboue al other couet the ſame. Before this Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> plaied this light part in <hi>Rome,</hi> the amber ſtone was had in little eſtimacion, &amp; after that he ſet ſo muche by it, there was no precious ſtone in <hi>Rome</hi> ſo much eſtemed. Yea &amp; furthermore the marchant gained nothinge ſo much (whether it were in gold or ſilke) as he did in the amber ſtones, nor brought any kind of marchaundiſe to <hi>Rome</hi> more precious, or more vendible than that was. I doe meruelle at this vanitie, foraſmuch as the children of the world do loue, deſire, &amp; labor more to folow the ſtraunge foly of an other: than to furniſh &amp; ſupply their own proper neceſſitie. Therefore retourning againe to my purpoſe (moſt excellent prince) by this example you may coniecture, what I would ſay, that is, that if this writing were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted vnto princes, I am aſſured it woulde be refuſed of no man: And if any man would ſlaunderouſly talke of it, he durſt not, remembring that your maieſtie hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued it. For thoſe things which princes take to their cuſtody, we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to defend, &amp; it is not lawfull for vs to diminiſh their credite. Suppoſe that this my worke were not ſo profound as it might be of this matter, nor with ſuch eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſet out as many other bokes are: yet I dare be bolde to ſay, that the prince ſhal take more profit by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this worke, than <hi>Nero</hi> did by his loue <hi>Pompeia.</hi> For in the end, by reading and ſtudieng good bookes, men tourne, &amp; become ſage and wiſe: and by keping il company, they are counted fooles &amp; vitious. My meaning is not, nor I am not ſo importunat and vnreaſonable, to perſwade princes that they ſhould ſo fauour my doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it ſhould be in like eſtimacion now in theſe partes, as the amber was there in <hi>Rome.</hi> But that which only I require &amp; demaund is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the time which <hi>Nero</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in ſinging &amp; telling y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> héeres of his loue <hi>Pompeia,</hi> ſhould now be employed to redreſſe the wrongs &amp; faultes of the common wealth. For the noble &amp; worthy prince ought to employ the leaſt part of the day in the recreation of his perſon. After he hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> audience to his counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, to the embaſſadours, to the great Lordes &amp; prelates, to the riche and poore, to his owne countrey men and ſtraungers, &amp; after that he be come into his priuy chamber, then my deſire is that he would reade this treatiſe, or ſome other better than this: for in princes chambers oftentimes thoſe of the priuie cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber and other their familiares loaſe great time, in reciting vayne and trifling maters and of ſmall profit, the which might better be ſpent in reading ſome good booke. In al worldly affaires that we do, &amp; in al our bookes which we compile, it is a greate matter to be fortunate. For to a man that fortune doth not fauour, diligence (without doute) can little auaile. Admitte that fortune were againſt me, in that this my worke ſhould be acceptable vnto your maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, without compariſon it ſhould be a great grief &amp; diſhonor vnto me, to tel you what ſhould be good to reade for your paſtime, if on thother parte you woulde not profite by mine aduiſe. For my mind was not only to make this booke, to the end princes ſhould reade it for a paſtime, but to that end (in recreating the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues) ſomtimes they mought thereby alſo take profit. <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> in the. 12. chapter of his thirde booke entituled <hi>De nocte attica,</hi> ſaid that amongs al the ſchollers which the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> had, one was named <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> a man amongeſt the Gréekes moſte highly eſtemed &amp; of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes</hi> greatly deſired. Becauſe he was in his liuing ſeuere, and in his tonge and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine a very ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had come in the time of <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tiraunt, whan <hi>Grecia</hi> was peopled with tirau tes, and that he had not bene in <hi>Platoes</hi> tyme, when it was repleniſhed with Philoſophers, truelye <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> had bene as cleare a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne in <hi>Aſia,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> the greate was in <hi>Europe.</hi> Greate good happe hath a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="tcp:21411:7"/>
man to be borne in one age, more then in any other. I meane, that if a valiaunt Knight come in the tyme of a couragious and ſtout prince, ſuch one truly ſhalbe eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſet in great authoritie. But if he come in the time of an other effeminate and couetous prince, he ſhall not be regarded at al. For he wil rather eſteme one that wil augment his treaſour at home: than him that can vanquiſhe his enemies in battayle abrode. So likewiſe it chaunſeth to wiſe and vertuous men, which if they come in the time of vertuous and learned princes, are eſtemed and honoured: But if they come in tyme of vayne and vitious princes, they make ſmall accounte of them. For it is an auncient cuſtome amonge vanities children, not to honor him which to the common wealth is moſt profitable: but him whiche to the prince is moſt acceptable. The ende why this is ſpoken <hi>(Moſt puſant Prince)</hi> is becauſe the twoo renoumed philoſophers were in <hi>Grece</hi> both at one time: and becauſe the diuine philoſopher <hi>Plato</hi> was ſo much eſtemed and made of, they did not greatly eſteme the philoſopher <hi>Demoſthenes.</hi> For the emine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and high renoume of one alone, diminiſheth the fame &amp; eſtimacion (amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the people) of many. Although <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> was ſuch a one in dede as we haue ſayd, that is to witte, eloquent of tonge, ready of memory, ſharpe and quicke of witte, in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſeuere, ſure and profitable in geuing of counſaile, in renoume excellent, in yeres very auncient, and in philoſophie a man right wel learned: Yet he refuſed not to goe to the ſcholes of <hi>Plato</hi> to heare morall philoſophie. He that ſhall reade this thinge or heare it, ought not to merueile, but to folow it, and to profit likewiſe in the ſame: that is to vnderſtande, that one philoſopher learned of an other, and one wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuffered him ſelfe to be taught of an other. For knowledge is of ſuch a qualitie, that the more a man knoweth, dayly there encreaſeth in him a deſire to knowe more. All thinges of this life (after they haue bene taſted and poſſeſſed) cloyeth a man, wearieth and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth him, true ſcience onely excepted, which neuer doth cloy, weary, nor troble them. And if it happen we wery any, it is but the eyes which are weried with lokinge and reading: and not the ſpirite with féeling and taſtinge. Many Lordes and my familiar friendes doe aſke me how it is poſſible I ſhoulde liue with ſo much ſtudy? And I alſo demaunde of them, how it is poſſible they ſhould liue in ſuch continuall idelnes? For conſidering the prouocacion and aſſaultes of the fleſh, the daungers of the world, the temptacions of the deuil, the treaſons of enemies, &amp; importunities of friendes: what hart can ſuffer ſo great and continual trauaile, but onely in reading &amp; comforting him ſelfe in bookes? Truely a man ought to haue more compaſſion of a ſimple ignoraunte man, than of a poore man. For there is no greater pouerty vnto a man, than to lacke wiſdome whereby he ſhould know how to gouerne him ſelfe. Therefore folowinge our matter the caſe was ſuch, one day <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> (going to the ſchole of <hi>Plato</hi>) ſawe in the market place of <hi>Athens</hi> a greate aſſembly of people, which were hearing a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher newely come vnto that place: &amp; he ſpake not this without a cauſe, that there was a greate companye of people aſſembled. For that naturallye the common people are deſirous to heare new and ſtraunge things. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> aſked what philoſopher he was after whome ſo many people went? and when it was aunſwered him that it was <hi>Caliſtratus</hi> the philoſopher, a man which in eloquence was very ſwéete and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt: he determined to ſtaie and heare him, to thende he woulde knowe whither it were true or vayne that the people tolde hym. For oftentymes it happeneth, that amonge the people ſome gette them ſelues greate fame, more by fauour, than by good learninge. The difference betwixte the diuine Philoſopher <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Caliſtratus</hi> was, in that <hi>Plato</hi> was exceadinglye well learned, and the other very eloquente: and thus it came to paſſe, that in liuinge they folowed <hi>Plato:</hi> and in eloquence of ſpeache
<pb facs="tcp:21411:8"/>
they did imitate <hi>Calliſtratus.</hi> For there are diuers menne ſufficiently well learned, whiche haue profounde doctrine, but they haue no waye nor meanes to teache it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> hearing <hi>Caliſtratus</hi> but ones, was ſo far in loue with his doctrine, that he neuer after hearde <hi>Plato,</hi> nor entred into his ſcole, for to harken to any of his lectures. At which newes diuers of the ſages of <hi>Grecia</hi> marueiled much, ſeing that the tonge of a man was of ſuch power, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it had put all their doctrine to ſcilence. Although I apply not this example, I doute not but your maieſtie vnderſtandeth to what end I haue declared it. And moreouer I ſay, that although Princes haue in their chambers bookes ſo well corrected, and men in their courtes ſo wel learned, that they may wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely kéepe theſtimacion which <hi>Plato</hi> had in his ſchole: yet in this caſe it ſhoulde not diſpleaſe me, that the difference that was betwen <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Caliſtratus,</hi> ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene Princes and this booke. God forbidde, that by this ſayeng men ſhould thinke I meane to diſſwade Princes from the company of the ſage men, or from reading of any other booke but this: for in ſo doinge, <hi>Plato</hi> ſhoulde be reiected which was diuine: and <hi>Caliſtratus</hi> embraced which was more wordly. But my deſire is, that ſometime they would vſe to reade this booke a little, for it may chaunce they ſhal finde ſome holſome counſayle therein, which at one tyme or other may profite them in their affaires. For the good &amp; careful Princes ought to graffe in their memory y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſe ſayings which they reade, &amp; forget the canekred iniuries &amp; wronges which are done the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I do not ſpeake it without a cauſe, that he that readeth this my writing ſhall finde in it ſome profitable counſaile. For all that which hath bene writen in it, hath bene in euery worde &amp; ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with great diligence ſo wel weyed, and corrected, as if therein onely conſiſted, the effecte of the whole worke. The greateſt griefe that learned menne feele in their writing is, to thinke, that if there be many that view their doings, to take profit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: they ſhall perceiue that there are as many moe, which occupy their tonges in the ſclaunder and diſprayſe thereof. In publiſhinge this my worke, I haue obſerued the maner of them that plant a new gardein, wherein they ſet Roſes which giue a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt ſauour to the noſe, they make faire grene plattes to delight the eyes, they graft fruitful trées to be gathered with the handes, but in the end as I am a man, ſo haue I written it for menne, and conſequently as a man I may haue erred: for there is not at this daye ſo perſite a painter, but another will preſume to amende his worke. Thoſe which dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly wil endeuour themſelues to reade this booke, ſhall find in it very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable counſailes, very liuely lawes, good reaſons, notable ſayinges, ſentences very profound, worthy examples, &amp; hiſtories very ancient. For to ſay the trueth, I had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect in that the doctrine was auncient, &amp; the ſtile new. And albeit your maieſty be the greateſt Prince of all Princes, and I the leaſt of all your ſubiectes, you ought not for my baſe condicion to diſdayne to caſt your eyes vppon this booke, nor to thinke ſcorne to put that thing in proofe which ſemeth good. For a good letter ought to be nothing the leſſe eſtemed, although it be written with an euill penne. I haue ſayde, and will ſay, that Princes and greate Lordes, the ſtouter, the richer, and the greater of renoume they be, the greater nede they haue of all men of good knowledge about them, to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeil them in their affaires, and of good bookes which they maye reade: and this they ought to do aſwel in proſperitie as in aduerſitie, to the end that their affaires in time conueniente, may be debated and redreſſed. For otherwiſe, they ſhoulde haue time to repent, but no leaſure to amende. <hi>Plinie, Marcus Varro, Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Macrobius,</hi> (which were hiſtoriographers no leſſe graue than true) were at greate controuerſie, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge what thinges were moſt autentike in a common weale, and at what time they were of all menne accepted. <hi>Seneca</hi> in a piſtle he wrote to <hi>Lucillus,</hi> prayſed without
<pb facs="tcp:21411:8"/>
ceſſing the common wealth of the <hi>Rhodiens,</hi> in the which (with much a doe) they bent them ſelues altogether to kepe one ſelfe thinge, and after they had therupon agréed, they kept and mainteyned it inuiolately. The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the ſixte booke entituled <hi>De legibus,</hi> ordeyned and commaunded that if any citizen did inuente any new thing, which neuer before was reade, nor harde of, the inuentour thereof ſhould firſt practiſe the ſame for the ſpace of .10. yeares in his owne houſe, before it was brought into the common wealth, and before it ſhold be publiſhed vnto the people, to thende if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencion were good, it ſhould be profitable vnto him: and if it were noughte, that than the daunger and hurte therof ſhould lighte onely on him. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his <hi>Apothemes</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Licurgus</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greauous penalties did prohibite, that none ſhould be ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye in his common wealthe to goe wanderinge into ſtraunge countreys, nor that he ſhoulde be ſo hardy to admit any ſtraungers to come into his houſe: and the cauſe why this lawe was made, was to thende ſtraungers ſhoulde not bringe into their houſes thinges ſtraunge, and not accuſtomed in their common wealthe, and that they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing through ſtraunge contreis, ſhoulde not learne newe cuſtomes. The preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of menne now a dayes is ſo great, and the conſideracion of the people ſo ſmall, that what ſo euer a man can ſpeake he ſpeaketh, what ſo euer he can inuente he doth inuente, what he would he doth write, and it is no marueill, for there is no man that will ſpeake againſte them. Nor the common people in this caſe are ſo lighte, that amonges them you may dayly ſée new deuiſes, and whether it hurt or profit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth they force not. If there came at this day a vayne man amonges the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which was neuer ſene nor hearde of before, if he be any thing ſubtile, I aſke you but this queſtion: ſhal it not be eaſy for him to ſpeake and inuente what he liſteth, to ſet forth what he pleaſeth, to perſwade that which to him ſéemeth good, and al his ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enges to be beleued? Truly it is a wonderfull thinge, and no leſſe ſclaunderous, that one ſhoulde be ſufficient to peruerte the ſences and iudgementes of all, and all not able to repreſſe the lightnes and vanitie of one. Things that are newe and not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed, neither princes ought to allowe, nor yet the people to vſe. For a newe thinge oughte no leſſe to be examined and conſidered, before it be brought into the common wealth: than the greate doutes whiche aryſe in mennes myndes. <hi>Rufinus</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of his ſeconde booke of his apologie reproueth greately the Egyptians becauſe they were to full of deuiſes, and blamed much the Grecians becauſe they were to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in ſpeaking fine wordes: &amp; aboue all other he greately prayſeth the <hi>Romaynes,</hi> for that they were very harde of belife, &amp; that they ſcarcely alweyes credited the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Grekes, and becauſe they were diſcrete in admitting the inuencions of the Egyptians. The author hath reaſon to prayſe thone, and diſprayſe thother. For it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth of a light iudgement, to credite al the thinges that a man heareth, and to doe al thinges that he ſéeth. Returninge therefore now to our matter. <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> ſayde there were .5. thinges in the worlde very harde to bringe in, whereof none (after they were commonly accepted) were euer loſt or forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for euen as things vainely bego<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are eaſely left of: ſo things with great feare accepted, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> much diligence are obſerued.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing that chiefly thoroughout al the world was accepted, was al men to liue togethers: that is to ſay, they ſhould make places, townes, villages, cities &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon wealthes. For according to the ſaying of <hi>Plato,</hi> the firſt &amp; beſt inuentours of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> antes, which (according to thexperie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we ſée) do liue togethers, trauaile togethers, do go togethers, &amp; alſo for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> winter thei make prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> togethers, &amp; furthermore none of theſe antes do geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to any priuat thing, but al theirs is brought into their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welth. It is a meruelous thing to behold the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welth
<pb facs="tcp:21411:9"/>
of the antes, how netely they trim their hilles, to beholde howe they ſwepe away the graine when it is wet, and how they drye it whan they fele any moiſture, to beholde how they come from their worke, and how the one doth not hurt the other: And to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold alſo how they doe reioyce the one in the others trauaile, and that which is to our greateſt confuſion is, that if it come ſo to paſſe, 50000. antes will liue in a little hillocke togethers: and two men onely cannot liue in peace and concorde in a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. Woulde to God the wiſedome of men were ſo great to kepe them ſelues, as the prudence of the antes is to liue. Whan the world came to a certayne age, &amp; mens wittes waxed more fine, than tirantes ſprange vp which oppreſſed the poore, theues that robbed the riche, rebelles that robbed the quiet, murderers that ſlew the pacient, the ydell that eate the ſwete of other mens browes: all the which thinges conſidered by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were vertuous, they agréed to aſſemble &amp; liue together, that therby they might preſerue the good, and withſtande the wicked. <hi>Macrobius</hi> affirmeth this in the ſeconde booke of <hi>Scipions</hi> dreame ſaying, that couetouſnes and auarice was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt cauſe why men inuented the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth. <hi>Plinie</hi> in the ſeuenth booke .56. chap. ſayth, the firſt that made ſmall aſſembles, were the <hi>Atheniens:</hi> and the firſt that builte great cities, were the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi>

                  <p>The ſeconde thinge that was accepted throughout all the worlde, were the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whiche we reade, whereby we take profite in writinge. Accordinge whereunto <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> ſaith, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> prayſe them ſelues and ſay, that they did inuente them: and the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> affirme the contrary, and ſweare that they were ſhewed firſte of all amongſt them. <hi>Plinie</hi> in the ſeuenth booke ſaith, that in the firſt age, there was in the alphabet no more than 16. letters, &amp; that greate <hi>Palamedes</hi> at the ſiege of <hi>Troye,</hi> added other .4. and Ariſtotle ſaithe, that immediatly after the beginninge there were founde .18. letters. And that afterwardes <hi>Palamedes</hi> did adde but .2. and ſo there were 20. and that the Philoſopher <hi>Epicarmus</hi> dyd adde other two, which were .22. it is no great matter, whether the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> or the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> firſt founde the letters. But I ſay and affirme, that it was a thing neceſſary for a common wealth, and alſo for then<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of man knowledge. For if we had wanted letters, and writings, we could haue had no knowledge of the tyme paſt, nor yet our poſteritie coulde haue ben aduertiſed what was done in our dayes. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the ſecond booke entituled <hi>De viris illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> in the ſeuenth booke and .56. chapiter, doe greately prayſe <hi>Pirotas,</hi> by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he firſte founde the fier in a flinte ſtone. They greatly commended <hi>Protheus,</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he inuented harneis, and they highly extolled <hi>Panthaſuca,</hi> bicauſe ſhe inuented the hatchet. They prayſed <hi>Citheus,</hi> becauſe he inuented the bowe, and the arrowes. they greatelye prayſed <hi>Pheniſeus,</hi> becauſe he inuented the croſſe bowe and the ſlinge. They highly prayſed the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> becauſe they inuented the helmet, the ſpere, and the ſword. They commende thoſe of <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> bicauſe they inuented the combate on horſeback, and they commende thoſe of <hi>Affrike,</hi> becauſe they inuented the fight by ſea. But I doe prayſe, and continually will magnifie, not thoſe which founde the arte of fightinge, and inuented weapons to procure warre, for to kill his neighbour: but thoſe which found letters, for to learne ſcience, &amp; to make peace betwene two princes. What difference there is to wet the penne with inke, and to paynte the ſpere with bloud: to be enuironned with bookes, or to be laden with weapons. To ſtudy how eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ought to liue, or els to goe priuely and robbe in the warres, &amp; to lie in waight to kill his neighbour: There is none of ſo vaine a iudgement, but wil praiſe more the ſpeculation of the ſciences, than the practiſe of the warre. Becauſe that in the end, he that learneth ſciences, learneth nought els but how he and others ought to lyue. And
<pb facs="tcp:21411:9"/>
he that learneth warlike feates, learneth none other thinge than howe to ſley his neighbour, and to deſtroye others.</p>
                  <p>The thirde thinge, that equally of all was accepted, were lawes. For admit that al men now liued togethesr in common, if they would not be ſubiect one to another, there woulde contention ariſe amongeſt them, for that accordinge to the ſayinge of <hi>Plato,</hi> there is no greater token of the diſtruction of a common weale, than whan many rulers are choſen therein. <hi>Plinie</hi> in his ſeuenth booke .56. chapter ſayth, that a Quéene called <hi>Ceres,</hi> was the firſt that taught them to ſowe in the fieldes, to grinde in milles, to paſte and bake in ouens, and alſo ſhe was the firſt that taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to liue according to the lawe. And by the meanes of all theſe thinges our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers called her a goddeſſe. Since that time we neuer haue ſene heard nor red of any realme, or other nation (aſwell ſtraunge as barbarous) what ſo euer they were, but haue had lawes whereby the good were fauoured, and alſo inſtitutions of greuous paynes wherewith the wicked were puniſhed. Although truely I had rather, and it were better, that the good ſhoulde loue reaſon: than feare the lawe. I ſpeake of thoſe which leaue to doe euill workes, for feare onely of fallinge into the puniſhementes appointed for euill doers. For although men approue that which they doe, yet God condemneth that which they deſire. <hi>Seneca</hi> in an epiſtle he wrot to his friend <hi>Lucille,</hi> ſayde theſe wordes. Thou writeſt vnto me <hi>Lucille,</hi> that thoſe of the yle of <hi>Scicili,</hi> haue caried a great quantitie of corne into Spaine, and into <hi>Affrike,</hi> the which thing was forbidden by a Romayne lawe, and therefore they haue deſerued greuous puni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nowe becauſe thou arte vertuous, thou mayſt teache me to do wel, and I that am olde wil teach the to ſay, wel: &amp; this is becauſe that amongeſt wyſe and vertuous men it is enoughe to ſaye, that the lawe commaundeth, appointeth, and ſuffereth this thing, but in as much as it is agreing with reaſon. For the crowne of the good, is reaſon, and the ſcourge of the wicked, is the lawe.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing that commonly through the worlde amongeſt all men was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, was the barbars. And let no man take this thing in mockery. For if they doe reade <hi>Plinie</hi> in the .59. chapiter the ſeuenth booke, they ſhal finde for a truth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines wer in <hi>Rome</hi> .454. yeres without pouling or ſhauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hayres of the beard of any man. <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Publius Ticinius,</hi> was the firſte that brought the barbers from <hi>Scicili</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> But admitte it were ſo or otherwiſe: yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge there was a greate contention amonge the Romaynes. For they ſayde, they thought it a raſhe thinge for a man to committe his life to the courteſie of another. <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the <hi>Siracuſan</hi> neuer truſted his beard with any barbor, but wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were very little, they clipped his beard with ſiſers: but after they became great, he woulde not put his truſt in them to trimme his bearde, but he him ſelfe did burne it with the ſhales of nuttes. This <hi>Dioniſius Siracuſan,</hi> was demanded why he would not truſt any barbours w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his beard. He anſwered, becauſe I know that ther be ſome which wil geue more to the barbor to take away my life, than I wil giue to trimme my beard. <hi>Plinie</hi> in the ſeuenth booke ſaith, that the great <hi>Scipio</hi> called <hi>African,</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour Auguſtus, wer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt that cauſed them in Rome to ſhaue their beards. And I thinke thend why <hi>Plinie</hi> ſpake theſe things, was to exalte theſe twoo princes which had as greate courage to ſuffer the rayſours touche their throtes: as thone for to fight againſt <hi>Hannibal</hi> in <hi>Afrike,</hi> and thother againſt <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> in <hi>Scicili.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fifte thing which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly through the world was accepted, were the dialles and clockes, which the Romaines wanted a long tyme. For as <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> ſay, the Romaines were without clockes in Rome, for the ſpace of .595. yeres.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:10"/>
The curious hyſtoriographers declare thre maner of dialles that were in olde time that is to ſay, dialles of the houres, dialles of the ſonne, and dialls of the water. The dialle of the ſon <hi>Aneximenides Milleſius</hi> inuented, who was great <hi>Animandras</hi> ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler The dialle of the water. <hi>Scipio Naſica</hi> inuented, and the Diall of houres, one of the ſcholers of <hi>Thales</hi> the Phyloſopher inuented Of all theſe antiquities whyche were brought into <hi>Rome,</hi> none of them were ſo acceptable to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> as the dialles were, wherby they meaſured the daye by the houre. For before they could not ſaye, we wil ryſe at .vii. of the clocke, we will dine at .x. we will ſee one thother at .xii. at .i. we will doe that we oughte to doe. But before they ſayde, after the ſonne is vp we wil doe ſuch a thinge, and before it goe downe we wyll doe that we ought to doe. Thoccaſion of declaryng vnto you theſe .v. antiquities in this preamble, was to no other intente, but to call my booke the Dial of Prynces. The name of the booke veing newe (as it is) maye make the learning that is therein greatly to be eſtemed.</p>
                  <p>God forbyd that I ſhould be ſo bolde to ſaye, they haue ben ſo longe time in Spayne without dialles of learning, as they were in <hi>Rome</hi> without the diall of the ſonne, the water, and of the houres. For that in Spayne haue ben alwayes men well learned in ſciences, and very expert in the warres. By great reaſon and of greater occaſion, the Princes oughte to be commended, the knyghtes, the people, their wittes, and the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilitye of their countrey: but yet to all theſe goodnes, I haue ſene manye vnlearned bookes in ſpayne, which as broken dialles deſerue to be caſt into the fier to be forged anew. I do not ſpeake it without a cauſe, that manye bookes deſerue to be broken and burnte. For there are ſo many that without ſhame and honeſtie doe ſet forthe bookes of loue of the worlde, at this daye as boldely, as if they taught theim to diſpiſe and ſpeake euil of the world. It is pitye to ſee how many dayes and nightes be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, in readyng vayne bookes (that is to ſay) as Orſon and Valentine, the Courte of Venus, &amp; the .iiii. ſonnes of Amon, and diuerſe other vaine bokes, by whoſe doctrine I dare boldlye ſay, they paſſe not the tyme but in perdicion: for they learne not how they oughte to flye vice, but rather what way they may with more pleaſour embrace it. This dial of princes is not of ſande, nor of the ſonne, nor of the houres, nor of the water, but it is the dial of lyfe. For that other dialles ſerue to know, what houre it is in the nyghte, and what houre it is of the day: but this ſheweth and teacheth vs, how we ought to occupye our mindes, and how to order our lyfe. The propertye of other dyalles is, to order thinges publyke: but the nature of this dyal of prynces is, to teache vs how to occupye our ſelues euery houre, and how to amende our lyfe euery momente. It lytle auayleth to keape the dyalles well, and to ſee thy ſubiectes diſſolutely without any order, to range in routes, and dayly rayſe debate and contention amonge them ſelues.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He greateſt vanitye that I find in the world is, that vayne men are not only conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be vaine in their life: but alſo procure to leue a memory of their vanity after their death. For it is ſo thought good vnto vaine and light men, whyche ſerue the worlde in vaine workes: that at the houre of death, when they perceyue they can do no more, &amp; that they can no lenger preuaile, they offer them ſelues vnto death, which now they ſee approche vpon them Manye of the world are ſo fleſhed in the world, that although it forſaketh them in déedes: yet they wyl not forſake it in theyr deſires. And I durſt ſweare, that if the world could graunt them perpetual life they woulde promyſe it alwayes to remaine in their cuſtomable follye. O what a nomber of vaine men are aliue, whiche haue neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of god to ſerue him, nor of his glorye to obey him, nor of their conſcience to make it cleane: but like brute beaſts folow and ronne after their voluptuous plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours The brute beaſt is angrye if a man kepe him to much in awe: if he be wery he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his reſt, he ſlepeth when he lyſteth, he eateth and drinketh when he commeth vnto it, and vnles he be compelled he doth nothing, he taketh no care for the common welth, for he neither knoweth how to folow reaſon, nor yet how to reſiſt ſenſualitie. Therfore if a man at al times ſhould eate when he deſireth, reuenge himſelfe when he is moued, commit adultrie when he is tempted, drinke when he is thriſtie, and ſlepe when he is drouſey, we might more properly cal ſuch a one a beaſte nouriſhed in the mountaines: than a man brought vp in the common wealth. For him properly we maye cal a man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gouerneth him ſelf like a man, that is to ſay, conformable vnto ſuch things as reaſon willeth, and not wher ſenſuality leadeth. Let vs leaue theſe vaine men whyche are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, and talke of them that be dead, againſt whom we dare ſay, that whyles they were in the world they folowed the world, &amp; liued according to the ſame. It is not to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled at that ſins they were lyuing in the worlde, they were noted of ſome worldlye point. But ſeing their vnhappy and wicked life is ended: why wil they then ſmel of the vanities of the world in their graues? It is a great ſhame and diſhonor for men of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; ſtout harts, to ſe in one minut thend of our life, and neuer to ſee the end of our fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. We neither read, heare, nor ſe any thing more common, then ſuche men as be moſt vnprofitable in the comon wealth, and of life moſt reprobate, to take vpon them moſt honour whiles they liue, and to leaue behind them the greateſt memorye at their death. What vanity can be greater in the world, then to eſteme the world whych eſtemeth no man, and to make no compt of god who ſo greatly regardeth al men? what a greater fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can ther be in man, then by muche trauaile to encreaſe his goodes, and with vaine pleaſours to loſe his ſoule? It is an olde plague in mannes nature, that many (or the moſt parte of menne) leaue the amendment of their life farre behind: to ſet their honor the more before. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> in the firſt booke of the Emperours ſayth, that <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> (no further thenne in Spaine, in the Citye of <hi>Cales</hi> nowe called <hi>Calis</hi>) ſawe in the temple the triumphes of Alexander the great paynted, the whyche when he hadde wel vewed, he ſighed marueilous ſoore, and beinge aſked why he dyd ſo, he aunſwered: What a wofull caſe am I in, that am now of thage of .30. yeres, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> at the ſame yeres had ſubdued the whole worlde, and reſted him in Babilon. And I (being as I am) a Romaine, neuer dyd yet thyng woorthy of prayſe in my lyfe, nor ſhal leaue any renoume of me after my death. <hi>Dion</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> in the ſecond boke <hi>de Audacia</hi> ſaythe, that the noble <hi>Druſius,</hi> the Almayne, vſed to viſite the graues and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:11"/>
tombes of the famous and renowmed which were buried in Italy, and did this alwaies, eſpecially at his going to warfare, and it was aſked him why he did ſo, he aunſwered. I vyſite the ſepulchers of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and of diuers others which are dead, before whom al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth trembled when they were alyue: For in beholdyng their proſperous ſucceſſe, I dyd recouer both ſtrength, and ſtoutnes. He ſayth furthermore, that it encourageth a man to fight againſt hys enemies, remembring he ſhal leaue of him a memory in time to come. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth in his Rhethorike, and alſo <hi>Plynie</hi> maketh mencion of the ſame in an epiſtle: that there came from <hi>Thebes</hi> (in <hi>Egipt</hi>) a knight to Rome, for no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but onelye to ſee whether it were true or no, that was reported of the notable thinges of Rome. Whom <hi>Mecenas</hi> demaunded, what he perceyued of the Romaynes, and what he thought of Rome. He aunſwered: the memorye of the abſente dooth more content me, then the glory of the preſent doth ſatiſfye me. And the reaſon of this is. The deſire which men haue to extol the lyuing, and to be equal vnto the dead: maketh thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſo ſtraunge in their lyfe, that they deſerue immortal fame after their death. The Romaynes reioyſed not a litle, to heare ſuch wordes of a ſtraungers mouth, wherby he prayſed them whych were departed, and exalted them that yet lyued. O what a thing it is to conſider the auncient heathens, whych neyther feared hel not hoped for heauen, &amp; yet by remembraunce of weakenes, they toke vnto them ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by cowardnes, they were boldened: through feare, they became hardy: of daungers they toke encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: of enemies they made frendes: of pouertye they toke pacience: of malyce they learned experience: finally I ſay, they denied their owne willes, &amp; folowed thopinions of others, only to leaue behind them a memory with the dead, and to haue a lytle honor with the lyuing O how many are they that truſt the vnconſtauntnes of fortune, only to leaue ſome notable memorye behind them. Let vs cal to mynd ſome worthy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, wherby they may ſe that to be true, which I haue ſpoken. What made king <hi>Ninus</hi> to inuent ſuch warres? Quene <hi>Semiramis</hi> to make ſuch buildings? <hi>Vliſſes</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> to ſulke ſo many ſeas? king Alexander to conquere ſo many landes? <hi>Hercules</hi> the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bane</hi> to ſet vp his pillers where he did? <hi>Caius Ceſar</hi> the Romayne to giue .52. battailes at his pleaſure? <hi>Cirus</hi> king of <hi>Perſia</hi> to ouercome both the Aſiaes? <hi>Hannibal</hi> the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gian,</hi> to make ſo cruel warres againſt the Romaines? <hi>Pirrhus</hi> king of <hi>Epirotes</hi> to come downe into Italy? <hi>Atila</hi> king of the <hi>Huns</hi> to defye al <hi>Europe?</hi> truly they woulde not haue taken vppon them ſuch daungerous enterpriſes, only vppon the words of theym whych were in thoſe dayes preſent: but becauſe we ſhould ſo eſteme them that ſhould come after. Seing then that we be men, and the chyldren of men, it is not a lytle to bee marueiled at, to ſee the diuerſity betwene the one and the other, and what cowardnes ther is in the harts of ſome, and contrarywiſe what courage in the ſtomakes of others. For we ſe commonly now a daies, that if there be, 10. of ſtout courages, whych are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous with honour to dye: there are 10. thouſand cowards, whiche throughe ſhamefull pleaſurs ſeke to prolong their life. The man that is ambitious, thinketh him moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, who with much eſtimacion can kepe his renowme, and with litle care regarde his lyfe. And on the other ſide, he that wil ſet by his lyfe, ſhal haue but in ſmall eſtimacion his renowme. The <hi>Sirians,</hi> the <hi>Aſſirians,</hi> the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> the <hi>Caldes,</hi> the <hi>Grekes,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians,</hi> the <hi>Rodians,</hi> the <hi>Romaines,</hi> the <hi>Huns,</hi> the <hi>Germaines,</hi> and the Frenchmen, if ſuch noble men (as among theſe were moſt famous) had not aduentured their lyues by ſuch dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous enterpriſes, they had neuer got ſuch immortal fame as they had don to leaue to their proſperity. <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> in his third boke of the valiaunt deedes of the Romaines ſaith, that the famous captaine <hi>Marcus Marcellus</hi> (which was the firſt of al men that ſawe the backe of <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the fielde) was demaunded of one how he durſt enter into battaile, with ſuch a renoumed captaine as <hi>Hannibal</hi> was? to whom he aunſwered: frend, I am a Romaine borne, &amp; a captaine of Rome, and I muſt daylye put my lyfe in hazard for my countries ſake, for ſo I ſhal make perpetual my renoume. He was demaunded againe why he ſtroke his enemyes with ſuch fierſenes, &amp; why he did ſo pitefully lament thoſe which were ouercome, after the vyctory gotten in battaile? he aunſwered: the captaine which is a Romaine, and is not iudged to be a tiraunt, ought
<pb facs="tcp:21411:11"/>
with his owne hand to ſhed the bloud of his enemyes, and alſo to ſhed the teares of his eyes. A captayne Romaine ought more to aduaunce him of his clemencie, then of hys bluddie victory. And <hi>Marcus Marcellus</hi> ſayth further, when a Romaine captaine ſhal be in the field, he hath an eye to his enemyes with hope to vanquiſhe them, but afterl they be vanquiſſhed, he ought to remember they are men, and that he might haue bene ouercome. For fortune ſhewith herſelfe in nothinge ſo common, as in the ſucceſſes of warre. Certes theſe were words wel beſeming ſuch a man, and ſurely we may boldlye ſay, that al thoſe which ſhal heare or read ſuch thinges, wil commend the words which that Romaine ſpake: but few are they that in dede would haue done the feates that he did. For there be many that are ready to praiſe in their words that which is good: but ther are few that in their workes deſire to folow the ſame. Such harts are vnquiet, &amp; much altered by ſight and enuie that they bare towards their auncients which through manfulnes atayned vnto great tryumphes, and glory) let them remember, what daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and trauailes they paſſed through, before they came thereto. For there was neuer Captaine that euer triumphed in Rome, vnleſſe he had firſt aduentured his life a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feld I thinke I am not deceyued, in this that I wil ſay. That is to wete, al are deſirous to taſt of the marye of fame preſente: but none wil breake the bone for feare of peril enſuing Yf honour cold be bought with deſire onely, I dare boldly ſay, it would be more eſtemed in theſe dayes of the poore page: then it was in times paſt of the valyaunt Romaine <hi>Scipio.</hi> For ther is not at this day ſo poore a man, but would deſire honour aboue al thinges. What a doleful caſe is this to ſe, many gentlemen and yong knights, becom euyl diſpoſed vacabondes, and loyterers: the whych hearyng tel of any famous battaile fought, and that many of their eſtate and profeſſion haue done va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt feates in the ſame: immediately therwith be ſtirred and ſet on fire through en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies heate, ſo that in the ſame furye, they chaunge their robes into armour: and wyth al ſpede prepare them ſelues to warre, to exercyſe the feates of armes. And finally (like yong men without experience) make importunate ſute, and obtaine licence, and money of their frends to go vnto the warres. But after they are ons out of their countrey, and ſee them ſelues in a ſtraunge place, their dayes euyl, and their nightes worſe, at one tyme they are commaunded to ſkirmiſh, and at an other time to watch, when they haue vittailes, they want lodging, &amp; when the pay day cometh, that pay &amp; the next alſo is eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſpent. With theſe &amp; other like troubles &amp; diſcommodityes, the poore yong men are ſo aſtonyed: eſpecially when they cal to mind the goodly wide haules, ſo wel hanged &amp; trymmed wherin they greatly delighted to paſſe the time in ſommer ſeaſon. When they remember their greate chimneis at home, whereby they comforted their olde limmes, and how they vſed to ſit quietly vpon the ſonny bankes in winter. For the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membrauncr of the pleaſour paſt, greatly augmenteth the paines preſent. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their parents and frends, had admoniſhed them hereof before: And now being beaten with their owne folye, &amp; feling theſe diſcommodities which they thought not of before: they determyne to forſake the warres, &amp; eche one to retourne home to his owne againe. But wher as they aſked licence but ons to go forth, now they were enforced to aſke it .10. times before they could come home. And the worſt is, they went forth loden with money, and retourne home loden with vyces. But the end why theſe thinges are ſpoken is, that ſage and vertuous men ſhold marke, by what trade the euil diſpoſed ſeke to gaine: which is not gotten by gaſing at the windowes, but by keping the frountiers againſt their enemies: not with playeng at tables in the tauernes, but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fighting in the fields: not trimmed with cloth of gold or ſilkes, but loden with armoure &amp; weapons: not praunſing their palfreis, but diſcouering the ambuſhmentes: not ſleaping vntill none, but watching al night: not by auauncing him of his apparaile and handſomnes, but for his ſtout couragiouſnes: not banketing his frends, but aſſaulting his enemies: though a knight do theſe things, yet he ought to conſider that it is vanitye and foliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. But ſeing the world hath placed honour in ſuch a vaine thyng, &amp; that they can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it by none other way, the yong aduenturous gentlmen ought to employe therunto their ſtrength, with ſtout courage, to atchieue to ſome great actes worthy of
<pb facs="tcp:21411:12"/>
renowne For in the end when the warre is iuſtly begonne, and that in defence of their countrey: they ought to reioyce more of him that dieth in the hands of his enemies: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him which liueth accompanied with vices. It is a great ſhame and diſhonour to men of armes, &amp; yong gentlemen being at home, to heare the prayſe of them whych be in the warres, for the yong gentlemen ought not to thinke it honour for hym to heare or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the newes of others? but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> others ſhuld declare the vertuous dedes of him. O how many are they in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world this day puffed vp with pride, &amp; not very wiſe) which ſtil prate of great renowne, &amp; yet paſſe their life w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſmal honeſty. For our predeceſſours foughte in the field with their launces, but yong men now a dayes fight at the table with their tongues. Admit that al vaine men deſire, &amp; procure to leaue a memory of their vanity: yet they ought to enterpryſe ſuch thyngs in their life, wherby they might winne a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous renowne (&amp; not a perpetual ſhame) after their death. For ther are many departed, which haue left ſuch memory of their works as moueth vs rather to pitie their folye, than to enuy their vertue. I aſke thoſe that read or heare this thynge, if they wil be in loue wyth <hi>Nembroth</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt tiraunt: with <hi>Semiramis,</hi> which ſinned with her owne ſon: with <hi>Antenor,</hi> that betrayed <hi>Troy</hi> his countrey: with <hi>Medea,</hi> that ſlew her children: w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Tarquine</hi> that enforced <hi>Lucretia:</hi> with <hi>Brutus,</hi> that ſlew <hi>Ceſar:</hi> wyth <hi>Silla,</hi> that ſhed ſo much bloud: with <hi>Catilina,</hi> that played the tiraunt in his countrey: with <hi>Iugurtha,</hi> that ſtrangled his bretherne: with <hi>Caligula</hi> that comitted inceſt with his ſiſters: with <hi>Nero</hi> that killed his mother: wyth <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> that robbed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temples: with <hi>Domitian,</hi> that in nothing delighted ſo much, as by ſtraunge hands to put men to death, and to dryue away flies wyth his owne hands Smal is the nomber of thoſe that I haue ſpoken, in reſpect of thoſe which I could recite: of whom I dare ſay &amp; affirme, that if I had bene as they, I cannot tel what I would haue done, or what I ſhould haue deſired: but this I know, it would haue bene more paynes to me, to haue wonne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infamy that they haue wonne, then to haue loſt the lyfe that they haue loſt, It profyteth hym lytle, to haue his ponds ful of fiſh, &amp; his parkes ful of deere, whych knoweth neyther how to hunte, nor how to fyſh. I meane to ſhew by this, that it profiteth a man lytle to be in great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, if he be not eſtemed, nor honored in the ſame. For to attayne to honour, wyſedome is requiſite: &amp; to kepe it, pacience is neceſſarye. Wyth great conſyderacions wyſe men ought to enterpryſe daungerous thyngs. For I aſſure them they ſhal neuer winne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but wher they vſe to recouer ſlaunder. Returnyng therfore to our matter (Pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt prynce) I ſweare &amp; durſt vndertake, that you rather deſyre perpetual renowne through death: then any idell reſt in this life. And hereof I do not merueile, for ther are ſome that ſhal alwayes declare the proweſſes of good prynces, &amp; others which wyl not ſpare to open the vyces of euyl tiraunts. For although your imperial eſtate is much, &amp; your catholike perſon deſerueth more, yet I beleue wyth my hart, &amp; ſe with theſe eyes, that your thoughts are ſo highly bent vnto aduenturous dedes, &amp; your hart ſo coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to ſet vpon them, that your maieſtie litle eſtemeth the inheritaunce of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, in reſpect of that you hope to gaine, to leaue to your ſucceſſours. A captaine aſked <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> (as he declareth in his commentaries) why he trauailed in the winter in ſo hard froſt, &amp; in the ſommer in ſuch extreme heate, He aunſwered: I wyl do what lyeth in me to do, and afterward let the fatal deſtinies do what they can. For the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt knyght that gyueth in battayle thonſet, ought more to be eſtemed: then fickle fortune, wherby the victory is obtayned, ſins fortune gyueth the one, &amp; aduenture gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the other. Theſe words are ſpoken like a ſtout &amp; valyaunt captayne of Rome. Of how many prynces do we read, whom trulye I muche lament to ſee, what flatteries they haue herd wyth their eares being aliue: and to redde what ſlaunders they haue ſuſteyned after their death. Prynces and great lords ſhold haue more regard to that, whych is ſpoken in their abſence: then vnto that which is done in their preſence. Not to that whych they heare, but to that whych they would not heare: not to that whiche they tel them but to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they would not be told of: not to that is wryten vnto them being aliue, but to that which is wryten of them after their death: not to thoſe that tell them lyes, but to thoſe whych (if they durſt) would tel them trouth. For men manye
<pb facs="tcp:21411:12"/>
times refrayne not their tongues, for that ſubiects be not credited: but becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince in his auctority is ſuſpected. The noble &amp; vertuous prince, ſhold not flit from the trouth wherof he is certified: neyther with flateryes &amp; lyes ſhould he ſuffer himſelfe to be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but to examine himſelfe, &amp; ſe whether they ſerue him with trouth, or deceiue hym with lyes. For ther is no better witnes &amp; iudge, of truth, &amp; lyes: then is a mans owne conſcience. I haue ſpoken al this, to thintent your maieſty myght know, that I wil not ſerue you, wyth that you ſhould not be ſerued. That is, to ſhew my ſelfe in my wryting a flaterer. For it wer neither mete nor honeſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> flateries into the eares of ſuch a noble prynce ſhold enter: neither y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out of my mouth (which teach the deuine truth) ſuch vaine tales ſhould iſſue. I ſay, I had rather be diſprayſed for trew ſpeaking, then to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for flatery &amp; lieng. For of truth, in your highnes it ſhold be much lightnes to heare them, &amp; in my baſenes great wickednes to inuent them. Now againe folowing our pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſe I ſay, the hiſtoryes greatly commend <hi>Licurgus,</hi> that gaue lawes to the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians. Numa Pompilius,</hi> that honoured and adourned the churches. <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> that had pitye on thoſe whych were ouercome. <hi>Iulius Ceſar,</hi> that forgaue his enemyes. <hi>Octauius,</hi> that was ſo welbeloued of the people. <hi>Alexander,</hi> that gaue rewards and gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes to al men. <hi>Hector</hi> the <hi>Troyane,</hi> becauſe he was ſo valiaunt in warres. <hi>Hercules</hi> the <hi>Thebane,</hi> becauſe he emploied his ſtrength ſo wel. <hi>Vliſſes</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Grecian,</hi> becauſe he aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured himſelfe in ſo many daungers. <hi>Pirrhus</hi> king of <hi>Epirotes,</hi> becauſe he inuented ſo many engins <hi>Catullus Regulus,</hi> becauſe he ſuffered ſo many torments. <hi>Titus</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, becauſe he was father to the <hi>Orphanes. Traianus,</hi> becauſe he edified ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; goodly buildings. The good <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> becauſe he knew more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al they. I do not ſay that it is requiſyte for one prynce in theſe dayes, to haue in him all thoſe qualyties: but I dare be bold to affirme this, that euen as it is vnpoſſible for one prince to folow al: ſo likewiſe it is a great ſlaunder for him to folow none. We do not require princes to do al that they can, but to apply themſelues to do ſome thing that they ought And I ſpeake not without a cauſe, that whych I haue ſayd before, For if princes did oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy themſelues, as they ought to do: they ſhoulde haue no tyme to be vycious, <hi>Plynie</hi> ſaith in an epiſtle, that the great <hi>Cato,</hi> called <hi>Cenſor,</hi> did were a ring vpon his fynger, wherin was wryten theſe wordes, <hi>Eſto amicus vnius, &amp; inimicus nullius,</hi> which is, be frend to one, &amp; enemy to none. He that would depely conſider theſe few words, ſhal find therin many graue ſentences. And to apply this to my purpoſe, I ſaye, the prince that would wel gouerne his common weal: ſhew to al equal iuſtyce: deſire to poſſeſſe a quiet lyfe: to get among al a good fame: &amp; that coueteth to leaue of hymſelfe a perpetual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: ought to embrace the vertues of one, and to reiect the vices of al. I alow it verye wel that princes ſhould be equal, yea &amp; ſurmount many: but yet I aduiſe theym, not to employ their force, but to folow one. For ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times it chaunſeth, that many, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues in their life to excel al, when they are dead are ſcarcely found equal to any. Though man hath done much, &amp; blaſed what he can: yet in the ende he is but one, one mind, one power, one byrth, one life, and one death. Then ſithen he is but one, let no man preſume to know more then one. Of al theſe good princes which I haue named in the rowle of iuſtice, the laſt was <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> to thintent that he ſhould weaue his webbe. For ſuppoſe we read of many prynces that haue compyled notable things, the whych are to be redde and knowen: but al that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſayd, or dyd is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be knowen, &amp; neceſſary to be folowed. I do not meane this prynce in his heathen law, but in hys vertuous dedes. Let vs not ſtaye at hys belyef: but let vs embrace the good that he did For compare many chryſtians wyth ſome of the heathen, &amp; loke howe farre we leaue them behynd in faith: ſo farre they excel vs in vertuous works. Al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old prynces in times paſt, had ſom phyloſophers to their familiars, as <hi>Alexander, Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi> King <hi>Darius, Herodotus. Auguſtus, Piſto. Pompeius, Plauto. Titus, Plinie. Adrian, Secundus. Traian, Plutarchus. Anthonius, Apolonius. Theodotius, Claudius. Seuerus, Fabatus.</hi> Fynally I ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> philoſophers then had ſuch authority in princes palaces: that children acknowledged them for fathers and fathers reuerenced them as mayſters. Theſe ſage me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wer aliue in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of princes: but the good <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> (whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:21411:13"/>
doctrine is before your maieſtie) is not aliue, but dead. Yet therfore that is no cauſe why his doctrine ſhold not be admitted. For it may be (paraduenture) that this ſhal profit vs more, which he wrate with his hands, then that which others ſpake with their tongues. <hi>Plutarche</hi> ſayth, in the time of Alexander the great, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was aliue, and <hi>Homere</hi> was dead. But let vs ſee how he loued the one, &amp; reuerenced the other: for of truth hee ſlept alway with <hi>Homers</hi> booke in his hands, &amp; waking he red the ſame with hys eyes, &amp; alwayes kept the doctrine therof in his memory, &amp; layed (when he reſted) the booke vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der his head. The which priuiledge <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had not, who at al times cold not be heard, &amp; much leſſe at al ſeaſons be beleued: ſo that <hi>Alexander</hi> had <hi>Homere</hi> for his frend, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for a maiſter. Other of theſe phyloſophers wer but ſimple men: but our <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius,</hi> was both a wyſe phyloſopher, and a valiaunt prynce: and therfore reaſon would he ſhould be credited before others. For as a prince he wyl declare the troubles, &amp; as a phyloſopher he wil redreſſe them. Take you therefore (Puiſaunt Prince) this wiſe phyloſopher and noble emperour, for a teacher in your youth, for a father in your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, for a captayne general in your warres, for a guide in your iourneys, for a frend in your affayres, for an example in your vertues, for a maiſter in your ſciences for a pure whyte in your deſyres, and for equal matche in your deedes.</p>
                  <p>I wil declare vnto you the lyfe of an other beinge a heathen, and not the lyfe of an other being a chryſtian. For how much glory this heathen prince had in this world, being good and vertuous: ſo much paynes your maieſtie ſhal haue in the other, if you ſhalbe wicked and vycious. Behold, behold noble prince, the lyfe of this Emperour, &amp; you ſhal ſe how clere he was in his iudgement, how vpright in hys iuſtyce, howe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in hys life, how louing to his frends, how pacient in his troubles, how he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled with hys enemies, how ſeuere agaynſt Tyraunts, how quyet among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quiet, how great a frend to the ſage, and louer of the ſimple, how aduenturous in his warres, and amyable in peace, and aboue al thinges, how high in words, and profound in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. Many tymes I haue bene in doubt with my ſelfe whether the Eternal maieſty (which gyueth vnto you princes the temporal maieſtie, to rule aboue al other in power and authorytie) did exempt you that are princes, more from humaine frayltye: then he did vs that be but ſubiects: and at the laſt I knew he did not. For I ſee euen as you are chyldren of the world, ſo you do lyue according to the world. I ſee euen as you trauaile in the world: ſo you can know nothing but things of the world. I ſe becauſe you liue in the fleſhe, that you are ſubiect to the myſeryes of the fleſhe. I ſee though for a tyme you prolong your lyfe: yet at the laſt you are brought to your graue. I ſee your trauaile is great, and that within your gates there dwelleth no reſt. I ſe you are cold in the wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and hote in the ſommer. I ſe that hunger feeleth you, and thirſt troubleth you, I ſe your frendes forſake you, and your ennemyes aſſault you. I ſe that you are ſadde, and lacke ioy. I ſe you are ſicke, and be not wel ſerued. I ſee you haue muche and yet that which you lacke is more. What wil ye ſe more, ſeyng that prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the trauailer who is out of his waye, the more he goeth foreward, the more he er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethe. If the people do amiſſe, they ought to be punyſhed: but if the prince erre, hee ſhoulde bee admoniſhed, And as the Prynce wyl the people ſhoulde at his handes haue punyſhment: ſo it is reaſon that he at their hands ſhould receyue counſayle.</p>
                  <p>For as the wealthe of the one dependeth on the wealthe of the other: ſoo trulye if the prince bee vycious, the people can not be vertuous. If youre maieſtie wyl pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhe your people with words, commaund them to prynt this preſent worke in their harts. And if your people would ſerue your hyghnes with their aduiſe: let them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe beſeche you to reade ouer this booke. For therin the ſubiectes ſhal fynd how they may amende, and you Lordes ſhal ſe al that you ought to do, wdether this preſente worke be profytable, or noo, I wyll not that my penne ſhal declare: but they whyche reede it ſhall iudge.</p>

The greateſt part of al his workes were in Greke: yet he wrote alſo many in latin. I haue drawen this out of greke throughe the helpe of my frends, &amp; afterwards out of latin into our vulgare tongue by the trauaile of my hands. Let al men iudge what I haue ſuffred in drawing it out of Greke into la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, out of the latin into the vulgar, and out of a plaine vulgar, into a ſwete and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt ſtyle.

And finally, time is he that endeth al. No man can deny but the diffinition of thys Philoſopher is true: for if tyme could ſpeake, he would certifye vs of ſundry things wherin we doubt, and declare them as a wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of ſight. Admyt al things periſhe, and haue an ende: yet one thing is exempted, and neuer hath end, which is truth, that amongeſt al things is priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged in ſuch wiſe, that ſhe triumpheth of time, and not tyme of her. For accordyng to the dyuine ſayeng it ſhal be more eaſy to ſe heauen, and earth to fal: then once truth to periſh. There is nothing ſo entyer, but may be diminiſhed: nothynge ſo healthful, but may be diſeaſed: nothing ſo ſtrong, but may be broken: neyther any thing ſo wel kept, but may be corrupted. And finally I ſay, there is nothing but by time is ruled and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, ſaue only truth, which is ſubiect to none The fruits of the ſpring time haue no force to giue ſuſtenaunce, nor perfait ſwetenes to giue any ſauour, but after that the ſommer is paſt, and harueſt commeth, they rype, and then all that we eate nouriſheth more and gyueth a better taſt, I meane by this, when the world beganne to haue wyſe men, the more Philoſophers were eſtemed for their good maners, the more they deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be reproued for their euyl vnderſtandyng. <hi>Plato</hi> in his ſecond booke of the comon wealthe ſayd, that the auncient Phyloſophers) aſwell <hi>Grekes,</hi> as <hi>Egiptians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Caldees</hi>) which firſte beganne to beholde the ſtarres of heauen, and aſcended to the toppe of the mount <hi>Olimpus,</hi> to vew the influences, and mocions of the planets on the earthe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued rather pardon of their ignoraunce, then prayſe for their knowledge. <hi>Plato</hi> ſayde further, that the Phyloſophers which were before vs, were the firſt that gaue themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to ſearche out the truth of the Elements in the heauen, and the firſt whych ſowed errors in things natural of the earth. <hi>Homere</hi> in his <hi>Iliade</hi> agreyng wyth <hi>Plato,</hi> ſaith. I condemne al that the auncient Phyloſophers knew, but I greatly commend theym for that they deſired to know. Certes <hi>Homere</hi> ſayd wel, and <hi>Plato</hi> ſayd not amyſſe: for if amongeſt the firſt Philoſophers this ignoraunce had not raygned, there had not bene ſuch contrary ſectes in euery ſchoole. He that hath redde, not the bookes which are loſt, but the opinions whych the auncient phyloſophers had, wyl graunt me: thoughe the knowledge were one, yet their ſectes were dyuers: that is to ſay. <hi>Cinici, Stoici, Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mici, Platonici,</hi> and <hi>Epicurei,</hi> whych were as variable the one from the other in their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, as they were repugnaunt in their condicions.

If men would employ their knowledge to honeſty, wiſedome, pacience, and mercy, it were wel: but I am ſory they know ſo much, only for that they ſubtilly diſceiue, and by vſury abuſe their neighbours, and kepe that they haue vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gotten, and dayly getting more inuenting new trades Finally I ſay if they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knowledge, it is not to amend their life: but rather to encreaſe their goods.

I take God to witnes, who can iudge, whether my intention were good or ill to compile this worke, and alſo I ſay this my doctrine at the feete of wyſe and vertuous men, to the ende they may be protectours, &amp; defendours of the ſame. For I truſte in God, though ſome would come to blame (as dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers doe) the ſimple wordes whiche I ſpake: yet others would not faile to relate the good intention that I ment. And to declare further I ſay, that diuers haue wrytten of the tyme of the ſaid <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> as <hi>Herodian</hi> wrote litle, <hi>Eutropius</hi> leſſe, <hi>Lampri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> not ſo much, and <hi>Iulius capitolinus</hi> ſomewhat more. Likewyſe ye ought to know, that the maiſters whiche taught <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſciences, were <hi>Iunius Ruſticus, Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Catullus, Sextus Cheronenſis,</hi> whiche was nephewe to the great <hi>Plutarque.</hi> Theſe three were thoſe, that principally as witneſſes of ſight, wrate the moſt parte of his life and doctrine. Many may marueile to heare tell of the doctrine of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it hath ben kept hid and ſecret a great whyle, and that of myne owne head I haue inuented it. And that there neuer was any <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> in the worlde. I know not what to ſaye nowe vnto them, for it is euident to all thoſe whiche haue red any thyng, that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was huſbande to <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> father to <hi>Comodus,</hi> brother to <hi>Annius Verus,</hi> and ſonne in lawe to <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> the ſeuenth (of Rome) Emperour. Thoſe which ſay I onely haue made this doctrine, truly I thanke them for ſo ſaying, but not for their ſo meaning For truly, the Romaines would haue ſet my Image in Rome for perpetuall renowne, if ſo graue ſentences ſhould haue proceaded from my head. We ſee that in our tyme, which was neuer ſene before, and heare that we neuer heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. We practiſe not in a newe worlde, and yet we marueyle that there is at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a newe booke. Not for that I was curious to diſcouer <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> or ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to tranſlate him. For truly it is worthy he be noted of wyſe perſonnes, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of equious tongues.

conqueſt. As <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was brought me from Florence, ſo was this other booke of the warres of <hi>Cantabrie</hi> brought me from Colleine. If perhappes I tooke paynes to tranſlate this booke, as fewe haue done whyche haue ſene it, they woulde ſpeake the lyke of it, that they dyd of <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> Bycauſe menne are ſo long in ſpeakyng, and ſo briefe in ſtudienge, that without anye let or ſhame, they will a vowe no booke to be in the worlde this daye, but that they haue redde, or ſeen it. I haue as muche pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in this writynge, whyche is humaine: as other doctours haue done in matters, whyche are deuine. It is not tranſlated worde for worde, but ſentence for ſentence. For we other interpreters are not bounde, to gyue wordes by meaſure: but it ſuffiſeth vs, to gyue ſentencis by wayghte. I began to ſtudye this woorke in the yeare, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande, fiue hundred, and eyghtene, and vntill the yeare, a thouſande, fiue hundred, twentie and foure, I coulde neyther vnderſtand, nor knowe, wherein I was occupied. and albeit I kept it ſecreat .vi. yeres yet it was knowen abroade whervpon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour his maieſtie being with the feauer diſeaſed, ſent to me for it to paſſe the tyme away And I (according to his commaundement) ſhewed him <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> that then was vncorrected, and humbly beſeaching him ſayde: that for recompence of all my trauaile, I deſyred no other rewarde, but that no man in hys chamber myghte copye the booke. And I in the meane tyme proceded to accomplyſhe the worke, Bycauſe I did not meane in ſuche maner to publyſhe it: for otherwyſe, I ſayd hys maieſtie ſhoulde be euil ſerued, and I alſo of my purpoſe preuented: but my ſynnes cauſed, that the booke was copyed, and conueyed from one to another. And by the handes of Pages ſondrie tymes wryten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that there encreaſed dayly in it errours, and faultes. And ſynce there was but one originall copye, they brought it vnto me to correct, whiche if it coulde haue ſpoken, woulde haue complained it ſelfe, more of them that dyd wryte it: then of thoſe whyche dyd ſteale it. And thus when I hadde finyſhed the woorke, and thought to haue publyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed it, I perceaued that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was now imprinted at Ciuile. And in thys caſe, I take the readers to be iudges, betwene me and the Imprinters, becauſe they maye ſée, whether it maye ſtande with lawe, and iuſtice, that a booke whyche was to his imperiall maieſtye dedicated, the auctour thereof beyng but an infant, and the booke ſo vnparfecte and vncorrect, without my conſent or knowledge ſhoulde be publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtandynge they ceaſed not, but printed it agayne in Portugall, and alſo in the kyngdome of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> And if the fyrſte impreſſion was faultye, truly the ſeconde and the thirde were no leſſe. So that whyche was wryten for the wealthe of all men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallye, eache man dyd applye to the profite of hym ſelfe particularlye. There chaunced another thynge of this booke called the golden booke of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> whyche I am aſhamed to ſpeake, but greater ſhame they ſhoulde haue, that ſo diſhoneſtly haue done. That is, ſome made them ſelues to be auctours of the whole woorke, others ſaye that parte of it was made, and compyled of their owne heades: the whyche appeareth in a booke in print, wherein the auctour dyd lyke a man voyde of all honeſtye, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther booke, one vſed lykewyſe the words whyche <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſpake to Fauſtine, when ſhe aſked him the key of hys ſtudye. After theſe theues came to my knowledge, iudge you whether it were inoughe to proue my pacience. For I had rather they hadde robbed me of my goodes, then taken awaye my renowme. By this all men ſhal ſee, that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was not then corrected, nor in any place parfecte, wherby they myght perceaue, that it was not my minde to tranſlate <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> but to make a dial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is ſhewed for the vſe of many: ſo I woulde profite my ſelfe, with that whyche the wiſe men had ſpoken and wryten. And in this ſorte proceadeth the worke, wherin I put one, or two Chapiters of mine, and after I put ſome epiſtles of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and other doctrine of ſome auncient men. Let not the reader be diſceaued, to thynke that the one, and the other is of the auctor. For although the phraſe of the languag be mine, yet I confeſſe the greateſt part that I knew, was of another man, although the hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and doctours (with whome I was holpen) were manye: yet the doctrine whyche I
<pb facs="tcp:21411:16"/>
wrote, was but one. I will not denye, but I haue left out ſome thinges whiche were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous: in whoſe ſteade I haue placed, thinges more ſwete, and profitable. So that it neadeth good wittes, to make that whyche ſemeth in one language groſſe, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to giue it the apparaunce of golde. I haue deuided into three bookes this preſent diall of Princes. The firſt treateth, that the Prince ought to be a good chriſtian. The ſecound, howe he ought to gouerne his wife, and children. The thirde teacheth, how he ſhoulde gouerne his perſon, and his commen wealthe. I had begon another booke, wherin was conteyned, howe a Prince ſhoulde behaue him ſelfe in his courte, and pallace, but the importunitie of my frendes, cauſed me to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe my pen, to the ende I might bringe this worke to lighte.</p>

This noble prince was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally of Rome borne in the mount <hi>Celio,</hi> on the ſixt daye before the Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of May, which after the Latines accounte is the .xxvi. day of April.

But to our mater, ye ſhal vnderſtand that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes kepte a certayne Lawe in the 12. tables, the woordes wherof were theſe. We ordeyne and commaund, that al the Romaynes ſhal for euer haue ſpecyall priuiledge in euery ſuch place, where theyr aunceſtoures haue done to the Romayne people any notable ſeruice. For it is reaſon, that where the citizen aduentureth hys lyfe, there the citie ſhould do him ſome honor after hys death. By vertue of this lawe, all the familie of <hi>Camilli</hi> euer enioyed the keping of the hyghe Capitoll, for that by hys force and pollicye he chaſed the french men from the ſiege. Truely it is not vnknowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that this noble knight and valyant captayne <hi>Camille</hi> dyd other thynges as great, and greater than this: but becauſe it was done within the circuite of Rome, it was eſtemed a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boue all hys other actes and prowes. And herein the Romaynes ſwarued not farre from reaſon, for that amongeſt all princelye vertues is eſtemed to be the chiefeſt and worthyeſt, whych is employed to the profyt of the comon wealth. The Romayne Croniclers wyth teares ceaſe not to lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the ruine of their countrye, ſeynge that varietie of tyme, the multytude of tyrauntes, the crueltye of cyuill warres were occaſion that the aunciente ſtate of the Romayn gouernment came to vtter deſtruction, and in ſteede therof a new and euyl trade of lyfe to be placed. And hereof no man ought to maruaile, for it chaunſeth throughout al realmes and nacions, by oft chaunging gouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nours that among the people dayly ſpryngeth ſondry new vices. <hi>Pulio</hi> ſayth, that for no alteracion whych befell to the common weale, for no calamitye that euer Rome ſuffred, that priuiledge was taken away from the Image of <hi>Camilli</hi> (I meane the gouernment of the high Capitol) except it were in the time of <hi>Silla</hi> the conſul, when this familye was ſoore perſecuted, for none other cauſe but for that they fauoured the conſull <hi>Marius.</hi> Thys cruel <hi>Silla</hi> beinge deade, and the piteful <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> preuailinge, al the banyſhed men frome Rome returned home agayne to the commonne wealthe. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge the aunceſtours of the Emperoure <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> what hath bene their trade of lyfe, eſtate, pouertye, or riches, ſtandinge infauour or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſoure, what proſperitie or aduerſitie they haue had or ſuffred, we fynde not in wrytinges, thoughe with greate dilygence they haue bene ſerched for. And the cauſe hereof was, for that the auncient writers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaine hiſtories, touched the lyues of the emperours fathers (ſpecially, when they were made princes) more for the good merites that were in the children, then for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great eſtimacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that came from the fathers. <hi>Iulius Capitolinus</hi> ſaith
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21411:22"/>
that <hi>Annius Verus</hi> (father of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>) was <hi>Pretor</hi> of the Rhodian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and alſo wardein in other frontiers, in the time of Traian the good, Adrian the wyſe, and Antonye the mercifull. Whiche Emperours truſted none with theyr armies but diſcrete and valiaunt men. For good princes choſe alway ſuche captaines as can with wiſedome guide the armye, and with valiauntnes giue the battaile. Thoughe the Romaynes had ſondrye warres in diuerſe places, yet chefelye they kept great garriſons alwayes in foure partes of the world. That is to ſaye, in Bizance (which now is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>) to reſiſt the Parthiens, in Gades (whiche now is called Galiz) to withſtand the Portugales: in the riuer of Rein, to defend them ſelues from the Germaines: and at <hi>Coloſſes</hi> (whiche now is called the Ile of Rhodes) for to ſubdue the Barbariens. In the moneth of Ianuary when the Senate diſtributed their offices, the dictatoure being appointed for 6. monethes: and the. 2. Conſulles choſen for one yere: incontinently in the .3. place they choſe 4. of the moſt renowmed perſonnes to defende the ſayd 4, daungerous fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers. For the Romaynes neither feared the paynes of hell, nor truſted for reward in heauen: but ſought by all occaſions poſſible in their life to leaue ſome notable memory of them after their deathe. And that Romaine was counted moſt valiante &amp; of the Senate beſt fauoured, to whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the charge of the moſte cruell and daungerous warres. For their ſtrife was not to beare rule and to be in office to get mony: but to be in the frontiers to ouercome their enemies. In what eſtimacion theſe 4. frontiers wer we may eaſely perceiue, by that we ſee the moſt noble Romaines haue paſſed ſom part of their youth in thoſe places as captaines, vntill ſuch time that for more weyghtie affaires they were appointed from thenſe to ſome other places. For at that time there was no worde ſo greauous and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to a citezin, as to ſaye go, thou haſt neuer ben brought vp in the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: and to proue the ſame by examples, the great <hi>Pompey</hi> paſſed the winter ſeaſon in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the aduenturous <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Colonges,</hi> the couragious <hi>Caeſar</hi> in <hi>Gades,</hi> and the renowmed <hi>Marius</hi> in <hi>Rhodes.</hi> And theſe. 4. wer not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the frontiers afore ſayde in their youthe, but ther they dyd ſuch valiaunt actes, that the memory of them remayned euermore after their death. Theſe thynges I haue ſpoken to proue, ſythe wee fynde that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was captaine of one of thoſe .4. frontiers: it followeth that he was a man of ſinguler wiſedome and proweſſe. For as <hi>Scipio</hi> ſayde to his frende <hi>Maſiniſſa.</hi> in affrike it is not poſſible for a Romaine captayne to want eyther wiſedome or courage, for thereunto they were predeſtined at their birthe. We haue no autentike authorities that ſhoweth vs from whence, when, or howe, in what countreis and with what perſonnes this captaine paſſed his youth. And the cauſe is, for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romain Croniclers wer not accuſtomed to write the thynges done by their prince before they were created: but only the actes of yonge men, whiche from their youth had their hartes ſtoutlye bent to great aduenturs. And in my opinion it is wel done. For it is greater honor to obteine, an empire by policie &amp; wiſedom then to haue it by diſcent, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther be no tirannie. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> in his firſt boke of Emperours counteth at large the aduenturous enterpriſes taken in hand by <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in his yong age, &amp; how farre vnlikely they wer from thought that he ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:21411:23"/>
euer obtayne the Roman Empiree writing this to ſhew vnto princes, how earneſtlye <hi>Iulius Ceſars</hi> harte was bent to winne the Romayne Monarchie, and likewiſe how wiſdom fayled him in behauing him ſelfe therein. A phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher of Rome wrote to <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tiraunt, which was in <hi>Cicilia,</hi> aſking him why he poſſeſſed the Realme ſo longe by tirannye? <hi>Phalaris</hi> aunſwered hym agayne in another Epyſtle in theſe fewe wordes Thou calleſt me ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt bicauſe I haue taken this realme &amp; kept it this .32. yeres I graunt the (quod he) that I was a tiraunte in vſurpyng it: For no manne occupyeth another mannes ryght but by reaſon he is a tyraunte. But yet I will not agree to be called a tyraunte, ſithe it is nowe .xxxii. yeares ſins I haue poſſeſſed it. And though I haue atcheued it by tyrannie, yet I haue gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it by wiſedome. And I let thee to vnderſtande, that to take an other mans goods, it is an eaſie thing to conquer, but a hard thing to kepe an eaſy thing: but to kepe them, I enſure the it is very hard. The Emperour <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Aurelius</hi> maried the doughter of <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> the 16. Emperour of Rome, and ſhe was named <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> who as ſole heire had the Empire: &amp; ſo through mariage <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> came to be Emperour: this <hi>Fauſtine</hi> was not ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and chaſt: as ſhe was faire and beautifull. She had by him two ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>Commodus,</hi> and <hi>Verisſimus, Marcus Aurelius</hi> triumphed twiſe, once when he ouercame the <hi>Perthians,</hi> and an other time when he conquered the <hi>Argonantes</hi> He was a man very wel learned and of a deepe vnderſtanding, He was as excellent both in the Greke and latin, as he was in his mother tongue. He was very temperate in eating and drinking, he wrote many thinges ful of good learning &amp; ſwete ſentences: He dyed in conquering the realme of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi> whiche is now called Hongarie. His death was aſmuch bewayled, as his lyfe was deſired. And he was loued ſo intierlye in the citye of Rome, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery Romane had a ſtatue of him in his houſe, to thende the memorie of him (among them) ſhould neuer decay. The which was neuer red that they euer did for any other king or Emperoure of Rome, no not for <hi>Auguſtus Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> who was beſte beloued of all other Emperours of Rome. He gouerned the empire for the ſpace of 18. yeres with vprighte iuſtice: and dyed at the age of 63 yeres with much honour, in the yere clymatericke, which is in the 60. and 3. yeres wherein the lyfe of man ronneth in great peril. For then are accomplyſhed the nine ſeuens, or the ſeuen nynes. <hi>Aulus Gelius</hi> writeth a cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>piter of this matter in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boke <hi>De noctibus Atticis. Marcus Aurelius</hi> was a prince of lyfe moſt pure, of doctrine moſt profound, &amp; of fortune moſt happie of all other princes in the world, ſaue only for <hi>Fauſtine</hi> his wife and <hi>Commodus</hi> his ſonne And to the ende we maye ſee what <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was from his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, I haue put here an epiſtle of his which is this.</p>

vnto me, which was writen long before, and greatly deſired of me: but the beſt therof is, that thou wryting vnto me briefly, deſireſt that I ſhould writ vnto the at large. Which is vndecent for the authoritie of him that is chiefe of the empire, in eſpecial if ſuch one be couetous: for to a prince there is no greater infamy, then to be lauiſhe of words, and ſcant of rewards. Thou wryteſt to me of thy griefe in thy legge, and that thy wounde is great: and truly the payne thereof troubleth me at my hart, and I am righte ſory that thou wanteſt that which is neceſſarie for thy health, and that good that I do wiſhe the. For in the ende all the trauailes of the life may be endured, ſo that the body with diſeaſes be not troubled. Thou letteſt me vnderſtande by thy letters that thou art arriued at Rhodes, and requireſte me to write vnto the howe I lyued in that place when I was younge, what time I gaue my minde to ſtudie, &amp; likewiſe what the diſcourſe of my life was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the time of my being Emperoure of Rome. In this caſe trulye I meruell at the not a lytle that thou ſhouldeſt aſke me ſuch a queſtion, and ſo muche the more that thou diddeſt not conſider, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I cannot without great trouble and paine anſwere thy demaunde. For the doinges of youthe in a younge man were neuer ſo vpright and honeſt, but it were more honeſty to amend them, then to declare them. <hi>Annius Verus</hi> my father ſhewing vnto me his fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therly loue (not accompliſhing yet fully 13 yeres) drew me from the vices of Rome, and ſent me to Rhodes to learne ſcience, howbeit better acccompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed with bookes, then loden with money, where I vſed ſuche dilygence, and fortune ſo fauoured me, that at the age of 26. yeres I red openly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and moral philoſophy, and alſo Rethoricke: and ther was nothing gaue me ſuch occaſion to ſtudy, and read bookes, as the want of moneye, for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie cauſeth good mens children to bee vertuous, ſo that they attaine to that by vertue, which others come vnto by riches. Trulye frende <hi>Pulio</hi> I found great want of the pleaſures of Rome, ſpecially at my firſt comminge into the Ile, but after I had redde philoſophie 10 yeares at Rhodes, I toke my ſelfe as one borne in the countrey, And I thinke my couerſacion among them cauſed it to ſeme no leſſe. For it is a rule that neuer faileth, that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue maketh a ſtraunger grow natural in a ſtraunge country: and vyce ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the natural a ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger in his owne country. Thou knoweſt wel how my father <hi>Annius Verus</hi> was 15. yeres a captaine in the frontiers againſt the Barbarous, by the commaundement of Adrian my lorde and maiſter, and <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> my father in law, both of theym prynces of famous memorie: which reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended me ther to his old frendes, who with fatherly counſel ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>horted me to forget the vyces of Rome, and to accuſtome me to the vertues of Rhodes. And trulye it was but nedeful for me, for the naturall loue of the countrye oft tymes bringeth domage to him that is borne therein leadinge his deſier ſtil to retourne home. Thou ſhalt vnderſtand that the Rhodians are men of much curteſy, &amp; requyting beneuolence, whych chaunſeth in few Iles: becauſe that naturally they are perſonnes deceitful, ſubtile, vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ful of ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I ſpeake this bycauſe my fathers frends alwaies ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured me wyth counſayle and money: which two thinges were ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie, that I could not tell which of them I had moſt nede of. For the ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger maketh his profit with moneye to withſtand diſdainfull pouertie, and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:24"/>
profitteth him ſelfe with counſell to forget the ſwete loue of his country. I deſired then to reade philoſophy in Rhodes ſo long as my father continued there captaine, But that could not be, for Adrian my lord ſent for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to Rome, which pleaſed me not a lytle, albeit (as I haue ſaid) they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me as if I had ben borne in that Iland, for in theend although the eyes be fedde with delyght to ſee ſtraunge thinges, yet therefore the hart is not ſatiſfyed. And this is al that toucheth the Rhodians. I will now tel the alſo how before my going thether I was borne and brought vp in mount <hi>Celio</hi> (in Rome) with my father from mine infancie. In the common wealthe of Rome ther was a law vſed, &amp; by cuſtome wel obſerued, that no citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which enioyed any lybertie of Rome (after their ſonnes had accomplyſhed .10. yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res) ſhould be ſo bold or hardy to ſuffer them to walke the ſtreates like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabondes. For it was a cuſtome in Rome, that the chyldren of the ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours ſhould ſucke til two yeres of age, til 4. they ſhould liue at theyr own wylles, tyl 6. they ſhould reede, tyl 8 they ſhould wryte, tyll 10. they ſhould ſtudy gramer, &amp; 10. yeares accompliſhed they ſhould then take ſome craft or occupacion, or gyue them ſelues to ſtudy, or go to the warres, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Rome no man was idell. In one of the lawes of the 12 tables weare written theſe wordes. We ordeine and commaund that euery cytizen that dwelleth wythin the circuite of Rome or lybertyes of the ſame, from 10 ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res vpwardes to kepe hys ſonne well ordered. And if perchaunce the chyld being ydel, or that no man teacheth hym any craft or ſcyence, ſhould therby peraduenture fal to vyce, or commyt ſome wycked offence, that then the fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther no leſſe then the ſonne ſhould be punyſhed. For ther is nothing ſo much breadeth vyce amongeſt the people, as when the fathers are to neclygent, and the chyldren to bold. And furthermore another law ſayd. We ordeine and commaunde that after 10. yeares be paſt, for the fyrſt offence that the chyld ſhal commyt in Rome, that the father ſhalbe bound to ſend hym forth ſome where els, or to be bound ſuertye for the good demeanour of hys ſon. For it is not reaſon that the fonde loue of the father to the ſonne ſhould be an occaſion why the multytude ſhuld be ſclaundered: becauſe al the wealth of the Empyre conſiſteth in kepyng and mayntaynyng quyet men, and in baniſhyng and expellyng ſedycious perſonnes. I wyll tell the one thyng my <hi>Pulyo,</hi> and I am ſure thou wylt meruell at it, and it is thys. When Rome tryumphed and by good wyſedom gouerned all the worlde, the inhabitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in the ſame ſurmounted the nomber of two hundreth thouſand parſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which was a maruelouſe matter. Amongeſte whom (as a man maye iudge) ther was aboue a hundreth thouſand chyldren. But they whych had the charge of them kept them in ſuch awe and doctryne, that they banyſhed from Rome one of the ſonnes of <hi>Cato vticenſis</hi> for breakyng an erthen pot in a maydens handes whych went to fetche water. In lyke manner they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed the ſonne of good <hi>Cinna,</hi> onlye for entrynge into a garden to gather fruyte, And none of theſe two were as yet fyftyne yeares olde. For at that tyme they chaſtiſed them more for the offences done in geſt, then they doo now for thoſe which are don in good earneſt. Our <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith in his booke <hi>De legibus,</hi> that the Romaynes neuer toke in any thing more paynes, then to reſtreine the chyldren aſwel old as young from ydlenes. And ſo long endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21411:24"/>
the feare of their lawe, and honour of theyr common wealthe, as they ſuffered not their children lyke vacabondes idelly to wander the ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. For that countrey may aboue all other be counted happye, where eche one enioyeth hys owne laboure, and no man lyueth by the ſwette of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I let the know my <hi>Pulio,</hi> that when I was a chylde (althoughe I am not yet very olde) none durſte be ſo hardy to go commonly throughe Rome, wythout a token about hym of the crafte and occupacion he exercyſed, and whereby he lyued. And if anye man had bene taken contrary, the chyldren dyd not onlye crie out of hym in the ſtreates as of a foole: but alſo the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour afterwardes condemned hym to trauayle wyth the captynes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon workes. For in Rome they eſtemed it no leſſe ſhame to the child which was idle, then they dyd in <hi>Grece</hi> to the phyloſopher whych was ignorant. And to thende thou mayeſt ſe thys I write vnto the to be no new thynge, thou oughteſt to know, that the Emperour cauſed to be borne afore hym a brenning brand, and the counſel an axe of armes, the prieſtes a hat in maner of a coyfe, The Senatours a cruſible on their armes, the Iudges a lytle ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, the Tribunes Maces, the gouernours a ſcepter, the Byſhoppes hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of floures, The Oratours a booke, the cutlers a ſwerd, the goldſmithes a pot to melt gold: and ſo forth of al other offices, ſtrangers excepted, which went al marked after one ſort in Rome: For they woulde not agree that a ſtranger ſhoulde be apparailed &amp; marked according to the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rome. O my frend <hi>Pulio,</hi> it was ſuche a ioye then to beholde the diſcipline and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie of Rome, and it is now at this preſent ſuche a grefe to ſee the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie thereof, that by the immortall gods I ſweare to the, and ſo the god Mars guyde my hande in warres, that the man which now is beſt orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is not worthe ſo much as the moſt diſſolute perſon was then. For then amongeſt a thouſande they could not finde one man vicious in Rome, and nowe amonges twentie thouſande they cannot finde one vertuous in all Italye. I know not why the gods are ſo cruel againſte me, and fortune ſo contrary, that this 40. yeares I haue done nothynge but wepe and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente to ſee the good men die, and immediatly to be forgotten: and on the other ſide to ſee the wicked liue and to be alwayes in proſperitye. Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallye the noble harte maye endure al the troubles of mans life, vnleſſe it be to ſee a good man decay, and the wicked to proſper: which my harte cannot abyde, nor yet my tonge diſſemble. And touchynge this matter my frende <hi>Pulio,</hi> I will write vnto the one thynge whiche I founde in the bookes of the highe Capitoll, where he treateth of the time of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> whiche trulye is worthy of memorye and that is this. There was at Rome a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome and a lawe inuiolable, ſith the time of <hi>Cinna,</hi> that a Cenſour expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commaunded by the ſenate ſhould goe and viſite the prouinces whyche were ſubiecte vnto it throughe out all Italye: and the cauſe of thoſe viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions was for three thinges. The firſte, to ſee if any complained of iuſtice, the ſecond, to ſee in what caſe the common wealthe ſtode. The thirde, to thende that yearelye they ſhould render obedience to Rome. O my frende <hi>Pulio,</hi> how thinkeſt thou? if they viſited Italye at this preſente, as at that time they ſurueyed Rome, how ful of errous ſhould they fynd it: And what decaye ſhoulde they ſee therein thinkeſt thou? Trulye (as thou knoweſt) they
<pb facs="tcp:21411:25"/>
ſhould ſee the common wealthe deſtroyed, iuſtice not miniſted, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer Rome not obeyed, and not without iuſte cauſe. For of righte oughte that common wealthe to be diſtroyed, which ons of al other hath bene the flower, and moſt beautified with vertues: and after becommeth moſte ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable and defiled with vices. The caſe was ſuche, that two yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the warres of <hi>Sylla,</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> the Cenſor went yearely to <hi>Nola</hi> (whiche is a place in the prouince of <hi>Campania</hi>) to viſite the ſame countrey as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was. And in thoſe dayes the tyme and ſeaſon being verye hote, and the prouince quiet, not dyſturbed with warres, and perceiuyng that none of the people cam to him. The cenſour ſayde to the hoſte which lodged hym.</p>
                     <p>Frend I am a iudge ſent from the Senatours of Rome to viſite this land. Therefore goe thy wayes quicklye and call the good men hither whiche be amonge the people, For I haue to ſaye vnto theym from the ſacred ſenate. This hoſte (who peraduenture was wyſer then the Romayne iudge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughe not ſo ryche) goeth to the graues of the dead, whiche in that place were buryed, and ſpake vnto them with a loude voyce ſayinge. O ye good men, come awaye with me quickelie, for the Romayne Cenſour calleth you. The iudge perceiuyng they came not, ſent hym agayne to cal them: and the hoſt as he dyd at the firſt tyme, ſo dyd he nowe at the ſeconde. For when he was at the graues with a loud voyce he ſaid. O ye good men come hither, for the cenſour of Rome woulde talke with you. And lykewyſe they were called the third tyme, with the ſelfſame wordes. And the Cenſour ſeyng no body come, was maruelous angrie, and ſaid to the hoſte. Sithe theſe good men dyſdayne to come at my commandement, and ſhewe their allegiaunce to the ſacred ſenate of Rome (to thintente I maye punyſhe this their dyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience) I wil goe vnto them my ſelfe, Come and go with me. The poore hoſte without any wordes, takyng the cenſour by the hand, led him to the graues where he had ben before, and agayne with a loude voice cried vnto the dead men and ſayed. O ye good men, here is the Roman cenſor come to ſpeake with you. The cenſor beyng angry ſayde to hym, what meaneſt thou by this hoſt? I ſent the to cal them that are aliue, &amp; not thoſe that are dead? the hoſt made anſwer: o thou Roman Iudge if thou wert wyſe, thou wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not marueil at that that I haue done. For I let the vnderſtand, in this our citie of <hi>Nola</hi> al the good men, (all I ſay) are now deade, and lye here bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in theſe graues, Therfore thou haſt no cauſe to marueile, nor yet to be dyſpleaſed with my anſwere: but I rather ought to be offended with thy demaunde, willyng me to enquire for good menne, and thou thy ſelfe doſte offende with the euill dailie. Wherfore I let the know (if thou be ignoraunt therof) if thou wilt ſpeake with any good man, thou ſhalte not finde him in all the hole worlde: vnles the dead be reuiued, or excepte the gods wil make a newe creation. The Conſul <hi>Sylla</hi> was fyue monethes our captain in this oure citye of <hi>Nola</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> ſowinge the fruite whiche ye other Romai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes gathered: that is to ſay, he lefte children without fathers, fathers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out children, daughters without mothers, and huſbandes without wyues: wiues without huſbandes, vncles without nephewes, ſubiectes withoute Lordes, Lordes withoute tenauntes, gods without Temples, Temples without prieſtes, mountaines without heardes, and fieldes without fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21411:25"/>
And the worſte of all is, that this curſed <hi>Sylla,</hi> diſpeopled this oure citye of good and vertuous men: and replenyſhed it with wycked and vitious perſonnes Ruine and decay neuer deſtroyed the walles ſo muche, neyther the mothes euer marred ſo many garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, ne the wormes rotted ſo much fruites, nor yet the hayle beate downe ſo muche corne, as the diſorder and vices of <hi>Sylla</hi> the Romaine <hi>Conſul</hi> dyd harme, whiche he broughte vnto this land of campania. And although the euils that he did here to the men were many folde greate, yet muche greater herein was that which he did to their cuſtomes and maners. For in the ende, the good men whiche he behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded are now at reſt with the dead: but the vices whiche he left vs. In this land ther are none but proude &amp; arrogant men that deſire to commaunde. In this land there are none other but enuious men that know nought els but malice. In this land there are idle men which doe nothing but loſe their tyme. In thys land there are none but gluttons, whych doe nothyng but eateth. In this land ther are non but theues, which entende nought els but robberies. In thys lande there are none but rebelles, that doe nothyng but ſtirre ſedicion. And if thou and al the Romaynes eſteme theſe men for good, tary a while I wyl goe to cal them al to the. For if we ſhould kil and put in the ſhambles al the yll men and wey theym as we doe the fleſh of ſhepe, or other lyke beaſtes: all the neighbours and inhabitantes of Italye ſhoulde haue meate ſufficiente to eate. Beholde <hi>Cenſor,</hi> in this lande of Campania they caſe none good but thoſe which are quyet, ſober, wiſe, and diſcret men. Thei cal none good but the pacient, honeſt, and verteous men. Finallie I ſay that we cal none good but thoſe which wyll doe no harme, and will occupy them ſelues in good workes without teares. I ſpeke not that whych I wil ſay, that is: if we ſeke for any of them we ſhal finde none but in theſe graues. For the iuſte iudgment of god it was, they ſhould repoſe them ſelues in the intrailles of the earthe, whom the publike weale deſerued not to haue alyue Thou comeſt to viſite thys land where thou ſhalt imediatly be ſerued with the wycked: and to hyde theyr faultes, theyr diſſolute lyfe, and theyr vices, thou ſhalt not be a little ſolicited. Beliue me if thou wilt not vndoe thy ſelf &amp; be deceiued. Truſt thou rather theſe rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bones, then their deceiptful harts. For in the end, the examples of the dead that were good doe profyte men more to lyue well: than the counſaile of the liuing that be wicked doe interre and burye al thoſe that be nowe lyuyng.</p>

vertues. <hi>Annius Verus</hi> my father in thys caſe deſerueth as much prayſe, as I doe reproche. For whiles I was yonge, he neuer ſuffered me to ſlepe in bed, to ſyt in chayre, to eate with him at hys table, neyther durſt I lyfte vp mine eyes to loke hym in the face. And oftentymes he ſayde vnto me, <hi>Marcus</hi> my ſonne, I had rather thou ſhoudeſt be an honeſt Romayne, than a diſſolute Philoſopher. Thou deſyreſt me to wryte vnto the how manye maſters I had, and what ſcyences I learned in my youth. Knowe thou that I had manye good maſters, though I am become an euyll ſcoller. I learned alſo dyuerſe ſcyences, though preſently I knowe lyttle, not for that I forgote them, but becauſe the affayres of the empyre of Rome excluded me from them, and cauſed me to forſake them. For it is a general rule, that ſcience in that place is neuer permanent, where the perſonne is not at libertie. I ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed grammer with a mayſter called <hi>Euphermon,</hi> who ſayed he was a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard borne, and his head was hore for age. In ſpeache he was very tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, in correction ſomwhat ſeuere, and in life exceadyng honeſte. For there was a law in Rome, that the childrens maſters ſhould be very old: ſo that if the diſciple were .10. yeres of age, the maſter ſhould be aboue fiftie. I ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died a long time Rethorick, and the lawe, vnder a greeke called <hi>Alexander,</hi> borne in <hi>Lycaony,</hi> which was ſo excellent an Oratour, that if he had had as great a grace in writing with his pen, as he hadde eloquence in ſpeakynge with hys tong, truly he had bene no leſſe renowmed among the Gretians, then <hi>Cicero</hi> was honored amonge the Romains. After the death of this my maſter (at Naples) I went to Rhodes, and hearde rethoricke again of <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> of <hi>Pharanton,</hi> and of <hi>Pulio,</hi> whiche trulye were men expert, and excellent in the arte of oratorie, and eſpecially in makyng comedies, tragedies, and enterludes, they were very fyne, and had a goodly grace. <hi>Commodus Calcedon,</hi> was my firſte maſter in naturall Philoſophie. He was a graue man, and in greate credite with <hi>Adrian,</hi> he tranſlated Homere out of greeke into latin. After this man was dead, I toke <hi>Sextus Cherone<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſis</hi> for my maſter, who was nephewe to Plutarche the greate, whych Plutarche was <hi>Traianus</hi> maſter, I knewe this <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> at .35. yeares of age, at what time I doute whether there hath bene any Philoſopher that euer was ſo well eſtemed throughout the Romain empire as he. I haue him here with me, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be foure ſcore yeres olde, yet continually he writeth the Hiſtories and geſtes done of my time. I let the know, my frend <hi>Pulio,</hi> that I ſtudied the law .2. yeres, and the ſeekyng of the lawes of many nacions was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that I knew many antiquities: and in this ſcience <hi>Volucius Mecianns</hi> was my maſter, a man whiche could reade it well, and alſo diſpute of if bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that on a time he demaunded of me merily and ſayde. Tell me Marke, doeſt thou thinke there is any lawe in the world that I know not? and I aunſwered him: Tell me maſter, is there any lawe in the world that thou obſerueſt? The fyfte yere that I was at Rhodes there came a maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous peſtilence, whiche was occaſion of the diſſolution of our ſcoole, which was in a narowe and litle place, and beynge there a certaine painter pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge a riche and exellent worke for the Realme of Paleſtine, I then for a truth learned there to drawe and painte, and my maſter was <hi>Diogenetus,</hi> who in thoſe dayes was a famous painter. He painted in Rome .6. worthy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21411:26"/>
Princes in one table, and 6. other tirannous Emperours in an other. And amongeſt thoſe euill <hi>Nero</hi> the cruell was painted ſo lyuely, that he ſemed a lyue to all thoſe that ſawe him: and that table wherein <hi>Nero</hi> was ſo liuelye drawen, was by decrees of the ſacred ſenat commaunded to be burnt. For they ſaide that a man of ſo wycked a life, deſerued not to be repreſented in ſo goodly a table. Others ſaide that it was ſo naturall and perfect, that he made all men afrayde that beheld him, and if he had bene lefte there a fewe daies, that he would haue ſpoken as if he had bene aliue. I ſtudied the arte of Nigromancie a while with al the kyndes of gyromancye and chiroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye. In this ſcience I had no particuler maſter, but that ſomtymes I went to heare <hi>Apolonius</hi> lecture. After I was maried to <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> I learned Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mographye in the citie of <hi>Argeleta,</hi> which is the chiefeſte towne of <hi>Illyria:</hi> and my maſters were <hi>Iunius Ruſticus,</hi> and <hi>Cyna Catullus,</hi> Croniclers and counſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to <hi>Adrian</hi> my maſter, and <hi>Antonius</hi> my father in lawe. And becauſe I would not be ignorant in any of thoſe thynges that mans debilitie myght attaine to, beyng at the warres of <hi>Dalia</hi> I gaue my ſelfe to muſicke, &amp; was apte to take it, and my maſter was named <hi>Geminus C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was the order of my lyfe, and the tyme that I ſpente in learning. And of good reaſon a man ſo occupyed can not choſe but be vertuous. But I ſware and confeſſe to the that I did not ſo much geue my ſelfe to ſtudye, but that euery day I loſt time enoughe. For youth and the tender fleſhe deſyreth libertie, and althoughe a man accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome it with trauailes, yet he findeth vacant time alſo for his pleaſours. Although al the auncient Romans were in dyuerſe thinges very ſtudious, yet notwithſtandinge amongeſt all ouer and beſides theſe, there were fyue things wherunto they had euer a great reſpect: &amp; to thoſe that therin offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, neyther requeſtes auayled, rewards profited, nor law (old nor new) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed. Truly their good willes are to be comended, and their dyligence to be exalted. For the princes that gouerne great Realmes, ought to employe their hartes to make good lawes, and to occupie their eyes to ſe them du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye executed throughoute the common wealthe.

                     <p n="1">1 The firſte, they ordeyned that the prieſtes ſhoulde not be diſhoneſte. For in that Realme where prieſtes are dyſhoneſt, it is a token that the gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the people are angrye.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The ſeconde, it was not ſuffered in Rome that the Virginnes veſtalles ſhould at their pleaſoure ſtray abroad.

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:27"/>The fifthe was, that they whiche had charge of bringinge vp of children ſhoulde not be vicious. For there is nothinge more monſtruous and more ſclaunderous, then he that is maiſter of children, ſhould be ſubiecte and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt to vyces. How thinkeſt thou my frende <hi>Pulio</hi> whan al theſe thinges were obſerued in Rome? Thinkeſt thou that the youthe was ſo diſſolute as at this preſent? thinkeſte thou in deede that it is the ſame Rome wherin (in times paſt) were ſo notable good and auncient men? beleueſt thou that it is that Rome wherin (in the golden age) the olde men were ſo honeſt, and the children ſo well taught, the armies wel ordered, and the iudges and Sena<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tours ſo vpright and iuſte? I call God to witnes, and ſweare to the that it is not Rome, neyther hath it any likenes of Rome, nor yet anye grace to be Rome: and he that would ſay that this Rome was the old Rome, knoweth lytle of Rome. The matter was this, that the auncient and vertuous Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes being dead, it ſemeth to the gods, that we are not yet woorthye to enioye their houſes, So that eyther this is not Rome, or els we be not the Romaines of Rome. For conſidering the proweſſe and vertuous deedes of the auncient Romaines, and wayeng alſo our diſſolute lyues: it wer a very great infamy for them, to call vs their ſucceſſours. I deſier my frend <hi>Pulio,</hi> to write vnto the all theſe thinges, to thend thou mayeſt ſe what we were, and what we are. For great things haue neede of great power, and require a long tyme before they can growe and come to their perfection: and then afterward at one moment &amp; with one blow they fal downe to the ground.

That they ſtriued often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times amongeſt them ſelues, not ſo muche vpon the poſſeſſions and ſigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Realmes, as vppon a certaine obſtinacie they had to maintaine the gods of the one, to be of greater power then the others. For they thoughte if their gods were not eſtemed, that the people ſhould be impoueriſhed, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, and perſecuted. <hi>Pulio</hi> in his ſecond booke <hi>De diſſolatione regionum orientarum,</hi> declareth that the firſt prouince that rebelled againſte the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Helius Adrianus</hi> (which was the fiftenth Emperour of Rome) was the land of Paleſtine, againſt the which was ſent a captaine named <hi>Iulius Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:28"/>
a manne of great courage and verye fortunate and aduenturous in armes. This captaine did not only finiſhe the warres, but he wrought ſuch an outragious deſtruction in that land, that he beſieged 52. cities and raced them to the ground, and burned 680. villages, and ſlew ſo many in battaile ſchermidge, and by Iuſtice, that amounted to the nombre of .5000. perſons. For vnto the prowde and cruell captaines victory can neuer be glorious, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they water the ground with the bludde of their enemies. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in the cities and townes beſieged, the children olde men and women whiche died throughe hunger and peſtilence were more in nombre, than thoſe whiche were ſlain in the warres. For in warres the ſworde of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies lighteth not vpon all: but peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and famine hath no reſpecte to any. After this warre of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Paleſtines was ended, immediatly after aroſe a more crueller betwixte the <hi>Allaynes,</hi> and <hi>Armenians.</hi> For there are many that ſe the beginninge of the troubles and miſeries which aryſe in Realmes: but there are fewe that conſider the ende, and ſeke to remedye the ſame. The occaſion of this warre was, as they came to the feaſt of the mount <hi>Olimpus</hi> they fell in diſputacions whither of their gods were better, &amp; whiche of them ought to bee preferred before other. Whereof there ſprange ſuche contradictions, and ſuche mortall hatred, that on euerye parte they were furiouſlye moued to warres: and ſo vnder a colour to mainteine the gods which they honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, both the common wealthes were brought into great pouertie, and the people alſo into muche miſerie. The Emperoure <hi>Helius Adrianus,</hi> ſeyng ſuche cruell warres to aryſe vppon ſo lyghte occaſion, ſente thither the captayne aboue named, <hi>Iulius Seuerus,</hi> to pacifye the Allaines and <hi>Armenians,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded hym that he ſhould perſecute thoſe with warres, whiche woulde not be ruled by his arbitrement and ſentence. For thoſe iuſtlye deſerue the ſworde, which with no reaſonable condicions wil condeſcende vnto peace. But <hi>Iulius Seuerus</hi> vſed ſuche pollicye that he made them good frendes, and neuer touched them nor came nere them. Whyche thynge was no leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Emperour, then profitable to the realmes. For the captayne whyche ſubdueth the countrey by entreatye, deſerueth more honoure, then he which ouercommeth it by bataile. The agrement of the peace was made vpon ſuche condicion, that the <hi>Allayns</hi> ſhould take for their gods the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> gods, and the <hi>Armenians</hi> on the contrarye the gods of the <hi>Allains:</hi> and further when the people ſhould imbrace and reconcile them ſelues to the ſenate, that then the gods ſhould kyſſe the one the other, and to be reconciled to the temple. The vanitie of the auncientes was ſuche, and the blindnes of mortall men ſo greate, and ſo ſubiect were they to deuilliſhe deuiſes, that as eaſely as the eternall wiſedom createth a true man now a dayes: ſo eaſelye then a vaine man might haue inuented a falſe god. For the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had this opinion, that men had no leſſe power to inuent goddes, then the gods had to create menne.</p>

For regarding to how many profitable things we employ our life, we maye ſay, we liue onlye the time which is employed to the ſeruice of god. Ceaſinge to ſpeake further of my perſon, I wil (worthy Senatours) diſcloſe vnto you a high ſecret, which toucheth your comon welth, &amp; this it is. That our father <hi>Romulus</hi> founded Rome, <hi>Numa Pompillius</hi> erected the high Capitol, <hi>Aneus Marcius</hi> encloſed it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> walles, <hi>Brutus</hi> deliuered it from Tyraunts: the good <hi>Camillus</hi> droue out the frenchmen <hi>Quintus Scicinnatus</hi> augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted her power: but I leaue it peopled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gods, which ſhal defend Rome better then walles or men. For in the end, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare of one god is more worth, then the ſtrength of al men. When I came to Rome it was a confuſion to ſe how it was peopled with men, &amp; vnfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of gods. For ther wer but 5. gods, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to wete, <hi>Iupiter, Mars, Ianus, Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthia,</hi> and the goddeſſ <hi>Veſta.</hi> But now it is not ſo. For ther remayneth for euery one a priuate god. Me thinketh it an vniuſt thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> treaſouries ſhold be ful of gold, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temples void of gods. As ther is 28000 houſholdes, ſo you may account your ſelues happie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I leaue you 28000. gods: by the vertu of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iure you Romains, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eche of you be contented with the god of his houſe, and haue no care to applye to himſelfe the gods of the common wealth. For he that empropreth to him ſelf that which ought to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to al, is to be blamed of god, and hated of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This ſhalbe therfore the order that you ſhal kepe and haue towards the gods, if you wil not erre in their ſeruice. That is to vnderſtand, ye ſhal kepe the mother <hi>Berecinthia,</hi> to pacify y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ire of the gods, ye ſhal kepe the goddeſſe <hi>Veſta,</hi> to turne from you the wicked deſtenies. Ye ſhal kepe the god <hi>Iupiter,</hi> &amp; ſhal commit vnto him the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your common wealth.

But the deuine prouidence which geueth no place to humayne malice to execute his forces, before the walles were repaired, and before the meſſaungers broughte aunſweare, and before the ſtraunge gods coulde enter into Rome, <hi>Randagagiſmus,</hi> king of the Gothes, with 2000000. of barbarous (without the effuſion of Chriſtian bloud) ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainlye in the mountaynes of <hi>Veſulanes,</hi> wythe famyne, thirſte, and ſtones which fell from heauen, loſte all his armye, not one left alyue but himſelfe, whoe had hys heade ſtrycken of in Rome.

                        <hi>O</hi> Groſſe ignoraunce, and vnſpekeable obſtinacy. O Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God inſcrutable. What thinke theſe gentyles by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true god? They ſearched the falſe gods to helpe them, &amp; had a lyuing god of their owne: they ſought gods ful of gyle and diſceyte, and worſe then that, they thought it neceſſary y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that God, which created al things ſhould be accompanyed with their gods to defend them which could make nothinge. Let now all theyr gods come forth into the fyeldes on the one ſyde, and I will go forthe alone in godlye company, that is to ſay with the hygh god on thother parte. And we wyll compare the deades and proue the aydes of their falſe God, againſt &amp; wyth the leaſt worke of our true god. And they ſhall clearelye perceiue their falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode and our truth. For the tongue that ſpeaketh of God can neuer beare with any lye, and that whiche ſpeaketh of Idolles can neuer dyſcloſe anye truth. Yf they eſteme him much for creatinge the world with his might: is it any leſſe to preſerue and gouerne it by his wiſedome? For many thinges are done in a moment, for the preſeruacion wherof long tyme is requyſyte, and much paynfull trauaile neceſſarye. I demaunde further what God of the gentyles could do that whych our God hath done? that is to knowe, within one <hi>Arcke</hi> to make quyet the Lion with the leoperd, the wolfe with the lambe, the Beare with the Cow, the Tigar with the Cocodryll, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned horſe with the Mare, the Dogge with the Catte, the foxe with the Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the houndes with the hares, and ſo of other beaſtes: whoſe enmytye is greater thone agaynſt other, then that of man is againſt men. For thenmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges men proceadeth of malice, but that of beaſts procedeth of nature. Alſo I demaunde what God (if it wer not the true God ſo mightye) could ſley and drowne in one hower and moment ſo many men women, &amp; bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes: ſo that al thoſe which were in the world (eight only excepted) perriſſhed in the deluge of Noy. The iudgement of god by ordynaunce, &amp; their offences
<pb facs="tcp:21411:31"/>
deſerued this ſo maruelous a domage. For god neuer executed any notable puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but firſt it came through our wicked offences. And if this be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted for a greate thynge, I wyll that another thing be had in great eſtyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Which is, that if god ſhewed his rygorous iuſtice in this puniſhment, incontinently he ſhewed his might &amp; clemency in remedyeng it, in that of theſe eyght perſons (which were but few) the generacion dyd multiplye in ſo great a nomber that they dyd replenyſh many and great Realmes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on a man ought to marueil, for according as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, the great thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are eaſely put to deſtruction and brought to noughte, but with greate diffyculty they are remedyed and repayred againe, And further I demaund what God of the gentiles was ſo puiſſaunt to do this, which the god of the Hebrues dyd in that auncient and opulent realme of the Egypcians? That is to witte, when he would, and when it pleaſed him, he made the ryuers runne bloud, infected the fleſhe, darkened the ayer, dryed the ſeas, &amp; ſlew the firſt begotten, obſcured the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, and did wonders in Chanaan, &amp; other wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thinges in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> read ſea. Finally he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea to drowne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince aliue with al his Egypcians, &amp; that it ſhould let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrues paſſe dry. Yf one of theſe falſe gods had done any one of theſe thinges, it had bene to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed at: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true god doing it we ſhold not meruaile at al. For according to our lytle vnderſtandyng it ſemeth a great thing, but in reſpect of that the deuyne power can do, it is nothing. For wher God putteth his hande, there are no men ſo myghty, no beaſtes ſo proude, nor heauen ſo highe, nor ſea ſo deape, that can reſyſt his power. For as he gaue them power, ſo can he take it from theym at hys pleaſure, Further what God of the gentyles (altough they were aſſembled together) could haue had the power to haue deſtroyed one man only, as the true God dyd? the which in the tyme of kyng Zedechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as) made an hundreth and foure ſcore thouſande of the campe of the aſſiry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans dye, the Hebrues being a ſleape which were their mortal enemyes. And truly in this caſe god ſhewed to princes and greate lordes howe lytle their monnye, and their ſubtyle wyttes preuayle them in feates of warre, when god hath determined another thinge for their deſertes. For in the ende the firſt inuencion of warres proceadeth of mans ambicion and worldlye ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyce, but the victorye of them procedeth of the deuine pleaſoure. What god of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gentyles could haue done that which our true God dyd? when he brought vnder the feete of the renowmed Captayne Ioſue, two and thirty kynges and Realmes, whom he depryued not only from their la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, but alſo bereft theym of theyr lyues, in tearing them in pieces, and deuydyng the myſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble realmes into 12 Tribes. Thoſe realmes (which in old time belonged vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hebrues) were more then 2000 yeres kept of them in tiranny: wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore God would that by the handes of Ioſue they ſhould be reſtored. And though god differred it a long tyme, it was to gyue theym greauous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and not for that god had forgotten them. And althoughe princes do forget manye wronges and tirannies, yet notwithſtandynge riuers of bloude ceaſe not to runne before the face of the dyuine Iuſtice. If all the auncient goddes hadde had power, woulde not they alſo haue holpen their princes? ſince the goddes loſt no leſſe in loſinge theyr temples, then menne loſte in loſing their realmes, For it touched more the caſe of the auncyen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21411:31"/>
to loſe one lytle Temple: thenne for men to loſe a noble Realme We ſee that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goddes of the troians could not reſiſt the greekes, but that both men and gods, gods &amp; men came into Carthage, &amp; from Carthage in to <hi>Trinacrie,</hi> and from <hi>Trinacrie</hi> into Italie, and from Italie tino Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, and from Laurentum into Rome. So they went about flieng, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the gods of Troy were no leſſe conquered of the gods of Greece: then the Dukes and captaynes of grece, were vanquiſhed of the captaynes of Troy, the which thing is hard to them that preſume to be gods. For the true god doth not only make himſelfe feared: but alſo beloued and feared both. That we ſay of the one, the ſame we may wel ſay of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> others. That is to know, that al the gods in the realmes and temples, wherin they honored and ſerued: but wee ſee thone deſtroyeth the other, as it is declared by the Hebrues which were in bondage of the Aſſirians: the Aſſirians of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians: the Perſians of the Macedonians: the Macedonians of the Medes: the Medes of the Grekes: the Grekes of the Penians: the Penians of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maines: the Romaines of the Gothes: the Gothes of the Moores: So that that ther was no realme nor nacion but was conquered. Neyther the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can deny, but they would haue exalted their gods and ceremonies, that the gods &amp; their worſhippers ſhuld not haue end. But in the end both gods and men had al end except the chriſtian religion, which ſhal neuer haue end For it is founded of that which hath neyther beginning nor ending. One of the things which comforteth my hart moſt in the chriſtian religion, is to ſee that ſince the time the churches wer founded, the kinges and princes moſt puiſſant haue ben alwayes theyr enemyes, and the moſt feble and poore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes greateſt helpers and defenders of the ſame. O glorious militaunte church, which now is no other then gold amongeſt the ruſt, a roſe amongeſt the thornes, corne amongeſt the chaffe, marye amongeſt the bones, Marga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rites amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peble ſtones, a holy ſoule amongeſt the rotten fleſh, a Pho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>enix in the cage, a ſhippe rokking in the raging ſeas, which the more ſhe is beaten the faſter ſhe ſayleth.</p>
                     <p>And there is no Realme ſoo litle, nor no manne of ſo litle fauoure but, when other doo perſecute him, hee is by his frendes, parentes and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doures, fauoured and ſuccoured, ſo that manye times thoſe whiche thinke to deſtroye are deſtroyed: &amp; thoſe which ſeme to take their part were their chiefeſt enemies. Doth not that procede of the great ſecret of god? For though God ſuffred the wicked to be wicked a while, god will not therfore ſuffer that one euil man procure an other to do euil.

                     <p>ALthough the common opinion of the ſimple people was, that ther were many gods, yet not withſtandinge al the Phyloſophers affyrmed that ther was but one God (who of ſome was named <hi>Iupiter</hi>) the whiche was chiefe aboue al other gods. Others called him the firſt intelligence, for that he had created al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. Others called him the firſt cauſe, becauſe he was the beginner of all things.

But becauſe they knew not that ther wer good nor bad angels, nor knew not that ther was any paradiſe to reward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good, nor hel to torment the euil: They held thys opinion, that the good men after their death wer gods, and the euyl men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils. And not contented with theſe folyſh abuſes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil brought them into ſuch an errour, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they thought it conſiſted in the Senates power to make ſome gods, and other deuils. For when ther dyed at Rome any Emperour, if he had bene wel willed of the Senate, immediatly he was honoured for a god: and if he died in dyſpleaſure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate, he was condemned for a deuyl. And to the end we do not ſpeake by fauour, but by writting. <hi>Herodian</hi> ſayth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Fauſtine</hi> was the doughter of <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> &amp; wife of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> which wer Emperours the one after the other. And truly ther wer few ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their predeceſſours, or of their ſucceſſours, which wer ſo good as they wer, and in myne opinion more better: &amp; therfore was ſhe made a goddeſſe, and her father a god. An Emperour that coueteth perpetual memory, muſt note 5. thinges which he ſhould haue in his life. That is to ſaye, pure in lyfe, vpright in iuſtice, aduenturous in feates of armes, excellent in knowledge, and welbeloued in his prouinces, which vertues were in theſe 2. excellente Emperors. This Empreſſe <hi>Fauſtine</hi> was paſſing fayre, and the wrytters praiſe her beauty in ſuch ſorte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſayde it was vnpoſſible for her to be ſo beautiful, but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods had placed ſom deuine thing in her. Yet not with ſtanding this added therunto, it is doubtful whether the beauty of her face was more prayſed: then the diſhoneſtie of her lyfe diſcommended.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:21411:32"/>For her beauty maruelouſly amazed thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſaw her, &amp; her diſhoneſty offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them moch that knew her. Yet after the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurèlius</hi> had triumphed ouer the <hi>Parthians,</hi> as he went viſitinge the prouinces of <hi>Aſia,</hi> the goodlye <hi>Fauſtine</hi> in 4. daies dyed in the mounte <hi>Taurus</hi> (by occaſion of a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge feuer) and ſo annealed was caried to Rome. And ſince ſhe was the daughter of ſo good a father, and wife of ſo dearely beloued an Emperour, amonges the Gods ſhe was canonyzed, but conſideringe her vnconſtant or rather incontinent lief, it was neuer thought that the Romaines would haue done her ſo much honor. Wherfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour reioyſed ſo much, that he neuer ceaſed to render thankes vnto the Senate. For truely the benefite ought to be acceptable to him that receiueth it, eſpecially whan it commeth vnloked for. The contrary came to the death of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> third Emperour of Rome, which was not only killed and drawen throughe the ſtreates by the Romans: but alſo the prieſtes of all the Temples aſſembled together, and openly prayed vnto the gods that they would not receiue him to them, and prayed to the infernal furyes that greauouſly they would torment him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge it is iuſtly required, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Tirant which diſpraiſeth the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good in his life, ſhould haue no place amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt the good after his death. Leauing the common opinion of the rude people, whiche in the olde time had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true god, &amp; declaring the opinion of Ariſtole, which called god y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt cauſe: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinion of the Stoickes, which called him the firſte intellige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: and the opinion of <hi>Cicero,</hi> which vnder the colour of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> putteth none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther god but him: I ſaye and confeſſe (according to the religion of chriſtian faith) there is but one only God, which is the creatour of heauen and earth, whoſe excellency and puiſſaunt maieſtie is litle to that our tong can ſpeake. For our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding can not vnderſtand, nor our iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t can determine, neither our memory can comprehende, and much leſſe our tonge can declare it. That which princes and other faithful ought to beleue of god is, that they ought to know god to be almighty and incomparable, a god immortall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, immouable, great, omnipotent, a perfite and ſempiternall God: for all mans power is nothing in reſpecte of his diuine maieſty. I ſaye that our lord god is the onely hyghe god, that if the creature hath any good, it is but a meane good. For a man comparing wel the good which he poſſeſſeth, to the miſery and calamitie whiche perſecute him: with out doubte the euill which foloweth him is greater, then the good which accompanieth him.</p>
                     <p>Alſo our god is immortall and eternall, which like as he had no beginning, ſo ſhall he neuer haue ending. And the contrarye is to the miſerable man, which if ſome ſee him borne, others ſee him dye. For the byrth of the children, is but a memory of the graue to the aged. Alſo God onely is vncorruptible, the which in his beyng hath nother corruption nor diminution: but al mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men ſuffer corruption in their ſoules throughe vyce, and in their bodyes through wormes, for in the end no man is priuileged, but that hys bodye is ſubiecte to corruption, and hys ſoule to be ſaued or damned. Alſo God is no chaungelyng, and in this caſe thoughe he chaungeth his worke, yet he chaungeth not his eternall counſayle. But in men it is all contrarye, for they oftetimes beginne their buſynes with grauitye, and afterward chaung theyr counſeill at a better tyme, and leaue it lyghtlye.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:33"/>I haue now ſhewed you that God only is incomprehenſible, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maieſtie of whom can not be attained, nor his wiſedome vnderſtanded, which thing is aboue mans intelligence. For there is no man ſo ſage nor profound, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an other in an other tyme is as ſage and profound as he. Alſo God onely is omnipotent, for that he hath power not only ouer the lyuinge, but alſo ouer the dead: not onely ouer the good, but alſo ouer the euill: For the man which doth not feele his mercy to giue him glory, he wil make him feele his wrath in giuinge him payne. O ye Princes of this world, trulie it is both iuſte and neceſſarie that you acknowledge ſubiection vnto the Prince of heauen and earthe, whiche in the end althoughe ye be greate, and thynke your ſelues to be muche worthe, although that youe haue muche, and can do muche yet in reſpecte of the ſupreame prince you are nothing worth, neither can ye doe any thing. For there is no Prince in the worlde this daye but can doe leſſe than he would, and would more than he hath. Since all that we haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before is true, let Princes and great Lordes ſee howe conſonaunte it is to reaſon, that ſythe all the creatures were not created but by one: Why then do they not honour one aboue all? For as a Prince will not ſuffer that an other be called kynge in his realme: ſo likewiſe god will not permit that any other be honoured in this worlde but he onely. The father did a greate benefite to vs, for to create vs without the deſire of any man: and alſo the ſonne to redeme &amp; by vs without the healpe of any man, and aboue all the holye ghoſte to make vs chriſtians without the deſert of anye man. For all the good deedes and ſeruices whiche we are able to do, are not ſufficient to requite the leaſte benefite that he ſhewed vnto vs. Princes ought greatly to eſteme ſuche a gyfte, that god hath created them men, and not beaſtes: and muche more they ſhoulde eſteme that they are made Lordes, and not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes: but moſte of all they ought to reioyce, that god hath made them chriſtians, and not gentils, nor Moores. For it profiteth them litle to haue ſcepters and realmes to condempne, if they ſhall not acknowledge the holy church, without the which no man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſaued. O diuine bountie, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny paynims had bene better peraduenture than I, if thou haddeſte choſen them for the churche: &amp; if thou hadſt made me a Paynime, I had bene worſe than they. Thou leaueſt them which haue ſerued the, and haſte choſen me a ſinner which offende the. Lorde God thou knoweſt what thou doeſt, and wher thou art: but I know not what I do, nor what I ſpeake. For we are bounde to praiſe the workes of god, and haue not the lycence to call them backe. The Emperours &amp; paynem kynges, which haue bene good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, (as there hathe bene many) ſo muche leſſe they haue to aunſwer, for that in time of charge they were not called. And likwiſe the contrary to the wicked chriſtian princes. The more goodneſſe they haue receyued without meaſure: ſo muche the more tormentes ſhalbe giuen them in eternall fyre. For accordyng to the ingratitude whiche they haue ſhewed, for the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes by them receiued in this worlde: ſo ſhall the bitterneſſe of their paines be, which they ſhal receiue in hell. Princes are muche bound to do well, becauſe they were created of god reaſonable men: but they are moche more bounde, becauſe they be chriſtians, and more then others bounde, becauſe they were made mighty, and placed in ſo high eſtate, for the greateſt power is not for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21411:33"/>
a prince to haue and poſſeſſe muche, but to profite muche. They do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of a litle and weake tree muche, but that he beare his fruite in dewe time. For a great and high tree, is bounde to giue wood to heate them that be a cold, ſhadow to refreſhe the very trauailours, and frute to confort the neady, and alſo it ought to defend it ſelfe from all importunate windes. For the vertuous prince, ought to be a ſhadow and reſting place, wher the good may couer them ſelues being wearye. The churche dothe moue vs to do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, and our conſcience willeth vs to obſerue more. But if the princes will promiſe me they will do .2. thinges onely, that is to ſay, that they wil be faithfull in the law of god whom they honour, and that they wil not vſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny againſt their people whom they gouerne: from henſforthe I promyſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the glory and felicicie whiche they deſire. For that prince only dieth in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fegarde, which dieth in the loue of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, and hath lyued in the loue of his neyghbour. Princes and great lordes which preſume to be good Chriſtians, ſhould watche greatly that all thinges myght be done to the ſeruice of god, begonne in god, followed in god, and ended in god. And if they will watche in this, I let them knowe, that as touchyng the exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of faith they ſhoulde watche ſo muche, that all ſhoulde knowe, that for the defence of the ſame they are readye to dye. For if the prince beleue that ther is paine for the euill, and rewarde for the good in an other lyfe: it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that he amend his life, and gouerne wel his common wealth. Thinke this for a ſurety, that where the princes feare not god, neither them ſelues nor their realmes can proſper. For the felicitie or miſerie of Realmes, proceadeth not of the paynes and trauailes that the kinges and people doe take: but of the merites which the kinges and realmes deſerue. In great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril liueth that realme, whoſe prince is an euil chriſtian. Happye &amp; ſure is that common wealth, wherof the prince hath a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience. For the man that is of a good conſcience, will not doe any euill thing to the common wealth.</p>

                     <p>THough to men of clere iudgement, the woorkes of God are greate of them ſelues, without anye compariſon to others: yet that the whyte maye be better knowen from the blacke, I will ſatiſfye ſomewhat the curious reader, in rekenyng vp a flocke of falſe gods, that by them and their power, men ſhall ſee how muche the princes are bound to the true God. The auncient Panyms had gods of diuerſe ſortes, how be if the chiefe of al were theſe, which they called <hi>Diis electi.</hi> They would haue ſaid gods of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: whiche gods (as they thoughte) ſometime deſcended from heauen to earth. Theſe gods were .xx. in nombre: as <hi>Ianus, Saturnus, Iupiter, Genius, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius, Apollo, Mars, Vulcanus, Neptunus, Sol, Orcus, Vibar, Tellus, Ceres, Iuno, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerua, Luna, Diana, Venus, Veſta.</hi> Theſe .viii. laſte reherſed were goddeſſes, and .xii. of the firſte were goddes. No man myghte take anye of thoſe as hys owne God, but as common and indifferent to all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:34"/>Their office was to profit all, I meane all of any one Realme, one prouince ſinguler, or one noble citie. And firſt note, they had one God whome they called <hi>Cantius,</hi> whom they honored much, &amp; offred vnto him many ſacrifices, to thende that God might giue them wyſe children. And this if they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of the true God, they ſhould haue had reaſon. For the impoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of humain malice is ſwelled in ſuche wyſe, that that man is in great ieopardie, whom God hath not indued with wyſe iudgement. They had alſo an other Goddeſſe, whom they named <hi>Lucina,</hi> to whom they did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende women, quick and great with chylde, to ſende them ſafe deliuerie. And without the walles of Rome, in a ſtreate called <hi>Salaria,</hi> ſhe had a great churche, wherin all the Romaine women conceiued with childe, did ſacrifice to their goddeſſe <hi>Lucina:</hi> and as <hi>Fronten</hi> declareth <hi>de Veneratione deorum,</hi> there they remayned nyne dayes and nyne nightes, making their vowe. <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> buylte the churche of this goddeſſe, which was plucked downe by the Conſull <hi>Rutilius,</hi> becauſe a doughter of his (great with childe) made her vowe, and kept her nyne <hi>Vigilles,</hi> and vpon more deuotion, was deſirous to be deliuered in the ſaide temple. Suche was her miſhappe, that her deliuery was not onely euill, but her death was much worſe. Whereupon <hi>Rutilius</hi> in his rage, cauſed the temple ſecretly to be burned. For we reade many times, that when the Gentyles ſawe they were diſtreſſed and in great neceſſitie, they recommended them ſelues to their Gods: and if they did not then ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them in their neceſſitie, immediatly they toke from them their ſacrifice, bette downe their temples, or chaunged their Gods. And further, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had an other god called <hi>Opis,</hi> which was called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God of the babe newe borne euen as <hi>Lucina</hi> was goddeſſe of the mother whiche bare it. The cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was, that during all the nyne monethes, that the woman was quick with chylde, ſhe caried the image of the God <hi>Opis</hi> hanging vppon her belly, tyed to her girdle, or ſowed to her garmentes, and at the houre of her deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the mydwyfe toke in her hands the ſaide image, and euen in the verye byrth before herſelfe layde handes vpon it, ſhe firſt of all towched the childe with the Idoll. If the childe were well borne, the parentes that daye made great oblations to the Idoll: but if it were euill or dead borne, ſtraight way the parentes of the childe did beate the image of the poore God <hi>Opis</hi> to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or els burned it, or drowned it in the ryuer. Alſo the Gentyles worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped an other God called <hi>Vaginatus,</hi> and vnto him they did great ſacrifice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their children ſhould not weepe muche: and therfore they caried the image of this god <hi>Vaginatus,</hi> hanged about their neckes, for the Gentiles thought it an euill ſigne and token, whan the Babe wept muche in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, he ſhould haue very euill fortune in his age. They had alſo an other God called God <hi>Cuninus,</hi> him they honoured with ſacrifice, to thend that he ſhould be their Patrone for the ſafetie of their children in their cradels. And thoſe whiche were poore, had the God <hi>Cuninus</hi> hanged vpon the cradell, but the ryche had very ſumptuouſe cradelles, wherein were painted many gods <hi>Cunini<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Herodian,</hi> and <hi>Pulio,</hi> declareth in the life of <hi>Seuerus,</hi> that when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Seuerus</hi> was in the warre againſt the <hi>Gavvles,</hi> his wyfe (whoſe name was <hi>Iulia</hi>) was deliuered of a daughter, whiche was her firſt. And it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that a ſiſter of this <hi>Iulia</hi> named <hi>Meſa</hi> (natiue of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and of the citie of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21411:34"/>
                        <hi>Meſa</hi>) ſent vnto her ſiſter at Rome a cradell, all of an Vnicornes horne, and fine gold: and about the ſame was painted many images of the god <hi>Cuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> The cradel was of ſo great value, that many yeres after it was kept in the Treaſurie of Rome: Though in dede the Romaines kept thoſe thinges, more for the deſire of memorie, than for the loue of ryches. The Romaines had likewiſe an other god, whom they called god <hi>Ruminus,</hi> whiche was as muche to ſaie, as God of ſucking Babes: and to him the matrones of Rome offered diuerſe ſacrifices, to thende he woulde kepe their breaſtes from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and geue them mylke enough for their litle children. And all the whyle they gaue the chyld ſucke, thei had the image of this god about their neckes hanging downe to their breſtes. And euery morning before ſhe gaue the childe ſucke, the mother ſent a diſhe full of mylke to offer to the God <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> and if ſhe happened to be in ſuche place where there was no churche dedicated to the God <hi>Ruminus,</hi> then ſhe bathed her god <hi>Ruminus</hi> ſhe hadde with her, in mylke. They had alſo an other God, whom they called God <hi>Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> and him they impropered to their children when they began to goe. To this god the matrones offered many giftes, that their children might not be lame, Dwarfes, nor impotent or decrepite, but that they might be able to go well. For among the Romaines, thoſe that were Criples or Dwarfes, were had in ſuche contempt, that they could neither beare office in the Senate, nor be admitted prieſtes in the temples. <hi>Hercules</hi> in his thirde booke, <hi>De repub.</hi> ſaith that <hi>Cornelia,</hi> (that worthy woman and mother of the <hi>Gracchi</hi>) had her twoo firſt ſonnes, the one lame, and the other a Dwarfe. Whereupon ſuppoſinge the god <hi>Stellinus</hi> had bene wrath with her, ſhe bylte him a Temple in the .xii. region, neare to the fieldes <hi>Gaditanus,</hi> amongeſt the Gardens of <hi>Detha,</hi> and this temple remained till the tyme of <hi>Randagiſmus,</hi> who beſieging Rome, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Temples, and brake vp their gardines about Rome. They had alſo an other god, called <hi>Adeon,</hi> and his chardge was, that when the childe could goe well, he ſhould go to his mother and make muche of her. And all<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beit <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke <hi>De natura Deorum,</hi> putteth this god amongeſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gods, yet I do not remember that I haue euer read that this god had any Temple in Rome till the tyme of <hi>Mammea,</hi> mother of the Emperoure <hi>Antoninus.</hi> This excellente woman beinge lefte a wydowe, and with two litle children, deſiering that they might be well and vertuouſly brought vp, and that they ſhould increaſe their loue towardes her, ſhe buylte to the god <hi>Adeon,</hi> a ſumptuous Temple in the .xii. region <hi>Vaticanus,</hi> neare to the gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dens of <hi>Domicilius,</hi> and hard adioyning to that alſo, ſhe erected one other edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice called <hi>Sacellum Mammae,</hi> where ſhe abode ſolitarely for a tyme. For the maner and cuſtome at that time was, that all wydowes (whiche woulde bryng vp their children in good diſcipline) ſhould immediatly ſeuer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues farre from the daungerous pleaſures of Rome. The auncientes had alſo an other god called <hi>Mentallis,</hi> which was in effect god of wyt. That is to wyte, he had authoritie and power to giue children good or euill ſence. And to this god the auncientes did great ſacrifices, eſpecially the Greekes, muche more than the Romaines. For as muche as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, that he doth meruayle no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng at all of that the Greekes knewe: but that whiche made him moſt to marueile, was of that they knewe not, ſince they had the temple of the god
<pb facs="tcp:21411:35"/>
                        <hi>Mentallis,</hi> within their ſcholes. All the children whome they ſent to learne Philoſophie, were (by the lawes of <hi>Athens</hi>) bounde to ſerue three yeares in that temple. And to omyt that, whiche <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpake of the Greekes, I dare boldely ſaye and affirme (to many whiche at theſe dayes are liuing) that if it be true, he gaue ſence and vnderſtanding to men, that they would to daye, rather than to morowe, withdrawe them ſelues to goe into thoſe temples, and there offer their vowes. For nothing in the worlde happeneth to men more, then the wante of wytte and vnderſtanding howe to gouerne them ſelues, &amp; lyue in quiet. They had alſo an other God <hi>Volunus,</hi> and a goddeſſe called <hi>Voluna,</hi> theſe two had the charge of affiaunce in wedlocke: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were twoo, becauſe the one ſhould healpe the man, and the other ſhould helpe the woman. The maner was ſuch, that during the time of their mariage, ech of them ware the image of their owne god about their neckes, and thoſe were of golde or ſyluer. And after they were maried, the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grome gaue vnto his ſpouſe the goddeſſe <hi>Voluna,</hi> and the bride vnto her huſbande the god <hi>Volunus.</hi> At ſuche times as the conſulles were created at Rome, and the kings baniſhed, and before the comming of the Emperours, a litle before the <hi>Cornelians</hi> moued ciuill commocions in Rome, there was one Conſull amongeſte all theſe whoſe name was <hi>Balbus.</hi> It is ſayde he was the firſt that builded the temple of <hi>Volunus,</hi> and <hi>Voluna.</hi> It did ſtande in the nynth warde of the citie, neare vnto the gate <hi>Corinthia</hi> and was called <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Balbi.</hi> And nighe vnto it was an other building called <hi>Theatrum Balbi.</hi> All the Conſuls, Senatours, noble and renowmed barons, were maried in the Temple which <hi>Balbus</hi> builte. That night that <hi>Pompey</hi> the great maried <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> daughter, there were ſome that ſaide, that <hi>Pompey</hi> refuſed to marie her in the temple of the gods <hi>Volunus,</hi> and <hi>Voluna,</hi> whereupon they diuined ſtraight that the mariage would not indure long betwixt them. As wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>Publius Victor</hi> in his thirde booke <hi>De nuptijs antiquorum.</hi> The auncient Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gans honoured a god called <hi>Agreſtes,</hi> as muche to ſaye, as the god of fieldes and fruites: to him they offred no ſacrifice but twyſe in the yeare, that is to wete, in ſeede time, and in harueſt. The <hi>Phrigians</hi> (that is the <hi>Troyans</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians</hi>) greatly obſerued this god <hi>Agreſtes,</hi> and it was for that in thoſe twoo countries there was gathered ſuche plentie of corne to make bread, that <hi>Phri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> was the great garner of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Trinacria</hi> (that was <hi>Cicilia</hi>) was the corne houſe of <hi>Europe.</hi> They had another god called <hi>Belus,</hi> which was patrone of men of warre. For euen as the Chriſtians (when they come to the poynte to geue the battayle) make their praiers vnto god: ſo likewyſe the auncientes in the ſame pointe did knele downe, and recommende them ſelues to god <hi>Belus. Liuie</hi> declareth, that in all other thinges which were done, and wherof the Romaine knightes were accuſed in the battaile of <hi>Cannas</hi> (againſt <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi>) was for that they did not recommende them ſelues at all to the god <hi>Belus,</hi> when they ſhould giue battayle, ſaying the <hi>Carthagians</hi> remayned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours, becauſe they a litle before honoured the god <hi>Mars:</hi> &amp; the Romaines were vanquiſhed, for that they offred no ſacrifice to god <hi>Belus.</hi> When <hi>Pirrus,</hi> king of the Epirotes (that is of <hi>Albanie</hi>) came into Italie, and that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes were aduertiſed, he brought with him many engins, and ſubtile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions for the warre, they agreed to buylde a Temple for the god <hi>Belus,</hi>
                        <pb n="15" facs="tcp:21411:35"/>
within the walles of Rome, in the nynth warde nere the gate <hi>Carmentalle,</hi> &amp; it was named <hi>Edes Beloe,</hi> in the fronte whereof was a marueylous ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſtately pyller, wherein was grauen thorder of battayle. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had another god called the god of victorie, to whome the Romaines (more then any other nation) did ſacrifices, to thende they might obtayne victorie of their enemies. Of this god <hi>Victoria,</hi> there was many magnificall temples in Rome, but the chiefeſt and the greateſt was adioyning to the gate <hi>Venia,</hi> in the twelfte warde, in the place called <hi>Della victoria.</hi> It was builte in the yeare of the foundation of Rome, foure hundreth, thre ſcore and ſeuentene. And it was for thoccaſion of the victorie, that <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> had in Scicill, the firſte tyme the Romaine people foughte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Affricanes, <hi>Herones</hi> being king. Of this warre and victorie, roſe the cruell, long, and perillous warres betwene Rome and Affrike. There was another god amongeſt the gods, whome the auncientes called <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> whiche had the charge that the Inkeapers ſhould honour and gently in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tertaine Pylgrimes, and ſtraungers: ſo that they ſhould be well handled, through the prouinces and realmes whereby they paſſed. And there was a cuſtome in Rome, that euer when any Romaine ſhould goe any vyage, his wyfe immediatly ſhould go to the temple of god <hi>Honorius</hi> to doe her ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In the fiftene yeare after that <hi>Hannibal</hi> paſſed into Italie, the Romains knewe by a prophecie, that as ſone as they brought the image of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Berecinthia</hi> (mother of all the gods) into Rome: ſo ſone <hi>Hannibal</hi> ſhoulde retire out of Italy. And to bryng this to paſſe, the Romaines ſent their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours into Phrigia, whiche is one parte of Aſia, to thende they ſhoulde brynge the goddeſſe <hi>Berecinthia</hi> to Rome. And becauſe their Embaſſadours ſhould go well and retourne ſafe, and that in comming and going throughe the Realmes, they ſhould entertaine them well, and doe them honoure: they buylt a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple for the god <hi>Honorius</hi> within the walles of Rome, in the fourth warde, in a place whiche they called <hi>Forum Tranſitorium.</hi>

and if the maladie were great, they called vppon the God <hi>Apollo,</hi> whiche was father to <hi>Eſculapius Spinenſis</hi> was a god whome the auncientes prayed to kepe the corne from thiſtles and thornes. <hi>Rubigo</hi> was a god which kepte the Vines from wormes, and the corne from locuſtes. <hi>Fortuna</hi> was the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe of good fortune: and to her the auncient wyues of Rome made a temple, in the tyme of <hi>Silla</hi> and <hi>Marius.

And therefore the auncientes painted her, holding in her right hande a handfull of ſtrawe, and the eares were whole. <hi>Forculus</hi> was the God of Lockeſmythes, and the auncientes ſacrificed hym, becauſe he ſhould locke faſte the dores, and ſhould not ſuffer them to be broken open, nor picked, nor adultered keyes to be made: the auncientes paynted this God holdinge a chayne in one hande, and twoo doores in the other: his image was ouer the gate of <hi>Trigemine,</hi> and ſpecially ouer their doores that hadde enemies. <hi>Limentimen</hi> was God of the hammers of the gates. I coulde not fynde what the entention was to inuente thys God, but as I thynke (not for that I haue founde it wrytten) they prayed this God that when there ſhoulde come anye ennemy of theirs to the houſe, that he ſhoulde cauſe them ſtumble, and fall before the dore, if perhappes by negligence it were lefte open. <hi>Portulus</hi> was the god of the gates, and the auncientes dyd paynte hym with twoo gates in his handes, and did ſacrifice hym, becauſe no man ſhould open the gates to the enemies when they ſlepte: and to hym the Romaines did ſacrifice in all the gates of Rome, and thoſe whiche hadde enemies, would paynte hym in the gate of their houſe. <hi>Cardea</hi> was a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe of the barres &amp; hingies of the gates, and the cauſe why the auncientes did ſacrifice to her, was that no man ſhoulde breake the gates, nor lift vp the hingies, and that if they went about to put to their handes, immediatly the hingies ſhould make a noyſe to wake the maiſter of the houſe that he might heare it, and knowe that his enemies were at the gate. There was another god who was called <hi>Siluanus,</hi> and he was moſte honoured among the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes, eſpecially among all the Romaines. This god had the charge to kepe thoſe from perill and miſfortune that went for their pleaſure and recreation to the Gardeynes, as <hi>Plynie</hi> ſayeth in an epiſtle he wrote to <hi>Rutilius.</hi> The firſte that buylte a temple for the god <hi>Syluanus,</hi> was <hi>Mecenas,</hi> whiche was in the tyme of <hi>Auguſtus.</hi> And he deſyred aboue all other men, to make feaſtes and bankettes in Gardeins. This temple was in the eleuenth warde, in the fielde of the goddeſſe <hi>Venus,</hi> neare vnto the houſe of <hi>Murcea,</hi> whiche was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied in the time of the Emperour <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> throughe an earthquake, whereby many buyldinges and houſes fell in Rome. <hi>Iugatibus</hi> was the god of mariages, who had charge to make the loue which begon in youth, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure till the olde age. It was wonderfull to ſee how the women newly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, went on pylgremage for deuotion vnto this god, and what giftes and preſentes they offered in his temple. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> ſaithe, that there was a Temple of this God, but I fynde not in wrytyng by whome it was buylte: ſauyng that <hi>Helius Spartianus</hi> ſayth, that the Emperoure <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> founde muche rycheſſe in the Temple of <hi>Iugatibus,</hi> the whiche he tooke away to mayntayne his warres.</p>

                        <hi>Bacchus</hi> was the God of, drunkardes, and the cuſtome in Rome was, that only madde men and fooles celebrated the feaſte of this God, and if there wer found any of wit &amp; vnderſtandyng (wer it neuer ſo litle) they thruſt him forthewith out of the Temple, and ſoughte in his ſteade another drunkard. The Temple of Bacchus was in the tenthe warde, in the medowes which they call <hi>Bacchanales,</hi> withoute the citie, in the waye of Salaria, by the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Goddeſſe <hi>Februa,</hi> and it was bilte by the Gaules, when they beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Rome in the time of Camillus. <hi>Februa</hi> was a goddeſſe for the feuers, and they vſed in Rome when any was taken with the feauer, immediatelye to ſende ſome ſacrifice vnto her.</p>
                     <p>This Goddeſſe hadde no temple at al, but her Image was in Pautheon, whiche was a temple wherein al the goddes were, and in this place they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed vnto her. <hi>Pauor</hi> was the God of feare, who hadd the charge to take feare from the Romaines hartes, and to gyue them ſtoute courage againſt their enemies. The Temple of this god Pauor was in Rome, in the ſixte warde, in the place of <hi>Mamuria,</hi> nere the olde Capitoll: and euer when they had any enemyes, the Romaynes forthewith offred in this place ſacrifices, and there was in the ſame temple a ſtatue of <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Affricane</hi> all of ſiluer, which he offred there when he triumphed ouer the Carthagians.</p>

                        <hi>Meretrix</hi> was the goddeſſe of diſhoneſt women, and as <hi>Publius Victor</hi> ſaieth, there was in Rome fourty ſtreates of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men women, in the myddeſt wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the temple of this <hi>Meretrix</hi> was.

Wherefore in memorye of her the Romaynes bilt ther a temple, and made her Goddeſſe of all the common women in Rome. <hi>Cloatina</hi> was God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe of the ſtoole, and to this goddeſſe all thoſe commended them ſelues whiche were troubled with the Collycke, to thend ſhe would healpe them to purge their bealies. <hi>Quies</hi> was the goddeſſe of reſt, and to her the Romaynes did great ſacrifices, becauſe ſhe ſhould gyue them pleaſour and reſt, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye one that day, when there was any triumphe in Rome, they gaue in this Temple many gyftes, becauſe ſhe ſhould preſerue the glorye and ioye of the triumphes. <hi>Nunia Pompilius</hi> (ſeconde Kyng of the Romaynes) builte the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Goddeſſe, and it was without the citie, for to note that durynge the lyfe of man in this worlde, he coulde neyther haue pleaſoure nor reſte. <hi>Theatrica</hi> was a goddeſſe, that had the charge to kepe the Theatres &amp; Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyes, when the Romaynes celebrated their playes: and thoccaſion of inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this Goddeſſe was, becauſe when the Romaynes woulde ſet forthe their tragedies, they made ſo ſolempne theatres, that there myghte wel ſtand xx. thouſand men aboue, &amp; as manye vnderneth for to beholde the ſpectacle.

And how God depriued <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the yonger, both of his empire and ſences for being an heretike. Cap. xiii.</head>
                     <p>THe fiftye Emperour of Rome, was <hi>Tiberius Conſtantinus,</hi> who ſucceded <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the younger which was a cruell Emperoure. And <hi>Paulus Diaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſayeth, that he was an enemye to the poore: a thefe to the rich, a great lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of riches, and an enemy to him ſelfe in ſpending them. For the propertie of a couetous man is to liue like a begger all the dayes of his lyfe, and to be founde riche at the houre of his deathe. This <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> was ſo couetous, that hee commaunded coffers and cheſtes of iron to bee made, and brought into his palayce to kepe the treaſours whiche he hadde robbed. And of this you ought not to meruel, for <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth, that couetous Prynces doo not onely ſuſpect their ſubiectes, but alſo theym ſelues. In thoſe dayes the church was greatly defyled, by the hereſye of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and the mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyner of that ſect was this wicked Prince <hi>Iuſtinian:</hi> ſo that for him ſelfe he procured riches, and for the Deuill he cheapned ſoules. For thoſe that are once forſaken of the hande of God, do not only become ſeruantes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, but alſo labour to allure others to hell. Wherfore ſith the ſinnes of men are dyuerſe, and the iudgements of God kept ſecrete, and that yet the lyuing God is ſo merciful, that not with ſtanding his mercy would ſaue the ſoules, he wil alſo with iuſtyce chaſtiſe the bodies. And therfore ſeing the obſtinacye of this Emperour to be ſuch that the lenger he lyued the more he augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his damnacion, the wrathe of God lighted vpon him, and ſodainly with out any grudge or toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſicknes, this Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> was derriued of his ſences &amp; became a foole: &amp; becauſe the matter was ſo ſodaine, it cauſed in Rome great feare, and admiracion, for that the Prince was a foole, and all the Empire chaunged. And in dede This Emperour was ſo ſtryken, that his life and follye ended both in one day. For the dyſeaſes which God ſendethe to Princes, commeth not through faulte of humours, but through the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupcion of maners. Alſo ther is no medicyne that can reſiſt it, nor yet anye other thing that can remedye it. The people perceiuyng howe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour through hys ſynnes was (according to the diuine pleaſoure) become a foole, agreed (ſythe there was no remedye for his dyſſeaſe) to chuſe ſome good perſon to whom the charge of the publyke weale myght be gyuen.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:38"/>
For trulye a man needeth greater pacience and wyſedome to gouerne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans, then for that whiche is his owne proper. The lotte befell to a Knyghte <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſo called, a man for a truthe bothe chaſte, iuſte, profitable, ſage, vertuous, hardy, merciful, charitable, in feates of armes aduenturous, and aboue all a good Chriſtian. And let not this thynge be lytle regarded that the Prince be a good Chriſtian. For there is no ſtate ſo happy as that, whiche is gouerned by a Prince of a good and faitheful conſcience, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wanted no vertues to adorne a Prince, he was both feared of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, and beloued of all. Which thinge oughte not lyghtlye to be eſtemed, for it is the chiefeſt thinge that belongethe to Prynces, that is to wete, for their gentle conuerſacion to be beloued, and for their vprighte iuſtice, to be feared. This Emperour Iuſtinian had a wyfe, whoſe name was <hi>Sophia Auguſta,</hi> whyche was beautifull and ſage, and as touchynge her perſon, of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme ſufficient. For women muſt take great reſpect, leaſt they giue ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers occaſion to ſpeake of them, but notwithſtanding al theſe thinges, thys dame was noted of couetouſnes. For ſhe toyled alwayes to hourde vp mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, and delighted to ſee and tell it, but to ſpende or giue it, was alwayes her greateſt griefe. For couetous parſones lytle regarde to ſhorten their lyfe, ſo that they maye augment their ryches. <hi>Tiberius Conſtantine,</hi> as gouernour of the Empire (ſeinge the Empreſſe <hi>Sophia Auguſta</hi> ryche, and deſiring more the profite of the common wealthe, then the enrychement of hym ſelfe or of any other) did nothyng els but builde monaſteryes, repayre hoſpytalles, marye Orphanes, and redeme captyues. For ſpeakynge accordyng to the Chriſtian lawes, that that a man hath more then neceſſarye, oughte to be employed to the vſe of the poore, and to workes of mercy. Finally this vertuous prince did that whiche Chriſtian Princes ſhoulde doe, and not as tirauntes do, whiche made him of great excellencye. For the propertie of a tyraunte is to heape great treaſours of other mens goodes, and afterwarde to ſpend and conſume them viciouſly: but <hi>Tiberius</hi> founde them gathered together by one and he diſparſed them to many: <hi>Sophia Auguſta,</hi> ſeing <hi>Iuſtinia</hi> become a foole, and not knowynge how to get more mony of the people, nor how to robbe the riche, and that <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſpente her ryches withoute compaſſyon, partelye to ſatiſfie her ſorowfull hart, &amp; partly to ſee if in time to com ſhe could reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it, called one day <hi>Tiberius</hi> a part &amp; ſpake vnto him theſe wordes in ſecret.</p>

Thou beinge ſuch a man as thou arte, and ſo wel willed and beloued of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> my huſband, art demaunded of the Romaine people, and choſen by the Senate, receiued by the ſouldiours, and al the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire reioyce at thy election.</p>

                        </gap>t righte well, that to commaunde more, to doe more, and to haue more then other (as touching the affayres of Princes) oftentimes is giuen more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughe worldly care, then for the deſerte of the perſonne. And this God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth very ofte, to the ende we may ſee thoſe diſcende and fall through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy: whom we ſaw mounte and proſper by pryde. Thou art a man, and I a woman, Thou haſt wiſedom and knowledge, but I haue large and long experience, and if thou knoweſt much, I haue ſeene in the worlde enough, but in faith for that I haue ſayd I tell the, that men of thy ſorte are vndone in the palaice of princes by 2. waies. The one, if they thinke they deſerue much, and they can doe litle. For hauty mindes brynge alwayes alteration in the harte. The other is, that one alone will commaund the Emperour and the empire: whereunto if any man come, it is by greate trauayle, and he ſhall ſuſtayne it with daunger, and ſhall poſſeſſe it but a ſhorte time. For it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to a man of muche arrogancie, fortune ſhould be to long faithful.</p>
                     <p>Though thou be wyſe and ſage, I counſell the alwayes to profite with an other mans counſaile, chiefely in thinges concerninge the gouernemente of the ſtate. For to know to obey, and to know to commaunde differ much.</p>
                     <p>For to know to obey, commeth by nature: but to knowe to commaunde, commeth by long experience. Take this of me for a generall rule, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou ſeeſt they praier to be acceptable, neuer take vpon the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for by commaundement thou ſhalte be feared, and by prayer thou ſhalte be beloued. Know thou <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the thinges that content the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worſte, which ar in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court of Princes: are to do litle, to haue litle, &amp; to be litle worth.</p>
                     <p>For the man that is without fauour, in his heart is halfe dead. For the contrary, the thing whiche moſt perilleth the fauored of Princes &amp; maketh them loaſe their frendſhipp, is to be of great power, and great in autoritie, &amp; more ouer than this, to profite more of will then of knowledge, of auctoritie than of reaſon. For a man can not lyue long in frendſhyppe, whych dothe what he wyll in the common wealthe. I haue ſpoken all thys to thende thou ſhouldeſt knowe that I greatlye maruayle at thy prudence, and haue no leſſe wonder of my pacience. To ſee that the treaſours whych <hi>Iuſtinian</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:39"/>
heaped together by great trauaile, kept and preſerued with great care, thou waſteſt without reſpect what thou doeſte. And doe not maruaile at this: For ther is no pacience can ſuffer to ſe the proper gods waſted and ſpent by the hands of an other, which w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo great care hath ben gathered together. I let the know <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that now we haue neyther money to kepe, nor to gyue to others, which thing is very peryllous for the palace of Princes. For the fame to haue great treaſours, cauſeth Princes to keape their enemyes in feare. It is neceſſarie for princes to bee ſtoute, and alſo riche, for by their ſtoutnes they maye gouerne their owne, and by their riches, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe their enemyes. It is not only neceſſarie that the Prince be not poore, but alſo it is requiſitie that his common wealth be rych. For where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are poore, of their enemies they are nothinge regarded: and where the common wealth is riche, the Prince can not be greatly poore. I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay but that it is wel done to help the poore, and ſuccour the needy. But yet I ſay, that no man ought to giue the treaſour to any one particulerly, which is kepte for the preſeruation of al. For oftentimes the prince which is to ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral in geuing his owne, is after wardes through neceſſitie compelled to be a Tyranne, and take from others. I let the wete <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that thou ſhalte finde few Princes but are proude, maglignaunt, or vicious. For of a trouth wantonneſſe, lybertie, youthe, and riches, are cruell enemyes to honeſtie, I wyll not ſay that all princes haue bene euil, but I wil ſay ther hath bene but few good, and thoſe which are or wil be good, ought to be greatly honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For no time ought to be called happie, but that wherin vertuous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do reygne.</p>
                     <p>And I ſay to the further <hi>Tiberius,</hi> if Princes become Tyrants for want of riches, ſo do they become vicious through aboundaunce of treaſurs, and in this caſe, vicious princes are chaſtened in the ſame vyce. For auarice hath ſuch power ouer them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſuffereth them not to taſte their owne delight.</p>
                     <p>And I let the wete <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that there are many Princes whiche are of good nature, and yet become Tyrants, for nothing els but becauſe they be oppreſſed with pouertie.. For truly the noble hart refuſeth no daunger, ſeing him ſelfe aſſaulted with pouertie.</p>
                     <p>Therfore I demaund of the which is better, or otherwiſe which of theſe two euilles is leaſte: that the Prince be poore, and with that a Tiranne: or that he be riche, and therwith vicious.</p>
                     <p>In mine opinion it wer much better to be riche and viciouſe, then a tiranne and poore: for in the end if he do euil by vyce, he ſhould be euil to no man but to himſelfe: by riches he ſhould profit al the people. And if he be poore and a tyranne, he ſhould do great euil to many, and by pouertie he could profit no man. For the poore prince cannot maintaine the riche, and much leſſe ſuccour the poore, without compariſon it is more profitable to the common wealth, and more tollerable to men, that the Prince be an euil man, and therwithall a good prince: than an euil Prince, and therwithal a good man. For as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaithe, the Athenians wold alwayes rather ſeeke a profitable, then a ſtoute Prince: and the Lacedemonians dyd erre, in willing rather a ſtoute Prince then profitable. Therfore ſee <hi>Tiberius,</hi> it is more ſure and profitable for the common wealthe, that Princes haue treaſours to giue lyberalye amonge
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21411:39"/>
their ſeruantes: then that they ſhould be poore and enforced to oppreſſe their people with taxes and ſubſidies. For princes oftetimes throughe pouertie, take occaſion to leauy great ſubſedies in their realmes and ſeignories.</p>

Speaking ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with ſuch reuerence (as is due vnto ſo hyghe a Ladie) to euerye one of theſe things which your excellencie hath tolde me, I wil aunſwere in one word. For it is reaſon, ſithe you haue ſpoken that which you perceyue of my deedes: that I ſpeake that which I gather of your words. You tell me that when I was in <hi>Alexandrie</hi> I thought not to be gouernour of the empire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> and that I thought not my ſelfe worthy to deſerue it, nor yet lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to come vnto it. To this I aunſwere, that thoughe by reaſon I gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my ſelfe at that tyme, yet I ought not to thinke to deſerue ſuch a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, nor to come to ſo highe an eſtate. For thoſe whiche by vertues deſerue great dignities are but few: and fewer are thoſe which attayne vnto them though they deſerue them. But if this matter be iudged accordyng to ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alitie, I tel you truly (dame <hi>Auguſta,</hi>) that I thought not only to deſerue it, but alſo I thought to come vnto it. And hereof marueyle not, for it is an vnfallible rule, wher leeſte deſert is, ther is moſt preſumption. You ſaye you eſtemed me for a wiſe man, and that by wiſedome I could ouercome any diſordinate appetite. To this I anſwere, that you knewe my wiſedome ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in mine owne buſines, or els in other mens affayres. Yf in other mens affayres, (where it dyd coaſt me nought) I was alwayes a louer of iuſtice. For there is no man in the world ſo euyl, that doth not deſire (if it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his owne coaſt) to be counted lyberall. But if you iudge me (Dame <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta</hi>) on mine owne buſines, giue not to lyghte credite. For I will that you know, ther is no man ſo iuſte, nor of ſo clere a iudgement, that doth not ſhew him ſelfe frayle in matters which touche his owne intereſt. You ſay that men which haue their thoughtes hyghe, and their fortune baſe, lyue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a penſife lyfe. Truly it is as you ſay. But in mine opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the bodyes are but inſtrumentes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind, ſo is it neceſſary for men to haue quicke and ſharpe wittes, if they wil not be neglygente. For if
<pb facs="tcp:21411:40"/>
                        <hi>Alexander, Pyrrus, Iulius Ceſar, Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Hanniball,</hi> had not bene hyghe myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they had not bene (as they were) ſo noble and ſtout Princes.</p>
                     <p>I let you vnderſtand, moſt noble Princeſſe, that men are not loſt for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their thoughtes hygh, nor for hauing their hartes couragious, neyther for being hardie and ſtout: but they are vndone, becauſe they begin thinges throughe folie, purſue them without wiſdome, and atchieue them without diſcreſſion.</p>
                     <p>For noble men enterpriſing great things, ought not to employ their force as their noble hart willeth, but as wiſedome and reaſon teacheth. You ſay, you meruaile why I waſt the treaſours without care, which <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> and you gathered togethers with great paine. To this I aunſwere, you oughte not to meruayle if all the treaſours you heaped together of ſo longe tyme, were ſpent and conſumed in one day. For ther is an auncient malediction on riches hydde, and treaſours buried, which <hi>Epimenides</hi> caſteth out ſayinge theſe words. All the treaſours hurded vp by the couetous, ſhal be waſted by the prodigall. You ſay through that I waſt in few dayes, you ſhall haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to giue, to waſt, nor yet to eate at the yeres ende. To this I aunſwere moſt gracious princeſſe, that if you had bene as ready to releue the poore, as you &amp; <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> were dilygent to robbe the riche: then you ſhould iuſtly haue complayned, and I worthely might haue repented. Tyll now we haue not ſene, but that of the riche you haue made poore, &amp; notwithſtanding this, yet you haue not gotten enoughe to buyld an Hoſpital for the poore. You ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes to reſiſt their enemyes haue neede of greate treaſours. To this I aunſwere, if Princes be proud, gready, and of ſtraunge realmes ambicious, it is moſt certaine that they nede great treaſours to accompliſhe their diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate appetites. For the end of a tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nous prince is, by hooke or by crooke to make him ſelfe riche in his lyfe. But if the Prince be or wil be a man repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, quyte, vertuous, paciente, peaceable, and not couetous of the good of an other man, what nede hath he of great treaſours? For to ſpeake truly, in princes houſes ther is more offence in that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> auaunceth, then in that that wanteth. I wil not waſt many words in aunſweringe, ſithe I am muche more liberal of dedes then of wordes: but I conclude, that ther is no Prince which in vertuous dedes waſteth ſo much, but if he wil, he may ſpend much more. For in the end, princes become not poore ſpending their goodes vpon neceſſaries: but for waſting it vpon things ſuperfluous. And take this word for al, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for this he ſhal not be the porer, but rather y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> richer: For it is a general rule in Chriſtian reglion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god wil giue more to his ſeruaunts in one houre, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wil waſt in 20. yeres. <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> was Emperour .11. yeres, who (being a foole, and obſtinate in the hereſye of <hi>Pellagien</hi>) died to the great offence of the Romaine people, whoſe death was aſmuch deſired, as his life abhorred. For the tirannous prince, that maketh many wepinge eyes in his life, ſhall cauſe many reioyſing harts at his death. <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> being dead, <hi>Tiberius</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Emperour, who gouerned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> empire through ſo great wiſedom and iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was able to reproue him if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hiſtories in his time did not deceiue vs. For it ſeldo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hapeneth to a prince to be as he was, vpright in iuſtice, pure in life, &amp; clene in conſcience. For few are thoſe princes which of ſome vices are not noted <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> in his 18 boke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romain geſtes, declare a thing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21411:40"/>
merueilous which be fell to this emperour at that time, and very worthy to know at this preſent. And it is, that in the Citie of Conſtantinople the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Emperours had a palace very ſumptuous, and beſemyng the aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the imperiall maieſty, which was begonne in the time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the greate, and afterwardes as the ſucceſſion of good or euyll Emperours was, ſo were the buildings decayed or repayred. For it is the deede of a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Prince, to abolyſhe vices of the common wealth, and to make greate and ſumptuous buildinges in his country. This Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> hadde ſpent treaſours to redeme poore captiues, to build hoſpitalles, to erect mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries, to marie and prouide for the Orphanes and widowes, in this he was ſo prodigall, that it came almoſt to paſſe that he had nothing to eate in his palaice. And truly this was a bleſſed neceſſitie. For catholike Princes ought to thinke that well employed, which in the ſeruice of Chriſt is beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed. And hereof the Emperoure was not aſhamed, but thought it a great glory, and that which onely greued him was, to ſee the Empreſſe reioyce ſo much at his miſerye. For the high and noble hartes which feele them ſelues wounded, do not ſo much eſteme their owne paine, as they do to ſee their enemyes reioyce at their griefe. God neuer forſoke theym that for his ſake became poore, as it appeareth by this: It chaunced one day that euen as the Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> walked in the middeſt of his palace, he ſaw at his feete a marble ſtone, whiche was in fourme of the croſſe, of the reademer of the world. And becauſe it had bene to vniuſte a thing (as he thoughte) to haue ſpurned that with his feete, wherwith we truſt from our enemyes to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: he cauſed the ſtone to be taken vp, (not thinking any thing to be ther vnder) and immediatly after they found an other, wherin likewiſe was the forme of the croſſe, and this beyng taken vp, they founde an other in lyke ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner, and when that was pluct vp from he bottome, there was found a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor which conteyned the ſome of 2. millions of Duckettes, for the which the good Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> gaue vnto all mighty god moſt high thankes, and wheras before he was lyberal, yet afterwardes he was much more bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: For all thoſe treaſours he diſtrybuted amongeſt the poore and needye people. Let therfore mighty princes, and great lords ſee, reade, and profit by this example, and let them thinke them ſelues aſſured, that for geuing almes to the poore, they nede not feare to become poore: for in the end the vycious man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not cal him ſelf rich, nor the vertuous man can counte him ſelfe poore.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:41"/>This knightes name was <hi>Narſetes,</hi> and becauſe he was ſo valliant in armes and ſo aduenturous in warres: he was choſen Chefeteyne generall of the Romane Empire. For the Romaines had this excellency, that when they had a valiaunt and ſtoute captaine (although they might haue his weighte of gold giuen them) they would neuer depart from his perſon. He enterpriſed ſo great thinges, he ouercame ſuch mighty realmes, and had ſuche notable victories ouer his enemyes, that the Romaines ſaid he had in him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtrength of <hi>Hercules,</hi> the hardineſſe of <hi>Hector,</hi> the noblenes of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the policye of <hi>Pirrus,</hi> and the fortune of <hi>Scipio.</hi> For many of the vaine gentils held opinion, that as the bodyes dyd diſtribute their goodes in the lyfe: ſo did the ſoules parte their giftes after the deathe. This <hi>Narſetes</hi> was a pitefull captaine, and very conſtant in the faith of Chriſt, lyberall to giue almes, effectuous to build new monaſteries, and in repairing churches a man very carefull. And truly it was a rare thing. For in great warres (vpon ſmal occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) captaines vſe to beate downe Churches, and that which was greateſt of all, was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hee ſerued god deuoutlye, viſited the hoſpitalles, ſaide his deuocions wyth great teares, and aboue al, reſorted very oft to the churche in the night, And this excellency was no leſſe then the other.

Fynally he was a chriſtian and ſo deuoute, that god gaue hym the victories more through the praiers which he vſed, than through the wea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pons wherwith he ſought. For there was neuer man that ſawe him ſhedde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of his enemyes in bataile, before he had ſhedde the teares of his eyes in the temple. And to the end Chriſtian princes and captaynes may ſee how muche better it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to pacifye god by teares and prayers, then to haue their campe ful of ſouldiours and riches, of many of his doinges I wyll declare part as here foloweth.</p>

                        <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Emperour being in <hi>Alexandrye, Totila</hi> king of the Gothes, dyd many miſcheues and great domages through out all Italy, ſo that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines durſt not go by the way, nor could be in ſafegard in their houſes. For the Gothes in the day kept the wayes, and in the night robbed and ſpoyled all the people, wherfore <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the Emperour not knowinge the matter, ſent the noble <hi>Narſetes</hi> as captaine generall againſt the Gothes, who beinge arryued in Italye immediatly confedered with the Lumbardes, the which at that tyme had their manſion in Hungarie, and ſente his meſſangers to kyng <hi>Alboinus,</hi> (at that tyme their king) for ayde againſt the Gothes, and in ſo doinge he ſaide he ſhould ſee howe faithfull a frende he would be to hys frendes: and how cruell an ennemy to his ennemyes. <hi>Alboinus</hi> hearinge the meſſage of <hi>Narſetes</hi> was very glad, and without delay immediatlly armed a great &amp; puiſant army, which by the Adriaticale ſea came into Italy: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the anſwere and the offer came both at one time with effect, and ſo together ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued in one daye (for the ſuccour of <hi>Narſetes</hi>) the 2. armies: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, that of the Romaines and of the Lumbards, the which aſſembled al in one &amp; mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnder the banner of their captaine <hi>Narſetes.</hi> Wherfore <hi>Totila,</hi> king of the Gothes being aduertiſed, (as one that had not proued the happie fortune of <hi>Narſetes,</hi> nor the force of the Lumbardes) ſent to offer them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battayle, which was giuen in the fieldes of <hi>Aquileia:</hi> and it was of bothe partes ſo fierſe and cruel, that infinyte were they that dyed: but in the end <hi>Totilla</hi> kynge of

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> towards their king <hi>Alboinus.</hi> And truly this <hi>Narſetes</hi> did as he was bound to do. For the frend cannot be recompenced by ryches, when for his frend he putteth his lyfe in ieopardy. When the Lumbardes wer gone, <hi>Narſetes</hi> cauſed al the ſpoyle of his campe to be deuided amongeſte his ſouldyers, and that which belonged vnto him, he gaue it wholy to the poore monaſteries: ſo that by this vyctorie <hi>Narſetes</hi> gotte triple renowne. That is to wete, very bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in that he gaue to the Lumbardes, charitable in that hee gaue to the poore, and valyant in that he vanquiſhed ſo puiſſant enemyes. <hi>Dagobert</hi> king of Fraunce beyond the alpes, beyng a coragyous younge Prince, and verye deſirous of honor (for no other cauſe but to leaue of him ſome memory) deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myned him ſelfe in parſon to paſſe into <hi>Italie,</hi> althoughe he had no iuſte title therunto. For the hartes puffed vp with pried lytel paſſe though they warre of an vniuſt quarrell. His myſhape was ſuche, that the ſame daye he paſſed the riuer of <hi>Rubico</hi> (wher the Romaynes in old time limyted the marches of <hi>Italye</hi>) newes came to him that his owne countrye was vp, and thoſe which were there, one rebelled againſt the other, the whiche was not without the greate ſufferaunce of God. For it is but reaſon that that king ſhoulde loaſe his owne realme by deuine iuſtice, which wil take other mens only through mans folly. The kyng <hi>Dagobert</hi> aſſembling all the chiefeſte of his realme to counſayle, it was agreed and concluded by all, that hee alone in perſonne ſhould returne into Fraunce, and for his reputacion ſhould leaue all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye in Italy. Wherof remayned captaines, <hi>Buccelinus,</hi> and <hi>Amingus.</hi> For it is better for a prince to defend his country by iuſtice, then to conquere another by tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny. As this armie of <hi>Buccelinus</hi> was great, ſo was he couragious, and wrought many &amp; great domages in <hi>Italie,</hi> eſpeciallye in the land of <hi>Campag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> And worſe then that, al the riches y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had ſacked, &amp; al the captiues he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he wold neyther reſtore nor yet ſuffer them to be raunſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med: but ſo ſone as he toke them he ſent theym vnto the king, as one that ſhewed him ſelfe more deſirous to robbe and ſpoile, then to fight and wage battaile. This captaine <hi>Buccelinus</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being in Campagnia, retired into a place called Tare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum with al his army becauſe of winter, <hi>Narſetes</hi> ſodainly came vpon him &amp; gaue him battaile, That was betwene theym very cruell, wherin <hi>Buccelinus</hi> was vanquyſhed and left deade in the field, amongeſt the other captaynes of the Gaules. Which newes brought to <hi>Amingus</hi> eares being the other cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Gaules,</hi> And ſeing his companion dead, he confedered with <hi>Auidinus</hi> captaine of the Gothes, &amp; they together came againſt the Romaines (which thing was not vnknowen vnto <hi>Narſetes</hi>) to giue the battaile, neare to <hi>Gaietto</hi> wheras thoſe captaines were conquered and taken alyue. Of whom <hi>Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> was beheaded by the comaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Narſetes:</hi> and <hi>Auidinus</hi> was ſent by him priſoner to the emperoure to Conſtantinople. The captaine <hi>Narſetes</hi> wanne another battaile againſt <hi>Syndual,</hi> king of Brytons, which came into <hi>Italye</hi> with a huge multitude of people to recouer the Realme of <hi>Partinopolis,</hi> which now we call Naples, for he ſayde it apperteyned vnto him of righte, as to one of the lynage of <hi>Hercules,</hi> who in aunciente tyme was kynge of
<pb facs="tcp:21411:42"/>
that Realme. This king <hi>Synduall</hi> within a while became frend vnto <hi>Narſetes,</hi> and behaued him ſelfe outwardly as a frend and confederate: but in ſecrete, conſpired againſt the Romaines, and would haue bene king of the Romay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and rained alone in Italye: through the whiche there ſprange betwene hym and <hi>Narſetes</hi> cruell warres, wherin fortune was a long time variable. For ther is not ſo aduenturous a captaine, to whom in long warres fortune is alwayes proſperous. Finally the king <hi>Syndual</hi> and <hi>Narſetes,</hi> agred to haſard their men, and alſo their liues in one day vnto the diſcrecion of fortune, ſoo that both the armies ioyned together, and fought betwene <hi>Verona,</hi> &amp; <hi>Trento,</hi> wher king <hi>Syndual</hi> was conquered, and taken aliue, and the ſame day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay was hanged openly. And becauſe that <hi>Narſetes</hi> was not accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to vſe ſuch cruelty againſt thoſe that were ouercome, &amp; eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt kings and worthie Knightes, he commaunded his title to be ſet on the gibbet, wheron the kinge hanged, which ſaid this.</p>

                     <p>Such and many other battailes and victories had this aduenturous and good captaine, not only in the borders of <hi>Italye,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where for many yeres he had the gouernement of the country. And as he was a good chriſtian, ſo almighty god in all his affaires did proſper him. After all theſe warres paſt, <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the younger ſent him to the kyngdome of conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, to be chiefe gouernour of al thoſe prouinces, and although he dyd wel in warlike affaires: yet he did much better in the adminiſtracion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. For men that are accuſtomed to trauaile in warres, haue a good lerning howe to gouerne the people in peace. For this occaſion (amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt all mortall men) <hi>Narſetes</hi> was prayſed and eſtemed, that is, for his valy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auntnes in the batailes which he ouercame, for his riches through the ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les that he toke, and for the iuſtice he miniſtred to all men where he ruled. <hi>Narſetes</hi> becauſe he was a <hi>Gretian</hi> borne was enuied of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaines, &amp; chiefly becauſe he dayly encreaſed both his honour and riches.

of long time before had hated <hi>Narſetes,</hi> ſome ſaide it was becauſe he was an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> other thinke it was becauſe he was rich, &amp; ſome other iudge becauſe he was in greater authoritie in the empire then ſhee. Wherfore perceuing ſhe had good occaſion, &amp; oportunitie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, ſhe ſpake a word much to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche: which was this. Sith thou art an <hi>Eunuch Narſetes,</hi> &amp; not a man, it is not fit for the to haue a mans office: therfore, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund the to worke with my handmaidens, and ther thou ſhalt ſerue to ſpin and weaue clothes, <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetes</hi> toke this word heauily, &amp; truly it was w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great ſpight ſpoken. Wherfore he ſtoutly &amp; couragiouſly ſpake vnto the Empreſſe <hi>Sophia</hi> theſe words, &amp; ſaid: I had rather (moſt excellent Princeſſe) thou haddeſt chaſtiſed me as a noble dame, then to haue reproued me w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a word as a ſimple woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but ſince it is ſo that you haue liberty &amp; authoritie to comaund me, know you alſo, that I haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfe ſame to obey you, and therfore I take my leaue, &amp; now I go to weaue my webbe which perhappes your ſelf whileſt you liue, ſhal neuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twine. <hi>Narſetes</hi> immediatly went his way &amp; came into <hi>Italye,</hi> into the citye of Naples (chiefe and head of <hi>Campagnia</hi>) and from thenſe he depeached his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours immediatly to the king of Hungarie (wher the Lumbardes at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time had their manſion place) cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſailing them to forſake that land, ſo euyl tilled, ſo barren, cold and litle, &amp; that they ſhold come &amp; enhabite <hi>Italye,</hi> which was a plaine countrie, fartile &amp; ample, temperat &amp; very riche, and that now or neuer they ſhould conquere it. And <hi>Narſetes</hi> therwith not contented (but to prouoke his frends the more, &amp; make them the more couetous) ſente theym part of euery good thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was in Italy, that is to wete, lyght horſes, riche armour, ſwete pleaſant &amp; dainty fruits, fine mettailes, &amp; many kinds of oynt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments very odiferous, ſilkes &amp; marchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diſes of many &amp; diuers ſortes. The embaſſadors ariued in <hi>Panony</hi> (which now is called <hi>Hungarie</hi>) were honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly receiued, &amp; the Lumbardes ſeing that ther wer ſuche, &amp; ſo many goodly things in <hi>Italie,</hi> determined to leaue <hi>Pannonia,</hi> &amp; go ſpoile &amp; conquere <hi>Italy,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged to Rome, &amp; were at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeaſon frends with the Romaines, yet notwithſtanding they had litle reſpect to this. And hereat no man ought to merueile, for in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place ther is neuer perfite frendſhippe, wher he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to demaund helpe of others. The Lumbards deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to paſſe into <hi>Italy:</hi> &amp; at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time ther was ſene of the <hi>Italians</hi> viſibly in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayer, ſondry armies of fire, the one cruelly killing the other. Whiche thinges greatly feared the hartes of the people. For by this they knew that with in a ſhort ſpace, much of their bloud &amp; of their enemies alſo ſhould be ſhed. For it is an old auncient cuſtome, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when any great matter doth chaunce to anye Realme, firſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> planetes &amp; elements do declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame by ſecret tokens. The ingratitude of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> againſt <hi>Narſetes</hi> his captaine, &amp; the euyll words which <hi>Sophia</hi> ſpake vnto him, wer thoccaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Lumbardes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded, &amp; deſtroyed al <hi>Italy.</hi> which thing valiant Princes ought wel to note, to kepe them ſelues from ingratitude towards their ſeruauntes, who hath don them great ſeruice, For it is a general rule, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ingratitude of a great benefit, maketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruaunts diſpaire of recompence, or of a faithfull ſeruaunt, maketh him become a cruel &amp; mortal enemy. And let not Princes truſt men, becauſe they be natife of their realmes, brought vp &amp; nouriſhed in their pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; alwaies haue bene faithful in their ſeruices, that therfore they wil not
<pb facs="tcp:21411:43"/>
of good ſubiectes be turned to euill, nor yet of faithful become diſloyall. For ſuche imaginacion is vaine. For the Prince that in his doings is vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, cannot keape nor reteyne anye honeſt man longe in his ſeruice. One thynge the noble Iuſtinian did with <hi>Narſetes,</hi> whereof all noble and ſage Princes ought to beware, that is to know, he did not onely giue eare vnto his enemyes and beleued them: but alſo before them he did diſhonour hym, and ſhame him to his power, whiche thinge made him vtterly to diſpaire.</p>
                     <p>For there is nothing that ſpiteth a man more, then to haue before hys ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies any iniurie or diſhonoure done vnto him of his ſuperiour. The empreſſe <hi>Sophia</hi> therfore deſerued great reproche for ſpeakinge ſuche diſhoneſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to <hi>Narſetes,</hi> to ſend him to thread the nedels in that occupacion where the damſels wrought. For it is the duty of a noble princeſſe, to mitigate the ire of Princes when they are angry and not to prouoke them further to anger. <hi>Narſetes</hi> then alwaies dowting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> empreſſe <hi>Sophia,</hi> neuer after retourned into <hi>Naples</hi> where ſhe was, but rather came from <hi>Naples</hi> to Rome, a yeare before the Lumbardes came into <hi>Italy:</hi> where he receiued all the ſacramentes, and like a deuout Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dyed. His body was caried to <hi>Alexandria</hi> in a coffine of ſiluer al ſette with precious ſtones, and ther was buried. And a man cannot tel whither the diſpleaſour were greater that all <hi>Aſia</hi> had not to ſee <hi>Narſetes</hi> aliue, or the pleaſour that <hi>Sophia</hi> had to ſee him deade. For the vnpacient hart (eſpecially of a woman) hath no reſt, vntill ſhe ſee her enemye dead.</p>

But before I ſhew thee the cauſe of my writing, I will reduce into thy memory ſome thinges paſt of our youth, and therby we ſhall ſee what we were then, and what we are now: for no man dothe ſo muche reioyce of his proſperitie preſent, as he whiche calleth to minde his miſeries paſt. Thou ſhalt call to minde (moſt excellent Prince) that we two togethers did learne to reade in <hi>Capua,</hi> and after we ſtudyed a litle in <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum:</hi> and from thenſe we went to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> where I redde Rhethorike, and thou hardeſt philoſophie.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21411:43"/>
and chaunge offices. And in all thoſe iourneis, with the forſe of youth, the ſwete company, with the pleaſaunte communicacion of ſciences, and with a vaine hope we did diſſemble our extreme pouerty, which was ſo great, that many times and ofte we deſired not that whiche manye had, but that litle which to few abounded. Doeſt thou remember, that when we ſayled by the goulfe <hi>Arpin</hi> to goe into <hi>Heleſponte,</hi> a long and tempeſtuous torment came vpon vs, wherin we were taken of a pirate, and for our raunſome he made vs rowe about .ix. monethes in a gally, wheras I cannot tell whiche was greater, either the wante of bread, or the abundaunce of ſtripes whiche we alwaies endured? Haſt thou forgotten alſo that in the citie of Rhodes, when we were beſeged of <hi>Bruerdus,</hi> puiſſaunt kyng of <hi>Epirotes,</hi> for the ſpace of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene monethes, we were tenne withoute eatyng fleſhe, ſaue onely .ii. cattes, the one whiche we ſtole, and the other whiche we bought? remember that thou and I (being in <hi>Tarent</hi>) were deſired of our hoſt to go to the feaſt of the great goddeſſe <hi>Diana:</hi> into the whiche temple none coulde enter that day, but thoſe which were new apparelled. And to ſay the trouthe, we determined not to go thither: thou becauſe thy garmentes were torne, and I becauſe my ſhoes were broken: and that bothe the tymes we were ſicke in <hi>Capua,</hi> they neuer cured vs by dyet: for our dyſeaſes neuer proceded of exceſſe but of extreame hunger. An often times <hi>Retropus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> phiſician, for his pleaſour ſpake to vs in the vniuerſitie and ſayd. Alas children, you dye not through ſurfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and muche eatinge. And truly he ſayde trouth, for the contrey was ſo dere, and our mony ſo ſcarſe, that we did neuer eate vntyl the time we could endure no lenger for famine. Doſt thou not remember the great famine that was in <hi>Capua,</hi> for the which cauſe we were in the warre of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my fleſhe dyd tremble, remembring the great perilles whiche we paſſed in the goulfe of <hi>Theberynthe.</hi> What ſnowes all wynter, what extreme heate all ſommer, what general famine in the fieldes, what outragious peſtilence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the people, and worſte of all, what perſecution of ſtraungers, and what euill will we had of ours? remember alſo that in the citie of <hi>Naples,</hi> when we made our prayer to the profeteſſe <hi>Flauia,</hi> ſhe told vs what ſhoulde become of vs, after we lefte our ſtudies She tolde me that I ſhould be an Emperour, and ſayde that thou ſhouldeſt be a kynge.</p>
                     <p>To the whiche aunſwere we gaue ſuche credite, that we toke it not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye for a mocke: but alſo for a manifeſt iniurye. And nowe I doe not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile, in that then we bothe marueled wonderfull muche. For enuyous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune practiſed her power more in pluckyng downe the ryche, then in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp the poore. Beholde (excellente Prince) the greate power of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, the whele of fortune, &amp; the variety of times: who would haue thought when I hadde my handes all rough and ſcuruy with rowing in the galley, that betwene thoſe handes the ſcepter of the Romayne Empire ſhould haue ben put? who would haue thoughte when I was ſo ſicke for lacke of meat, I ſhould euer haue ſurfited by to muche eating: who would haue thought when I could not be ſatiſfied with cattes fleſhe, that I ſhoulde haue then glutted with to moch dainty meates? who wold haue thought at that time when I left going into the temple becauſe my ſhoes were broken, that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tyme ſhould come when I ſhoulde ryde triumphyng in chariotes, and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:44"/>
vppon the ſhoulders of other menne? who woulde haue thought that that which with my eares I hard of the propheteſſe in <hi>Campagnia,</hi> I ſhould ſee here with my eyes in Rome. O how many dyd hope (at the time we were in <hi>Aſia</hi>) to be gouernours of Rome, and lords of <hi>Sicille,</hi> which not only fayled of the honour that they deſired, but alſo obtayned the death which they neuer feared? for oftentimes it chaunceth to ambitious men, that in their greateſt ruffe, and when they thinke their honoure ſponne and wouen, then their eſtate with the webbe of their lyfe in one moment is broken. If at that time one had demaunded the Tiraunt <hi>Laodicius</hi> (aſpiring to the kingdome of <hi>Sicil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi>) &amp; <hi>Ruphus Caluus</hi> who loked to be Emperour of Rome, what they thought of them ſelues: aſſuredly they wolde haue ſworne their hope to haue bene as certaine, as ours was doubtful. For it is naturall to proude men, to delight them ſelues, and to ſet their hole mynd vpon vaine deuiſes. It is a ſtraunge thing and worthy memory, that they hauing the honour in their eyes fayled of it, &amp; we not thinking therof in our harts ſhould obtaine it. But herein for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhewed her mighte, that ſhe prouided hope for thoſe whiche loked for leaſt: and diſpaire for others that hoped for moſt: which thing greaued them at the very hart. For no pacience can endure to ſe a man obtaine that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out trauaile, which he could neuer compaſſe by much laboure. I cannot tell if I ſhould ſay lyke a ſimple Romaine, that thoſe thinges conſiſt in fortune: or if I ſhould ſay like a good philoſopher, that all the gods do ordeine them. For in the ende, no fortune nor chaunce can do any thing without the gods aſſent. Let the proude and enuious trauaile aſmuche as they will, and the ambicious take aſmuch care as they can, I ſay and affirme, that lytle auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth humaine dilygence to attaine to great eſtates, if the gods be their enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes Suppoſe that euil fortune do ordeine it, or that the god and gods do ſuffer it, I ſee thoſe which haue their thoughtes highe, oftentimes are but of baſe eſtate: and ſo in fine to come to miſchiefe or extreme pouertie, and thoſe that haue their thoughtes low, are humble of hart, and for the more part are greatly exalted by fortune. For many oftentimes dreame that they are lords, and men of great eſtate, which when they are awake, fynd them ſelues ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to all men. The condicion of honor is ſuch, as I neuer read the lyke: and therfore ſuch as haue to do with her, ought to take good hede. For her condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſuch, ſhe enquireth for him whom ſhe neuer ſaw, &amp; ſhe renneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him that flyeth from her, ſhe honoreth him that eſtemeth her not, and ſhe demaundeth him which willeth her not, ſhe geueth to hym that requyreth her not, &amp; ſhe truſteth him whom ſhe knoweth not. Finally honor hath this cuſtome, to forſake him that eſtemeth her: and to remaine with him whych litle regardeth her. The curious trauellers aſke not what place this or that is, but do demaund what way they muſt take to lead them to the place they goe. I meane, that princes &amp; noble men ought not directly to caſt their eyes vpon honour: but in the way of vertue, which bringeth them to honour. For dayly we ſe many remaine defamed, only for ſeking honour: and others alſo exalted and extemed for flying from her. O myſerable world, thou knoweſt I know the wel, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I know of the is: that thou art a ſepulcher of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead, a pryſon of the lyuyng, a ſhop of vyces, a hangeman of vertues, obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of antiquitye, an enemye of thinges preſente, a pitfall to the riche, and a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21411:44"/>
burden to the poore, a houſe of pilgrames, and a denne of theues. Finally O world, thou art a ſclaunderer of the good, a rauenour of the wicked, and a deceuer and abuſer of al, and in the O world, to ſpeake the truth, it is almoſt impoſſible to liue contented, and muche leſſe to lyue in honour. For if thou wilt geue honor to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good, they thnke them ſelues diſhonored, &amp; eſteme thy honour as a thing of mockerie. And if perchaunce they be euyl &amp; light, thou ſuffreſt them to come to honour by way of mockery, meaning infamy and diſhonour vnto them. O immortal gods, I am oftentimes troubled in my thought whoſe caſe I ſhould more lament, eyther y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euyl man auaunced w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out deſerte, or the good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouerthrowen without cauſe. And trulye in this caſe, the pitiful man wil haue compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on them both. For if the euil liue, he is ſure to fal: and if the good fal, we doubt whether euer he ſhall riſe againe. If al falles were alike, al woulde be healed and cured with one ſalue: but ſome fal on their feete, ſome on their ſides, others ſtumble and fall not, and other fal downe right, but ſome do giue them a ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. I meane ſome ther are which fal from their eſtate, &amp; loaſe no more but their ſubſtaunce: others fal, and for very ſorow loaſe not onely their goodes, but their life with all. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ther are that fal, who neither loaſe their life nor goodes, but their honor onely. So according to the diſcrecio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of fortune, the more they haue, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more ſtil he taketh from them, and I greatly muſe why the gods do neuer reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fortune once beginneth to ouerthrow a poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe doth not only take al he hath from hym, but all thoſe which may &amp; wil ſuccoure him.</p>
                     <p>So that the poore man is bound more to lament for another mans euil: then for his owne proper. There is a great dyfference betwene the miſhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of the good, and aduentures of the euill. For of the ill we cannot ſaye that he diſcendeth, but that he falleth: and of the good we may only ſay that he diſcendeth and falleth not. For in the end, the true honour doth not conſiſt in the perfection and dignity that a man hath, but in the good life that he leadeth, It is a miſerie to ſe the vaine men of this worlde, when they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to get any thing, and to compaſſe any great matter of importaunce, to marke their earely ryſing in a morning, their late going to bed at night, and the loke which they caſt vpon other men, to note howe importunate they are to ſome, and how troubleſome they are to others, and afterward (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandinge their longe ſute and great paine) an other man whiche lyttle thought thereof, commeth to that honour reioyſing and without trauaile: which he before by ſo greate paines, and with ſoo greate expenſes of money hath ſought: ſo that in ſeeking honour by trauaile, he commeth to infamye with ſhame. For I my ſelfe haue ſene ſondry things loſt by negligence, and many moe by to much dilygence.</p>

Rome, from thre monethes to thre monethes, to viſite all the lande &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſubiecte to the ſame. For thoſe princes are vniuſt, which haue more care to take vp their rentes, then dyligence to know if their people be well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by iuſtice. Of the informacion taken of the and thy perſonne (if my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory deceyue me not) this was the effect, that thou art temperate in eating, moderate in expenſes, pitiefull to widowes, father to orphanes, gentle to thoſe that ſerue the, pacient with thoſe that offende the, dilygent to kepe and maintaine peace, and faithfull to obſerue league, and thou art accuſed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to be negligent in the ſeruice of God.</p>
                     <p>By one litle gate left open, ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times a great Citie beſieged is loſt: by one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye treaſon, the infinite ſeruices paſt are not eſtemed. I meane (moſt excellent prince) that it litle preuayleth to thinke much of worldly matters, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all deuine ſeruices. For the good Prince ought firſt to ſhut the gates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vices, that they enter not into his ſubiectes: before he doth fortifye the walles againſt his enemyes. Let euery man be as he wil, &amp; ſay what he liſt, I for my part thinke it ſure, that the man whiche is not a ſtudious ſeruer of the goddes, all his vertues ſhalbe turned into vyces, and eſtemed as ſclaunders.</p>
                     <p>For it is a general rule in hye Philoſophie, that a worke is not called ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, becauſe I worke it only, but it is vertuous becauſe it is acceptable to the gods.</p>
                     <p>O excellent prince, doſt not thou know that ther is no man ſo wiſe, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo ſage, but erreth more through ignoraunce, than he doth good by wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? And doſt not thou know that there is no man ſo iuſte, but wanteth much to execute true iuſtice? And finally I ſay that ther is no vertue ſo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, but it wanteth more then it hath to be parfite. Wherfore al our iuſtice ought to be made perfite to the deuine iuſtice: and the vertue which we lack, ought to be ſupplied vnder the great perfection wherwith the gods abound. Amonges vs Romaines we haue this law, (which is the chiefe of al the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers) that here amongeſt mortal men, nor of mortall men, nor with mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men any thinge is perfyte, vnleſſe it be by the Gods confirmed. Synce men are feeble &amp; frayle, it can not be choſen but they ſhould commyt many frayleties. And in ſuch caſe, the ſage Princes ought and ſhould beare with all the frayleties that men commyt, thoſe excepted whych are not iniurious to the gods, whom (if it were poſſible) vnwares ought to be punyſhed.</p>

Thou haſte done one thyng very diſhoneſte (moſte noble Prince) the whiche to wryte vnto thee I am aſhamed, whiche is: for to enlarge thy newe palace, thou haſt plucked downe an olde Temple, the which thing thou ſhouldeſt neither haue done nor yet haue thought. For in the ende, though the ſtones of the temple be of ſmall importaunce, yet the Gods to whome they were dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted were of muche value.

That whiche the ſacred Senate hath ordeyned is, that forthwith thou beginne to buylde the temple a new, and that it ſhould be more large, hye, beautifull, and rycher, then euer it was.

                     <head>¶Howe the Gentils honoured thoſe whiche were deuout in the ſeruice of the Gods. Cap. xix.</head>
                     <p>THE auncient Romayne hiſtoriographers agree, that at the beginninge there were ſeuen kynges, whiche gouerned Rome for the ſpace of .xxiiii. yeares. The ſeconde whereof was named <hi>Pompilius,</hi> who amongeſt all the other was moſte highly eſtemed, for none other cauſe, but for that he was a great worſhipper of the Gods, and a ſumptuous builder of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. For the Romaine princes were as much beloued for ſeruing the gods, as they were honoured for vanquiſhing their enemies. This man was of ſuche ſorte, that he allowed Rome wholy for the Gods, and made a houſe for him ſelfe without the citie. For it was an auncient lawe in Rome, that no man ſhould be ſo bolde to dwell in any houſe conſecrated for the Gods. The fifte kyng of the Romaines was <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus.</hi> And as <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> was vitious and abhorred of the people, ſo was this vertuous and welbeloued of the gods: and was greatlye prayſed in al his doynges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he feared God, and continually viſited the temples, and not contented with thoſe whiche were finiſhed but buylte alſo in the highe Capitoll the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred temple of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> For that no Prince could buylde any houſe in Rome for hym ſelfe, vnleſſe firſte he made a temple for the Gods, of the common wealth. This temple was had in ſo greate reuerence, that as the Romaines honoured <hi>Iupiter</hi> for the God aboue all other Gods, ſo was that temple e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemed aboue al other temples. In the warres betwene the <hi>Faliſques</hi> and the <hi>Carpenates,</hi> two Romaine captaines were vanquiſhed, of the whiche the one named <hi>Gemetius</hi> died: whereupon roſe ſuche a great feare among them, that many flyeng from the warres, came backe agayne to Rome. For the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious hath alwayes this priuiledge, that thoughe they be fewe, yet they are alwayes feared of them that be ouercome. This occaſion moued the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines to choſe newe captaines, and truly they did lyke wyſe men. For of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes it happeneth by alteringe the captaines of the warres, fortune likewyſe chaungeth her doinges. And the captayne that was elected for the warres, was <hi>Marcus Furius Camillus,</hi> who though he were ſtoute and hardy, yet before he went to the warres he offered great ſacrifices to the Gods, and made a vowe that if he returned to Rome victorious, he would buylde a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempne temple. For it was the cuſtome in Rome, that immediatly when the Romaine captaine would enterpryſe to doe any notable thinge, he ſhoulde make a vowe to buylde temples. Nowe when <hi>Camillus</hi> retourned after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes victorious, he did not onely buylde a temple, but alſo furniſhed it with all maner of implementes thereunto belongyng, whiche he gotte by ſpoyle, and vanquiſhing his enemies. And ſithe he was for this reprehendid of ſome, ſaying that the Romaine captaines ſhoulde offer their hartes to the Gods, and deuide the treaſours among the Souldiours, he anſwered theſe wordes. I like a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did aſke the gods but one triumphe: and they like gods gaue me many. Therfore conſidering this, it is but iuſt ſithe I was briefe in promyſinge, that I ſhoulde be large in perfourminge. For euen as I did thanke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that they gaue me double, in reſpect of that I demaunded: ſo likewiſe ſhal thei eſteme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I do giue, in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I promiſed.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21411:46"/>
At that time when the cruel warre was betwixt Rome &amp; the citie of <hi>Neye,</hi> the Romains kept it beſieged fiue yeres togethers, &amp; in thend by policy toke it. For it chaunſeth ſondry times in warre, that that citie in ſhorte time by pollycy is won, which by great ſtrength a long time hath bene defended. <hi>Marcus Furius</hi> dictatour of Rome, &amp; at that time captaine, commaunded a pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clamation to be had through his hoſte, that incontinently after the citie was taken, none ſhould be ſo hardy as to kyll any of the citezens, but thoſe which were found armed. Which thing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies vnderſtanding, vnarmed them ſelues all &amp; ſo eſcaped. And truly this example was worthy of noting. For as the captaines ought to ſhew them ſelues fierce, &amp; cruell at the beginning: ſo after the victory had of their enemies, they ſhould ſhewe them ſelues meke &amp; pitifull. This dictatour <hi>Camillus,</hi> for an other thing he did, was much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded aboue the reſidue. That is to wete, he did not only not conſent to robbe the temples, nor diſhonour the gods: but he him ſelfe with great reuerence, toke the ſacred veſſels of the temples, &amp; the gods which wer therin, (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the goddeſſe <hi>Iuno</hi>) &amp; brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al to Rome. For amongeſt the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes there was a law, that the gods of them which were vanquiſhed, ſhoulde not come by lot to the captaines being conquerours. Therefore he made in the mount <hi>Auentino</hi> a ſumptuous te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, wherin he placed al the gods togethers, with all the other holy reliques which he wan. For the greater triumphe the Romains had ouer their enemies, ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better they ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dled the gods of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people vanquiſhed. Alſo you ought to know, that the Romains after many victories, determined to make a crowne of gold very great and ryche, and to offer it to the god <hi>Apollo.</hi> But ſithe the common treaſour was poore becauſe there was but litle ſiluer, &amp; leſſe gold to make that crown: the Romaine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons defaced their Iewels &amp; ouches of gold &amp; ſiluer to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crown with all. For in Rome there neuer wanted money (if it were demaunded) for the ſeruice of gods, to repaire temples, or to redeme captiues. The Senate eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the well willing hartes of theſe women in ſuch ſort, that they graunted them thre thinges: that is to wete, to weare on their heads garlandes of flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, to go in chariottes to the common places, &amp; to go openly to the feaſtes of the gods. For the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Romains were ſo honeſt, that they neuer ware gold on their heads, neither went thei at any time to the feaſtes vncouered. A man ought not to maruaile, that the Romaines graunted ſuch priuileges vnto the auncient matrones of Rome. For they vſed neuer to be obliuious of any benefite receyued, but rather gentill, with thankes and rewardes to recompence the ſame. An other notable thing chaunſed in Rome, which was that the Romains ſent two tribunes, the which were called <hi>Caulius</hi> &amp; <hi>Sergius,</hi> into the Ile of <hi>Delphos</hi> with great preſentes, to offer vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god <hi>Apollo.</hi> For as <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> ſaith, Rome yerely ſent a preſent vnto the god <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp; <hi>Apollo</hi> gaue vnto the Romaines counſaile. And as the Tribunes went out of the way, they fell into the handes of pirats &amp; rouers on the ſea, which toke them with their treaſours, and brought them to the citie of <hi>Liparie.</hi> But the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens vnderſtanding that thoſe preſentes were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated to the god <hi>Apollo,</hi> did not onely deliuer them all their treaſure againe: but alſo gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much more, and guydes therwith to conduicte them ſafely (both going and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming) from all perill and daunger. The Romaines being aduertiſed of their
<pb facs="tcp:21411:47"/>
gentlenes by the meſſengers, which were come ſafe &amp; aliue, did ſo muche reioyce, that they ordeined in Rome, that the nobles of <hi>Liparie</hi> ſhuld be made Senatours of Rome, &amp; all the others ſhoulde be confederate &amp; of aliaunce vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And they cauſed further that two prieſtes of <hi>Lipari</hi> ſhould always remain in the temple of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> whiche priuilege was neuer graunted to any other ſtraungers but to them only. For the Romaines had ſo great zeale, &amp; loue to their gods, that in the ſeruices of the temples they truſted none, but thoſe which were natiue &amp; auncient of Rome, and alſo were both wyſe and vertuous. When <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> &amp; <hi>Publius Decius,</hi> were in the warres againſt the <hi>Samnites</hi> &amp; <hi>Toſcanes,</hi> and likewyſe againſt the <hi>Vmbres,</hi> many marueilous &amp; terrible ſignes were ſene in Rome, which thinges did not onely feare thoſe that ſawe them, but alſo thoſe which heard of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Vpon which occaſion the Romaines and the Romaine matrones (both night and daye) offered great ſacrifices to the gods. For they ſaide, if we can once pacifie the wrath of the gods in Rome, we ſhall neuer neade to feare our enemies in the fielde. The thing was this, that as the Romaine matrones went viſiting the temples, to appeaſe the ire of the gods, many Senatours wyues came to the temple of chaſtitie to offer ſacrifice. For in the time of the puiſſant power of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, the women did ſacrifice in the temples of the gods. At that tyme came <hi>Virginea,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Aureus Virgineus,</hi> the <hi>Conſul Plebeian,</hi> the which was forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to do ſacrifice, for that ſhe was none of the Senatours wiues but a <hi>Plebeian,</hi> as much to ſaie as a craftes woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; no gentilmans daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter borne. For the noble women were had in ſo great veneration, &amp; ſo highly eſtemed, that al the other ſemed (in reſpect of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) but handmaides, &amp; ſclaues. The noble Romaine <hi>Virginea,</hi> ſeing her to be ſo repulſed &amp; diſdained of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matrons, made of her own propre houſe a ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple to the goddeſſe of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, and with much deuotion &amp; reuerence honoured her. The whiche thing being publiſhed abroade throughout Rome, many other women came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to doe ſacrifice likewiſe. For fortune is ſo variable, that oftentimes thoſe which of pryde haue forbidden vs their houſes, come after by humilitie, to ſerue vs at ours. For this cauſe this <hi>Virginea</hi> the foundreſſe was ſo greatly prayſed, that the Romaines in her life made her patrice (that is a noble Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine) and after her death cauſed her image and ſtatue to be made and ſet vp in the high Capitoll: and aboue this image were grauen certaine Greeke letters, the effecte whereof was this.</p>

ſerue the true God, not in truthe, but with hypocriſie and diſſimulation. Fo the children of this worlde will take no paynes, but for to prouoke the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the body. Many wondred for what occaſion God did ſo muche for them, and they did nothing for God. To this may be aunſwered, that if they had knowen one true God, all the ſacrifices they hadde done to their other gods, they would haue done to him only: and as God is iuſt, ſo he rewarded them in their temporall proſperities, not for that they did well, but for that they deſired to doe well. For in our deuine lawe, God doth not regard what we are, but what we deſire to be. Chriſtian princes maruayle muche what the occaſion ſhould be, that they are not ſo fortunate as the Gentils were. To this may be anſwered, that either they be good or euill. If they be good, truly God ſhould do them wrong, if for the paiment of their faithful ſeruices, he ſhould recompence the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with thoſe worldly vanities. For without doubt one onely louing countenaunce of god in the worlde to come is more worth, then all the temporall goods of this world preſent. But if theſe ſuche great lordes be euil in their perſonnes, ambitious in gouerning their dominions, not pitifull to wydowes and fatherleſſe, not fearfull of god nor of his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges, and moreouer neuer to haue mynde to ſerue him, but only when they ſee them ſelues in ſome great ieopardie, in ſuche caſe God will not heare them, and muche leſſe fauour them. For without doubt the ſeruice is more acceptable, whiche of free wyll proceadeth: than that whiche of neceſſitie is offred.</p>

                     <head>¶For fiue cauſes princes ought to be better Chriſtians then their ſubiectes. Cap. xx.</head>
                     <p>IN myne opinion, Princes ought and are bounde to be vertuous for fiue cauſes. I ſaye vertuous, in that they ſhould loue, and feare God. For he onely may be called vertuous, which in the catholique faith of the church, and in the feare of God hath alwayes remayned conſtant. Firſt, princes ſhould feare, loue, ſerue, and loue one onely god whom they worſhippe, for that thei acknowledge him onely and none other to be the head both of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth. For in the ende there is nothing ſo puiſſaunt, but is ſubiecte to the diuine power. And truly the prince is is great perill of damnation of his ſoule, if in his gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he hath not alwayes before his eies, the feare and loue of the ſupreme prince, to whom we muſt render of all our doynges an acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt. For the prince hath great occaſion to be vicious, thinking that for the vice he ſhall not be chaſtiſed. I haue redde in diuerſe &amp; ſundry writinges, and I neuer founde one auncient prince to be contented with one only god, but that they had &amp; ſerued many gods. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> caried fiue gods painted in a table, and <hi>Scipio</hi> the great caried ſeuen portered in mettall. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more they were not contented to haue many: but yet in ſacrifices, and ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they offred vnto them all. The Chriſtian princes whiche kepe and haue but one very true and omnipotent god, are ſo vnthankefull, that they thinke it muche to ſerue and giue acceptable ſeruice vnto him. And though perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture ſome ſaie, that it is more painefull to ſerue one true god, then all theſe falſe gods, to this I aunſwere. That to ſerue them, it is both trauaile &amp; paine: but to ſerue our god, it is both ioye and felicitie. For in ſeruing thoſe, it is coſtly, and without profite: and in ſeruing God great profite enſueth.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:48"/>
For thoſe goddes require great and ryche ſacrifices, and our God demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nothinge but pure and cleane hartes. Secondarely princes ſhoulde be better Chriſtians then others becauſe they haue more to loſe then all. And he that hath more to loſe then any other, ought aboue al other to ſerue god. For euen as he alone can gyue hym, ſo likewiſe he alone and none other can take from hym. And if a ſubiecte take any thynge from his neighbour, the prince whom he ſerueth maketh him render it agayne: but if the Prince be iniuried with any other tyraunte, he hath none to complayne vnto, nor to demaunde helpe of, but onely of his mercifull God. For in the ende, one that is of power can not be hurt, but by an other that is lykewyſe mighty. Let princes beholde howe the man that wyl make any great aſſaulte, firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth running afarre of as faſt as he can. I meane, that the prynce whiche wyll haue God mercifull vnto him, ought to be content with his onely god. For he in vayne demaundeth helpe of him, to whome before he neuer dyd ſeruice. Thirdly princes ought to be better Chriſtians then others, and this ſhalbe ſeen by that they ſuccoure the poore, prouyde for thoſe that are vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, and viſite the temples, hoſpitalles, and churches, and endeuour them ſelues to heare the diuine ſeruice, and for all theſe thinges they ſhall not onely receiue rewardes, but alſo they ſhal receyue honour. For through their good example, others wyll doe the ſame. Princes not fearinge God, nor his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes, cauſe their Realmes and ſubiectes to fall into great miſery. For if the fountayne be infected, it is vnpoſſible for the ſtreames (that iſſue therof) to be pure. We ſee by experience that a brydell maiſtereth a horſe, and a ſterne ruleth a ſhippe. I meane, that a prynce (good or bad) wyll leade after him all the whole Realme. And if he honour God, all the people doe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe, if he ſerue God, the people alſo ſerue him, if he praiſe God, the ſubiects alſo praiſe him: and if he blaſpheme god, they likewiſe will doe the ſame. For it is vnpoſſible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a tree ſhould bring forth other leaues or fruites, then thoſe whiche are agreable to the humour that are in the rootes Princes aboue all other creatures haue this preeminence, that if they be good Chriſtians, they ſhall not onely receiue merite for their owne woorkes, but alſo for all thoſe whiche others ſhall do, becauſe they are occaſion that the people worke wel. And for the contrarie, they ſhall not onely be puniſhed for the euill whiche they ſhall doe: but alſo for the euill whiche by occaſion of their euill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples others ſhall commit. O ye princes that nowe be aliue, howe greatly do I wyſhe that ye ſhould ſpeake with ſome one of thoſe princes whiche nowe are dead, eſpecially with thoſe that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to the eternall firie flames: then ye ſhould ſee that the greateſt tormentes whiche they ſuffer, are not for the euils that they did commit, but for the euils whiche through their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion were done. For oftentimes princes and prelates ſinne more, becauſe they diſſemble with others, then for that they do committe them ſelues O howe circumſpect ought princes and great lordes to be in that they ſpeake, and howe diligently ought they to examine that whiche they doe. For they ſerue not God onely for them ſelues, but they ſerue hym alſo in generallye for their ſubiectes. And contrariwyſe princes are not only puniſhed for their owne offences, but alſo for the ſinnes of their people. For the ſheaperd ought greuouſly to be puniſhed, when by negligence the rauening woulfe deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

Fourthly princes ought to be better Chriſtians the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, becauſe that to God onely they muſt render accompt of their eſtates, for as muche as we are ſure that god, to whom we muſt render accompte is iuſt, ſo muche the more we ſhould trauaile to be in his fauoure: becauſe whether he finde or not finde in our life any faulte, yet for loue &amp; pities ſake he may correcte vs. Men one with another make their accomptes in this life becauſe they are men, and in the ende counte they well or euill all paſſeth amonges men, becauſe they are men: but what ſhall the vnhappy Princes do, whiche ſhall render no accompte but to God onely, who wyll not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with wordes, corrupted with giftes, feared with threatninges, nor aunſwered with excuſes. Princes haue their Realmes full of cruell iudges, to puniſhe the frailtie of man: they haue their courtes full of aduocates, to pleade againſt them that haue offended: they haue their pallaces full of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, &amp; promoters, that note the offences of other men: they haue throughe all their prouinces auditours, that ouerſee the accomptes of their rentes: and beſides all this, they haue no remembraunce of the day ſo ſtreighte, wherein they muſt render accompte of their wicked life. Me thinkes (ſince all that whiche princes receiue, commeth from the handes of God) that the greateſt parte of the time whiche they ſpend, ſhould be in the ſeruice of God, and all their trade in God, and thei ought to render no accompt of their life but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: then ſithe they are gods in thauthoritie whiche they haue ouer tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall thinges, they ought to ſhewe them ſelues to reſemble god more then others by vertues. For that Prince is more to be magnified, whiche refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth two vices among his people: then he which conquereth .x. realmes of his enemies. But we will deſire them from henceforth they preſume not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more to be gods on the earth, but that they endeuour them ſelues to be good Chriſtians in the common wealth. For all the wealthe of a Prince is, that he be ſtoute with ſtraungers, and louing to his own ſubiectes. Fiftly Princes ought to be better Chriſtians then others. For the proſperitie or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie that chaunceth vnto them, commeth directly from the handes of god onely, and none other. I haue ſeen ſondry times Princes, whiche haue put their whole hope &amp; confidence in other princes, to be on a ſodeine diſcomfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and for the contrary, thoſe which haue litle hope in men, and great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in god, haue alwayes proſpered. When man is in his chiefeſt braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and truſteth moſt to mens wiſedome, then the ſecret iudgement of God ſoneſt diſcomforteth him. I meane, that the confederates &amp; frendes of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might helpe &amp; ſuccour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but god will not ſuffer them to be holpen nor ſocoured, to thend they ſhould ſee that their remedie proceadeth not by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s diligence, but by deuine prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. A prince that hath a realme, doth not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any thing to be done therin without his aduiſe: therefore ſithe god is of no leſſe power in heauen, then princes are on the earth: it is reaſon that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done without his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent, ſins he taketh account of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s deades, &amp; as he is the end of al things, ſo in him, &amp; by him, al thinges haue their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. O Princes, if you knewe howe ſmall a thing it is to be hated of men, and howe great a comfort to be beloued of god, I ſweare that you woulde not ſpeake one worde (although it were in ieſte) vnto men, neither woulde you ceaſe night nor day to commende your ſelues vnto god: for god is more mercifull to ſuccour vs, then we are diligent to call vppon hym.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:49"/>For in concluſion, the fauour whiche men can giue you, other men can take from you: but the fauour that god will giue you, no man can reſiſte it. All thoſe that poſſeſſe muche, ſhould vſe the company of them whiche can doe muche: and if it be ſo, I let you princes wete, that all men can not thynke ſo muche, togethers, as god him ſelfe is able to doe alone. For the crie of a Lyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is more fearefull then the howling of a woulfe. I confeſſe that princes and great lordes maye ſometimes gayne, and wynnne of them ſelfes: but I aſke them whoſe fauoure they haue neade of, to preſerue and kepe them? we ſee oftentymes that in a ſhort ſpace many come to great authoritie, the whiche neither mans wiſedome ſuffiſeth to gouerne, nor yet mans force to kepe. For the authoritie whiche the Romaines in ſixe hundred yeares gayned, fighting againſt the Eothes: in the ſpace of three yeares they loſte. We ſee dayly by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that a man for the gouernement of his owne houſe onely, nedeth the councell of his friendes, and neighbours: and doe princes &amp; great lordes thinke by their owne heades onely, to rule and gouerne many realmes and dominions?</p>

                     <p>The thirde was <hi>Chilo,</hi> who was in the Orient for Embaſſadour of the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth was <hi>Pittacus Quintilenus,</hi> who was not only a philoſopher, but alſo Captaine of the <hi>Mitelenes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fifth was <hi>Cleobolus,</hi> that deſcended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the auncient linage of <hi>Hercules.</hi>

For the whiche victorie Greece was proude, to ſee that their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers were ſo aduenturous in warres, and hardy of their handes: as they were profound in their doctrine, and eloquente in their toungues. And by chaunce one brought him a nomber of women and maydens to ſell, or if he liſted to vſe them otherwyſe at his pleaſure: but this good philoſopher did not defile them nor ſell them, but cauſed them to be apparailed, and ſafely to be conducted to their own natiue countries. And let not this liberalitie that he did be had in litle eſtimation, to deliuer the captiues, and not to defloure the virgins. For many times it chaunſeth, that thoſe whiche are ouercome with the weapons of the conquerours, are conquered with the delightes of them that are ouercome. This deede amongeſt the Grekes was ſo highly commended, and likewyſe of their enemies ſo prayſed, that immediatly the <hi>Metinenſes</hi> ſent Embaſſadours to demaunde peace of the <hi>Prienenſes.</hi> And they concluded perpetuall peace vpon condition, that they ſhoulde make for <hi>Bias</hi> an immortall ſtatue, ſith by his handes and alſo by his vertues, he was the occaſion of the peace and ending of the warres betwene them. And trulye they had reaſon, for he deſerueth more prayſe which wynneth the hartes of the enemies in his tentes by good example: then he whiche getteth the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie in the fielde by ſhedding of bloud. The hartes of men are noble, and we ſee daily, that oftentyme one ſhal ſoner ouercome many by good, then many ouercome one by euyll: and alſo they ſaye, that the Emperour <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſpake theſe wordes. By goodnes the leaſt ſlaue in Rome ſhall leade me tied with a heere whether he wyll: but by euill, the moſt puiſſaunt men in the worlde can not moue me out of Italy. For my harte had rather be ſeruaunt to the good, then Lorde to the euill. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> declareth, that when the citie of <hi>Priene</hi> was taken by enemies &amp; put to ſacke, the wyfe of <hi>Bias</hi> was ſlayne, his children taken pryſoners, his goodes robbed, the citie beaten downe, and his houſe ſet on fire, but <hi>Bias</hi> eſcaped ſafe and went to <hi>Athens.</hi> In this pytiful caſe the good philoſopher <hi>Bias</hi> was no whit the ſadder but rather ſang as he went by the way, and when he perceiued that men marueiled at his mirthe, he ſpake vnto them theſe wordes. Thoſe whiche ſpeake of me for wantinge my citie, my wife, and my children, and loſing al that I had, truly ſuch know not what fortune meaneth, nor vnderſtande what philoſophie is. The loſſe of children and temporall goodes, cannot be called loſſe, if the life be ſafe and the renowne remaine vndefiled. Whether this ſentence be true or no, let vs profoundly conſider, if the iuſt god ſuffer that this citie ſhould come into the handes of the cruell tyrauntes, then this prouiſion is iuſte: for there is no thing more conformable vnto iuſtice, then that thoſe whiche receyue not the doctrine of the Sages, ſhoulde ſuffer the cruelties of the Tyrauntes.</p>
                     <p>Alſo thoughe my ennemies haue kylled my wyfe, yet I am ſure it was not withoute the determynation of the Gods, who after they created her bodye, immediately appoynted the ende of her lyfe.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:50"/>Therfore why ſhould I bewayle her death, ſynce the gods haue lent her life but vntyll this daye? The greate eſtimation that we haue of this life, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that death ſemeth vnto vs ſodayne, and that the lyfe vnwares with death is ouertaken: but theſe are wordes of the children of vanitie, for that by the wyl of the gods, death viſiteth vs, and againſt the wylles of men, lyfe forſaketh vs. Alſo my chyldren be vertuous philoſphers, and albeit they be nowe in the handes of tyrauntes, we oughte not therefore to call them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, for a man may not call him a captiue whiche is laden with irons: but him whiche is ouerwhelmed with vices. And although the fire haue burnt my houſe, yet I knowe not why I ought to be ſad, for of truthe it was now olde, and the wynde did blowe downe the tyles, the wormes did waſte the woode, and the waters that ran downe periſhed the walles, and it was old and lyke to fall, and perchaunce would haue done greater diſpleaſure. For moſt commonly, enuy, malice, and olde houſes, ſodainely without any war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or knocking at the doore aſſaulteth menne: finally there came the fire whiche quited me of many troubles. Firſt of the trouble that I ſhould haue had in repairing it, ſecondarely it ſaued me money in pluckinge it downe, thirdly it preſerued me and myne heires from muche coſte and many daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. For oftentimes that whiche a man conſumeth in repayring an olde houſe, would with auauntage by hym a newe. Alſo thoſe whiche ſaye that for the taking away of my goodes, I lacke the goodes of fortune, ſuch haue no reaſon ſo to thinke or ſaye. For fortune neuer geueth temporall goodes for a proper thing, but to thoſe whome ſhe liſt, and when ſhe will diſpoſe them: therfore when fortune ſeeth that thoſe men whome ſhe hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as her diſtributers, doe hourde vp the ſame to them and to their heires: then ſhe taketh it from them to geue it to an other. Therefore by reaſon I ſhould not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playne that I haue loſt any thing: for fortune recommendeth vnto an other the temporall goodes: but I cary pacience and Philoſophie with me, ſo that they haue diſcharged me from all other, and haue no more charge but for my ſelfe alone. <hi>Laertius</hi> declareth in his fift boke of the ſayings of the Gretians. That this <hi>Bias</hi> determined to goe to the playes of <hi>Mounte Olimpus,</hi> whereunto reſorted people of all nations: and he ſhewed hym ſelfe in this place of ſo highe an vnderſtanding, that he was counted ſupreame and chiefe of all other philoſophers, and wonne the name of a true philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. Other philoſophers then beinge in the ſame playes <hi>Olimpicalles,</hi> aſked him many queſtions of ſondry matters, whereof I wyll make mention here of the chiefeſt.</p>

                        <p>THe firſt queſtion was this. Tell me who is the vnhappieſt man in the worlde? <hi>Bias</hi> aunſwered. He is moſte vnhappy that is not paciente in aduerſities. For men are not killed with the aduerſities they haue: but with the impacience whiche they ſuffer.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond was, what is moſt hardeſt &amp; troubleſome to iudge? he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

                        <p>The third was, what is moſte hardeſt to meaſure? whereunto <hi>Bias</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.

Ther is nothing that needeth more circumſpection then the meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of time: for the time ſhold be meaſured ſo iuſtly, that by reaſon no time ſhould want to do wel, nor any time ſhould abound to do euill. The fourth was, what thing is that that nedeth no excuſe in the accompliſhment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? <hi>Bias</hi> anſwered the thing that is promiſed muſt of neceſſity be parformed. for otherwiſe he that doth loſe the creadite of his word, ſhoulde loſe more then he that ſhould loſe the promiſe to him made. The 5 was, what thinge that is wherin the men aſwell good as euill ſhould take care? <hi>Bias</hi> aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, men ought not in any thinge to take ſo greate care, as in ſekinge coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle, and counſelours: for the proſperous times cannot be maintayned, nor the multitude of enemyes reſiſted, if it be not by wiſe men and graue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayles. The ſixte was, what thing that is wherin men are praiſed to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent? he aunſwered: in one thinge only men haue lycence to be neglygente, and that is in choſing of frendes. Slowly ought thy frendes to be choſen, and they neuer after for any thing ought to be forſaken. The ſeuenth, what is that which the afflyeted man doth moſt deſire? <hi>Bias</hi> aunſwered. It is the chaunge of fortune: and the thing which the proſperous man doth moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, is to thinke that fortune is mutable. For the vnfortunate man hopeth for euery chaunge of fortune to be made better, and the wealthye man fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth through euery chaunge to be depriued of hys houſe.

For Chriſte thinketh him ſelfe as much iniuried of thoſe, whiche perſecute his church: as of thoſe that laide handes on his perſone, to put him to death. We rede that in times paſt god ſhewed ſondry greuous and cruel puniſhmentes, to diuerſe high lordes and princes, beſides other famous and renowmed men. But ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour had neuer ſuch power in his hande, as it had againſt thoſe whiche ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the infamed Idoll, and violated the ſacred temples. For to god this is the moſt heinous offence, to forſake the holy catholike faith in his life, and to diſpaire in his mercy at the houre of his death. Woulde to god we had ſo much grace to acknowledge our offences, as god hath reaſon to puniſhe our ſinnes. For if it were ſo, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we would amend in time to come, &amp; god would graunt vs a generall pardon for al that is paſt. I ſee one thing wherin (as I thinke) I am not deceiued, which is this: that the frailnes &amp; miſeries which we commit we thinke them naturall, and in the ſatiſfaction and amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame we ſay they are ſtraunge: ſo that we admit the fault, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>demne the paine which therby we do deſerue. The ſecret iudgements of god do ſuffer it, and our offences do deſerue it: I do not deny but that the euyll may hold &amp; poſſeſſe this life at their pleaſour: but I ſweare vnto them, when they ſhal leſt thinke of it, they ſhal loſe their life to their great diſpleaſour: for the pleaſurs of this life are ſo vnconſtant, that we ſcarce begin to taſte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when they vade out of their ſight. It is a rule infallible, whiche bothe of the good &amp; euill hath bene proued: that all naturally deſire rather to abound than to want: and all that which greatly is deſired, with great dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is ſerched, and through great trauaile is obteined: and that thing which by trauaile is attained, with loue is poſſeſſed, &amp; that which by loue is poſſeſſed, with much ſorow is loſt, bewailed, &amp; lamented. For in thend we can not deny, but that the watry eies do manifeſtly ſhewe the ſorowfull hartes. To the fine wittes and ſtout harts this is a continuall torment, and endleſſe paine, &amp; a worme that alway gnaweth: to cal to mind that he muſt loſe the ioyfull life, whiche ſo entierly he loued: and taſte the fearfull death, whiche ſo greatly he abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Therfore to proue this matter, which I haue ſpoken of before, it is but reaſon that princes know, if they do not know, that euen as the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence exalteth them to high eſtates, they not deſeruing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſo likewiſe his rigorous iuſtice will bring them to nought, if they be vnthankeful for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites. For the ingratitude of benefittes receiued, maketh the man not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receiue any mo. The more a man through benefits is bound, the more greuous puniſhment (if he be vnthankefull) he deſerueth. Al wyſe men ſhuld finde (if thei apply their mindes therunto) that in chaſtiſing god calleth thoſe offences firſt to his mind, which are furtheſt from the thoughtes of men. For before the tribunal of god, our ſecret faultes are alwaies caſting out bloud, to thend he ſhould execute of our perſons open iuſtice. And further I ſaie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:52"/>
in this caſe I doe not ſee that the prince is exempted more, though he liue in great felicitie: than the poore labourer, who liueth in extreme miſery. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we ſee it eftſones by experience, that the ſodaine lightning, tempeſtes and the terrible thonder, forſaketh the ſmall &amp; lowe cotages, &amp; battereth forthwith the great &amp; ſumptuous buildinges. Gods wil &amp; determination is, that for as much as he hath exalted them aboue al others, ſomuch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him for lorde aboue all others: For god did neuer create high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates becauſe they ſhould worke wickednes: but he placed them in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to thend they ſhould therby haue more occaſion to do him ſeruice. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prince that is not a good Chriſtian, a feruente louer of the catholike faith, nor will haue any reſpect to the deuine ſeruice: let him be aſſured that in this world he ſhall loaſe his renowme, and in the other he ſhall hazarde his ſoule. For that all euill Chriſtians are the pariſhioners of hell.</p>

For in thend, the hartes of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ſtirred more through ſome litle examples, then with a great multitude of words. In the firſt booke of the <hi>Leuitici,</hi> the .x. chap is declared, how in the time of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> the ſonne in law of <hi>Iethro</hi> prieſt (that was of <hi>Media</hi>) who was chiefe prince of all the image of <hi>Seph,</hi> with whom the brother of <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Iepre</hi> had charge of the high prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod. For among al the lawes where god at any time put his handes vnto, he prouided always that ſome had the gouernement of ciuile affaires: and others thadminiſtration of the deuine miſteries. This high prieſt had then two children, whoſe names were <hi>Nadab,</hi> &amp; <hi>Abihu,</hi> which two were yonge &amp; beautiful, ſtout &amp; ſage, &amp; during their infancy ſerued their father, &amp; helped him to do ſacrifice. For in the old law they ſuffred that prieſtes ſhould not onely haue wiues &amp; children: but alſo that their children ſhould ſuccede the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their temples, and inherite their benefices. There came a great miſchaunce, for the two childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being apparailed in whyte, their bodies bound with ſtoels, their handes naked, in one hand holding a torche, &amp; in thother the ſenſer, being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent to light the new fyre, &amp; contrary to that the law had ordeined, &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king coles which were prohibited, a marueilous thing was ſene in the ſight of the people, which was, that ſodainly theſe two children fel flat on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth dead, &amp; al their ſacrifice burned.

It chaunced that the <hi>Azotes</hi> made warre againſt the <hi>Paleſtines,</hi> and were a kynde of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> ſtoute,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:21411:52"/>
and warrelyke: the whiche fought ſo couragiouſly, that the <hi>Paleſtines</hi> and Hebrues were conſtrayned to bringe their Arke into the middes of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile: whiche was a relicke (as a man ſhould haue put the holy ſacrament) to deuide a great multitude of people. But fortune ſhewed her countenaunce vnto them ſo frowningly, that they were not onely ouercome, but alſo were ſpoyled of the Arke, whiche was their chiefe relicke. And beſides that, there were .400. <hi>Paleſtines</hi> ſlayne. The <hi>Azotes</hi> caried awaye the Arke ful of relicks vnto their temple, in the citie of <hi>Nazote,</hi> and ſet it by <hi>Dagon</hi> their curſed Idol. The true God (whiche wyll not ſuffer any to be coequall with him in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, or in any thing that he repreſenteth) cauſed this Idoll to be ſhaken, throwen downe, and broken in pieces no man touching it. For our god is of ſuche power, that to execute his iuſtice he nedeth not worldly helpe. God not contented thus (though the Idoll was broken in pieces) cauſed thoſe to be puniſhed likewyſe whiche worſhipped it, in ſuche ſorte that all the people of <hi>Azote, Aſcalon, Geth, Acharon,</hi> and of <hi>Gaza</hi> (whiche were fiue auncient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed cities) were plaged both man and woman inwardly with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of the <hi>Emerodes,</hi> ſo that they could not eate ſitting, nor ryde by the wayes on horſebacke. And to thende that al men might ſee that their offences were greauous (for the puniſhment they receiued by the deuine iuſtice) he repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed their houſes, places, gardeins, ſeedes, and fieldes full of rattes. And as they had erred in honouring the falſe Idoll, and forſaken the true god, ſo he would chaſtiſe them with two plagues, ſending them the <hi>Emerodes</hi> to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their bodies, and the rattes to deſtroye their goodes. For to him that willingly geueth his ſoule to the deuill, it is but a ſmall matter that god (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his wyll) depriue him of his goodes. This then being thus, I would nowe gladly knowe, whether of them committed moſte offence, eyther the <hi>Azotes</hi> whiche ſet the Arke in the temple, whiche (as they thought) was the moſte holieſt: or the Chriſtians, whiche (without the feare of God) robbe and pylle the Churche goodes to their owne priuate commoditie in this worlde. Truly the lawe of the <hi>Azotes</hi> differed as muche from the Chriſtians, as the offence of the one differeth from the other. For the <hi>Azotes</hi> erred not, beleuing that this Arke was the figure of the true God, but we beleue it, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe it, and without ſhame committe againſt it infinite vices. By this ſo rare &amp; ſodaine a puniſhement, me thinkes that Princes and great Lordes ſhould not onely therfore acknowledge the true god, but alſo reuerence and honour thoſe thinges which to him are dedicated. For mans lawes (ſpeaking of the reuerence of a Prince) doe no leſſe condemne him to die, that robbeth his houſe: then him whiche violently layeth handes on his perſone.</p>

                           <hi>DArius</hi> kyng of the <hi>Perſes</hi> and <hi>Medes</hi> beſieged the auncient citie of <hi>Babilon</hi> in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> wherof <hi>Balthaſar</hi> ſonne of <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great was kinge and lorde. Who was ſo wicked a childe, that his father being dead, he cauſed him to be cut in .300. pieces, &amp; gaue him to .300. haukes to be eaten, becauſe he ſhould not reuiue againe to take the goodes and riches from him which he had left him. I knowe not what father is ſo foliſhe, that letteth his ſonne liue in pleaſures, &amp; afterwardes the intrelles of the hauke wherewith the ſonne hauked, ſhould be the wofull graue of the father, which ſo many men lamented. This <hi>Balthaſar</hi> then being ſo beſieged, determined one night to make a great feaſt and banket to the lordes of his realme that came to ayde him, and in this he did like a valiaunt and ſtoute prince, to thende the <hi>Perſes</hi> and <hi>Medes</hi> might ſee that he litle eſtemed their power. The noble and high hartes do vſe when they are enuironed with many trauayles, to ſeeke occaſions to inuent pleaſours: becauſe to their men they may giue greater courage, and to their enemies greater feare.

then the ſtones of <hi>Tarentine</hi> are to be beaten downe. But retourninge to king <hi>Balthaſar.</hi> The banket then being ended, and the greateſt parte of the night ſpent, <hi>Balthaſar</hi> the kyng being very well pleaſed that the banket was made to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentation (though he was not the ſobreſt in drynking wyne) commaunded all the cuppes of golde and ſiluer with the treaſour he had, to be brought and ſet on the table, becauſe all the bidden geſtes ſhoulde drinke therin. King <hi>Balthaſar</hi> did this, to that ende the princes and lordes with all his captaines, ſhoulde manfully helpe him to defende the ſiege, and alſo to ſhewe that he had muche treaſour to pay them for their paynes. For to ſaye the truthe, there is nothing that encourageth men of warre more, than to ſee their rewarde before their eies. As they were drinking merily (at the banket) of theſe cups which <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> had robbed from the temple of Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ſodenly by the power of God and the deſerte of his offences, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a hand in the wal without a body or arme, which with his fingers wrote theſe wordes. <hi>Mane, Thetel, Phares,</hi> which ſignifieth. O kinge <hi>Balthaſar,</hi> god hath ſene thy life, and findeth that thy malice is nowe accompliſhed. He hath commaunded that thou and thy realme ſhoulde be wayed, and hath found y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther lacketh a great deale of iuſt weight, wherfore he comaundeth, that thy life for thine offences be taken from thee: and that thy realme bee put into the handes of the <hi>Perſes</hi> and <hi>Medes,</hi> whiche are thine enemies. The viſion was not fruſtrate, for the ſame night without any lenger delay, the execution of the ſentence was put in effect by the enemies. The king <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> died, the realme was loſt, the treaſours were robbed, the noble men take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and al the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> captiues.

How wicked ſo euer <hi>Balthaſar</hi> was, yet he neuer chaunged, gaue, ſold, nor engaged the treaſours of the Sinagoge: but wat ſhall we ſay &amp; ſpeake of prelates, whiche without any ſhame, waſt, chaunge, ſell, and ſpende the churche goodes. I take it to be leſſer offence, to giue drinke in a chalice as king <hi>Balthaſar</hi> did to one of his concubines: then to enter into the churche by ſymony, as many do nowe a daies. This tyraunt was ouercome more by folie, than by couetouſnes: but theſe others are van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed with foly, couetouſnes, and ſimony. What meaneth this alſo, that for the offence of <hi>Nabuchodonoſor</hi> in Hieruſalem, his ſonne <hi>Balthaſar</hi> ſhoulde come and be puniſhed. For this truly me thinke not conſonaunt to reaſon, nor agreable to mans lawe: that the father ſhould commit the theft, and the ſonne ſhould requite it with ſeuen double. To this I can aunſwere: that the good child is bounde to reſtore all the good that his father hath lefte him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill gotten.

young of yeares but yonger of vnderſtanding, and was nombred among the wicked kings: not onely euil, but to euil: for the ſcriptures vſe to cal them by names infamed, whoſe liues deſerued no memorie. The vices of this kyng <hi>Ahab</hi> were ſondry and diuerſe, whereof I wyll declare ſome as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after foloweth.

Secondarily this kyng <hi>Ahab</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the daughter of the kynge of the <hi>Idumeans,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> whiche was of the ſtocke of the Gentyls, and he of the Hebrues.

This <hi>Manaſſes</hi> was a wicked Prince, for as muche as he builte new temples to <hi>Baal,</hi> and in the cities made heremitages for the Idols, and in the mountaines repayred all the aulters that heretofore were conſecrated to the deuyll. He conſecrated many foreſtes and woodes to the Idols, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the ſtarres as the gods, and did ſacrifice to the planets &amp; elementes. For the man that is abandoned by the hand of God, there is no wickednes that his obſtinate harte doth not enterpriſe. So that he had in his Palace al maner of falſe prophetes, as ſouthſaiers, propheſiers, witches, ſorcerers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunters, &amp; coniurers, the which daily he cauſed to giue ſacrifice to the idols: &amp; gaue ſuch credit to ſorcerers, &amp; enchaunters, that his ſeruauntes were all
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21411:54"/>
for the moſt part ſorcerers, and in them was his chiefe delight and pleaſure. And lykewiſe he was ſkilful in all kinde of miſchiefe, and ignoraunte in all vertues. He was ſo cruel &amp; ſpilt ſomuch innocent bloud, that if it had bene water put together and the bodyes of them that he ſlewe layde on heapes, it would both haue couered their carcaſes and alſo haue drowned the liuing Yet he not contented with that I haue ſpoken of, ſet in the Temple of oure Lorde an old idoll that ſtode in the woode, for the puniſhmente of whiche facte, God ſuffred his ſeruauntes to kill his eldeſt ſonne. Afterwarde God would not ſuffer theſe ſuch ſondrye myſcheues of mans malice, but of hys deuine iuſtice cauſed theſe wordes to be proclamed in <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> Sithe the king <hi>Manaſſes</hi> hath bene ſo bold to contemne me, &amp; himſelfe alone to commit thoffences of al, I wil chaſtice him alone withe the ſame correction that he hath ſhewed vnto others. By theſe wordes let Princes note here, howe the deuine vengeaunce extendeth no further, then our offences deſerue: ſoo that if our fault be lytle, the puniſhment which he giueth vs is very tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but if the prince be ſtubburne and obſtinate in his wyckednes, let hym be ſure that the puniſhment ſhalbe extreme.</p>

                     <p>WHen <hi>Iulian,</hi> the Apoſtate was Emperour of Rome, he ſente to conquere <hi>Hongarie,</hi> of no iuſt title hee had to it, more then of Ambicion to vnite it, to the Romaine Empire. For tyrannous princes vſe all their force to vſurpe others realmes by crueltye, and lytle regard whether they maye do it by iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And becauſe the Romaine Empire was of great force, this Ambicious Emperour <hi>Iulian,</hi> had in that warres a mighty and puyſant Armie, which did wonderfull muche harme throughe al the countryes they came. For the fruites of warres is, to bereue the enemyes of lyfe, and to ſpoyle the men of their goodes. It chaunſed one day as. 5 knyghtes wente out of the campe to make a rode, they found a young man that caried a halter in hys hande, and as they would haue taken it awaye from hym to haue tyed their horſes to let them feede, he was ſo hardy and ſtout that he defended hym ſelfe from them all: ſo that he had more ſtrength alone then they fyue altogethers, The Romayne knyghtes amazed to ſee this younge man defend hym ſelfe from
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21411:55"/>
them all ſo ſtoutly, very inſtauntly deſired him to go to the Romaine campe with them, and they promiſed him he ſhould haue great interteynment. For the Romaines were ſo dyligent, that they woulde omit no good thinge for want of money, ſo that it wer for the publike weale. This yonge man was called <hi>Gracian,</hi> and was borne and brought vp in the country of <hi>Pannonia,</hi> in a citie they called <hi>Cibata:</hi> his lynage was not of the loweſt ſort of the people, nor yet of the moſt eſtemed Citizens, but were men that lyued by the ſwete of their browes, and in loue of the common people. And truly it is no ſmall benefite that God had made him of a meane eſtate: for to be of baſe linage, maketh men to be deſpiſed and not regarded: and to come of a noble bloud and high ſynage, maketh men to be proud and lofty. This yonge man being come into the Romaynes campe, the fame was immediatly ſpred, how that he alone had vanquiſhed fiue knyghtes. And his ſtrength and courage was ſo highely eſtemed, that wythin a while after he was made Pretour of the armie. For the Romaynes, not according to fauour, but according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytie of men, deuyded the offices and degrees of honoure in warres. Tyme therfore working his nature, and manye eſtates beinge decayed, after thys yonge <hi>Gracian</hi> was made Pretour of the armye, and that he was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tryed in the warres, fortune, which many times bringeth that to paſſe in a day: that mans malyce cannot in many yeres, raiſed this <hi>Gracian</hi> to be Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure of Rome. For trulye one hower of good ſucceſſe is more worthe, thenne al worldly fauour.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Gracian</hi> was not onlye ſinguler in ſtrengthe, couragious in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, fortunate in all his affaires: but alſo he was luckye of children. That is to wete, he had two ſonnes which were Emperours of Rome, the one was called <hi>Valente,</hi> the other <hi>Valentinian.</hi> In this caſe the children mighte glorye to haue a father ſo ſtout: but the glorie of the father is greater to haue ſonnes of ſuch nobilytie. For there is no greater felicitie in this world, then duringe life, to come to honour and riches: &amp; after death, to leaue good children to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy them. The eldeſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two ſonnes was the Emperour <hi>Valente,</hi> who ruled in the Orient for the ſpace of .iiii. yeres, &amp; was the xxxix. Emperour of Rome, from <hi>Iulius Ceſar:</hi> though ſome do beginne at the time of <hi>Octauian,</hi> ſayeng that he was vertuous, and that <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> vſurped the Empire lyke a tiraunt. This <hi>Valente</hi> was beautifull of perſonne, but poore of vertues: ſo that he was more beautifull thenne vertuous, more couragious thenne mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, more riche thenne charitable, more cruell then pitefull. For there are manye Princes, that are verye expert to deuiſe newe orders in a common wealthe: but there are few that haue ſtoute hartes to put the ſame in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. In thoſe dayes the ſect of <hi>Arrian</hi> the curſed heretike floriſhed, and the Emperour <hi>Valente</hi> was greatly blinded therin: in ſomuch that he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fauour the <hi>Arrians.</hi> but alſo he perſecuted the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which was ſhewed for ſomuch as he killed &amp; cauſed to be killed (for that occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) many lay men, &amp; toke many clerkes, &amp; baniſhed many Biſhopps, ouerthrew many Churches, robbed the goods of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chriſhia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; dyd infinite other miſcheues in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comon wealth, For the prince whych is infected wyth hereſy, &amp; liueth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of the Church, ther is neyther miſchiefe nor treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but he wil comit. In the deſertes of Egipte in the mountaynes of <hi>Armenia</hi> and in the cityes
<pb facs="tcp:21411:56"/>
of <hi>Alexandrie,</hi> there was a greate multitude of fryers and relygious men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt whom were many wiſe men, and pure of lyfe, conſtant in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Church, and pacient in perſecutions. For he is a true relygious man, that in tyme of peace is charitable to teache the ignorant: and bold in the time of <hi>Sciſmes,</hi> to confound the heretyques. The Emperour <hi>Valente</hi> was not only not a frend to the <hi>Arrians,</hi> &amp; an enemye to the Chriſtians, but alſo he was a perſecutour of the deuoute and religious fryers. For he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded proclamacyons, to be had through all his realmes and domynions, that all the relygious that were yonge in yeares, hole of their bodyes, and ſound of their lymmes, ſhould immedyately caſt of their cowles and hoodes, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng their monaſterye, and take ſouldiers wages in the campe. For he ſaid Monaſteryes were inuented for nothynge els, but to maintaine thoſe that were deformed, blynde, lame, and maymed, and vppon this occaſion he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed great tyrannye. For many monaſteryes were left naked, many notable conſtitucions were broken, manye hermites were martyred, manye friers whypped, many notable barons banyſhed, and many good men robbed of their goodes. For the vertuous men deſired rather the bytter lyfe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery: then the ſwete and pleaſaunt lybertie of the world. This Emperour yet not contented with theſe thinges, as by chaunce his wife commended vnto him the beautye of a Romaine called <hi>Iuſtina,</hi> without any more delaye he maried her, not forſaking hys firſt wyfe, and immedyatly made a lawe throughout all his Empire, that without incurring any daunger, eche Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian myght haue two wyues, and mary with them by the lawe of matry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. For the tyrannous Princes (to cloake their vyces) make and enſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyſhe the lawes of vices. The ſhame was not litle that the Emperoure <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lente</hi> (againſt the commaundement of the Churche) would marie wyth two women at one time: but the leſſe ſhame he had, the greater was his iniquy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye to put it in excucion, and to cauſe it to be publyſhed through hys realme as a law. For a perticuler vyce corrupteth but one alone, but a general law diſtroyeth al. At that tyme the puiſſaunt Gothes were in the parties of the orient, the whych were in feates of armes very valyaunt and couragious: but in thynges of faith they were euyl broughte vp, althoughe the greateſte part of them were baptyſed. For then the Churche was very poore of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, howbeit thoſe that they had were very notable men. After the Gothes were baptyſed, and the furie of the warres ſomewhat appeaſed, they ſente Embaſſadours to the Emperour <hi>Valente,</hi> deſyring hym that immedyatlye and forthwith he would ſende them holy &amp; catholyke Biſhoppes, by whoſe doctrine they myght be inſtructed and brought to the chriſtian fayth. For it was thought that the Emperoures of Rome coulde haue no byſhoppes in their countryes: vnleſſe they were vertuous. This wicked Emperour ſythe he was now entangled with hereſye, and that he had peruerted the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the good Emperours (that is for hauing about hym euil Biſhoppes) as he was enuyronned with all euills and myſcheues, ſo he ſent to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes a biſhoppe called <hi>Eudoxius,</hi> the whych was a ranke <hi>Arrian,</hi> and brought with hym many Biſhoppes which were heretyques, by the whych the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Princes of the Gothes were <hi>Arrians,</hi> for the ſpace of 200 yeares.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:21411:56"/>The catholyke Princes ought to take great care to watch, and in watching to be ware and circumſpect, that they, their Realmes, neyther their ſubiects, ſhould in their time be defiled with hereſie. For the plague of heretykes and hereſyes is not of lyght occaſion banniſhed the place, wher ons it hath reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. We haue declared of the ſmall fayth that thys Emperoure had in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, and of the greate myſcheues he dyd to the Churche. Let vs now ſee what was the ende of hys myſerable life. For the man of wycked lyfe ſeldome commeth to good ende. The matter was this, that as the Gothes were dryuen out of the Realme by ſome of the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> they came immedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the Realme of <hi>Thracia,</hi> which then was ſubiecte to the Romaynes. And the Emperour <hi>Valente</hi> without anye couenaunte receyued theym into hys lande, wherin he commytted great folye, and vſed lytle wiſedome. For it is a generall rule, wher rebelles, vacabondes, and ſtraungers come to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habyte, there alwayes the Realme and dominions is deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>The Gothes remayned certaine yeres amonge them without any diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion or quarrellynge againſt the Romaynes: but afterwardes through the couetouſnes of <hi>Maximus</hi> chiefe Captaine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaines, that denied the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes of their prouyſion, whyche ſo longe tyme remayned frendes, aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene them ſo cruell warres, that it was the occaſion of the loſſe and vtter vndoing both of Rome and of all <hi>Italye.</hi> For truly ther is no enmetye doth ſo much hurte, as that of frendes when they fawle out once at dyſcorde. The warre now being kindeled, the Gothes were ſcatered throughe the Realme of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and they left no forte but they battered, they came to no villagyes nor cytyes but they ſacked, they toke no women but they forced, they entred into no houſe but they robbed. Finally the Gothes in ſhort time ſhewed the poyſon that they had agaynſt the Romaynes. And let no man maruel that the Gothes committed ſo many cruell and heynous factes, ſith we that are Chryſtians do commyt dayly greater offences. For among rebelles it is a common errour, that that whyche they robbe in the warres, they ſaye they are not bound to reſtore in peace. The Emperour <hi>Valente</hi> was then in the cytie of <hi>Antioche,</hi> and ſith he had aſſembled there a great army, &amp; had greate ayde out of Italy, he determyned hymſelfe in perſon to go into the campe of the Romaynes, and to gyue thonſet againſt the Gothes, wherin he ſhewed himſelfe more bold then wiſe. For a Prince in battaile can doo no more then one man, nor fighte more then one man, and if he die, he is the occaſion of the death and deſtruction of them all. When both the hoſtes of the Romay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and the Gothes ioyned, ther was betwene theym a cruell and mortall fight: ſo that in the firſt brunt the Gothes ſhewed them ſelues ſo valiaunte, that they put to flight the Romaines horſemen, leauing their fotemen alone in great ieopardy, the which in ſhort ſpace after were diſcomfited and ſlaine not one left aliue. For the barbarous ſware that that day the Gothes ſhould al dye, or els vtterly they would deſtroy the name of the Romaynes. And in this firſt charg y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour <hi>Valente</hi> was mortally wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded who perceiuing he had his deaths wound &amp; that the battaile was loſt, he determined to fire and ſaue himſelfe. But when fortune beginneth to perſecute anye man, ſhe leaueth hym not vntill ſhe ſe him dead, or beaten downe without reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:57"/>
Therfore as this wicked Emperour (thincking to ſaue himſelfe) came into a ſhepecotte, the enemyes ſeyng him, in the end ſet fier on the ſhepecote, and burnt him alyue. So in one day he loſt his perſon, his lyfe, his honoure, and his empire. It is mete that princes and great lordes ſhould lift vp their eyes to conſyder well thys hiſtorie of <hi>Valente,</hi> that they ſtraye not from the Catholicke, Churche, that they dyſhonour not Gods myniſters, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne hereſyes. For as this accurſed Emperoure <hi>Valente</hi> for his wicked do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges was condignely puniſhed by the hands of the almighty God: So let them be aſſured, the ſelfe ſame god wil not pardon their offences.

                           <hi>I Valentinian</hi> and <hi>Valent</hi> were brethrene, and the eldeſt of them was <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian,</hi> who ſucceded in the Empire (after the death of his father) to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the armies. For amonges the Romaines there was a lawe in vre, that if the father died in the fauour of the people, of right the ſonne without any other demaunde was heire. This <hi>Valentinian</hi> was a luſty yong man, of a ſanguine complection, and of his body well ſhaped, and aboue al he was a good Chriſtian, and of all the people generallye welbeloued: For nothynge adorneth the noble man more, then to be counted ciuill and corteous of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauior. At that time wher the Emperoure <hi>Iulian</hi> perſecuted moſte the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>Valentinian</hi> was pretor of the armies, and when <hi>Iulian</hi> was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that <hi>Valentinian</hi> was a chriſtian, he ſent vnto him and bad hym do ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the idols of the Romaine Emperour, or els to forſake the office of his pretorſhip. <hi>Iulian</hi> would gladly haue killed <hi>Valentinian,</hi> but he durſt not: For it was a law inuiolable amonges the Romaynes, that no citizen ſhould be put to death without decre of the <hi>Senate. Valentinian</hi> receyuing the meſſage of this Emperour <hi>Iulian</hi> aduertiſed of his will, (which was to renownce his faith or to leaue his office) he dyd not only reſigne his office but therwithal forgaue the Emperour all the money he ought him for arreragies of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce. And becauſe he woulde lyue with a more quyete conſcience, he wente from Rome into a cloyſter, where he bannyſhed hym ſelfe for two yeares and a halfe, and for this he was hyghlye eſtemed and commended.</p>
                        <p>For it is a good ſigne that man is a good Chriſtian, whyche of his owne free will renounceth worldlye goodes. Shortlye after It happened that <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperoure wente to conquer the Realme of <hi>Perſia,</hi> wherein a battaile he was very ſore wounded, and fell downe deade in the preſente place. For to the miſhappes of fortune, the Emperour with all his eſtate &amp; pleaſours is aſmuch ſubiect: as is the pooreſt man that lyeth in the ſtreates.

deſpiſed for Chriſtes ſake: For in the end, no men can in a thouſand yeares ſo much abaſe vs: as god in one houre can exalt vs. In the ſame yere, which was from the foundation of Rome a thouſand, a hundred, and .xix. in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie called <hi>Atrobata,</hi> it rained very fine wull, ſo that all the citie became riche. In the ſame yeare, in the citie of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> it hailed ſuche great ſtones, that they killed many men, &amp; left no herdes in the fieldes aliue. At the ſame tyme there came an earthquake throughout Italy, &amp; ſo likewyſe in <hi>Scicille,</hi> that many houſen fell and ſlewe ſundry perſons, and aboue all the ſea roſe in ſuche ſorte, that it drowned many cities nighe thereunto. <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> in the .xi. booke <hi>De geſtibus Romanorum,</hi> ſaieth, that the emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> was of a ſubtile witte, of graue cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenaunce, eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in ſpeache, yet he ſpake litle, ſtoute in his affaires, and diligent in his buſines, in aduerſities pacient, and a great enemy of the vicious, temperat in eating and drinking, &amp; a frend of religious perſons: ſo that they ſaide he reſembled the emperour <hi>Aurelius.</hi> For after that the emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> died (with whom the felicitie of the Romaine empire ended) they euer vſed thenceforth in Rome to compare and liken the young and newe come princes to the auncient emperours their anteceſſours. That is to wete: if the prince wer couragious, they ſaid he was like <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> if he were vertuous, they ſaide he was an other <hi>Octauian,</hi> if he were fortunate, that he was <hi>Tiberius,</hi> if he were raſhe, they ſayde he was <hi>Caligula,</hi> if he were cruell, they compared him to <hi>Nero,</hi> if he were merciful, thei ſayde he was like to <hi>Traian</hi> or <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> if he were beawtifull, they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to <hi>Titus,</hi> if he were idle, they compared him to <hi>Domitian,</hi> if he were pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they called him <hi>Veſpaſius,</hi> if he were te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perat they likened him to <hi>Adrian</hi> if he were deuoute to their gods, then he ſemed <hi>Aurelianus,</hi> finally he that was ſage and vertuous, they compared him to the good <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> This emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> was a good Chriſtian, and in al his affaires tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the empyre very wyſe and circumſpecte, and yet he was noted for one thynge very muche, and that was, that he truſted and fauoured his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes ſo muche, and was ſo led by his friendes, that through their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (they abuſinge his loue and credite) there aroſe manye diſſentions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges the people. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayde once to the Emperoure <hi>Nero,</hi> I wyll that thou vnderſtande (Lorde) that there is no pacience can ſuffre, that twoo or three abſolutly commaunde all, not for that they are moſte vertuous: but for that they are moſte in fauour with thee. O princes and great Lordes, if you were as I am, I knowe not what you would doe: but if I were as you be, I woulde behaue my ſelfe in ſuche ſorte to them of my houſe, that they ſhould be ſeruauntes to ſerue and obeye me, and not boſte themſelues to be in ſuche fauour to commaunde me: For that prince is not ſage that to content a fewe, getteth the hatred of all. The Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> died in the fiue and fifty yeare of his byrthe and eleuen yeare of his Empyre, of ſo longe ſickeneſſe, that his vaynes were ſo dried vp, that they could not drawe one droppe of bloude out of his body. And at the daye of his funeralles, where the dead corps was greatly bewayled. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> made anex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſermon in commendation of him, for in thoſe dayes, when any prince departed that fauoured muche the Churche, all the holy Byſhoppes mete at his buriall.</p>

                           <pb facs="tcp:21411:58"/>The two brethren being Emperours, that is to wete, <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Valent,</hi> through the deſire of the father in lawe of <hi>Gracian,</hi> that was father to his wyfe, and deſirous to haue one of his doughters children, choſe <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> to bryng vp, who had a ſonne named <hi>Gracian:</hi> whiche was created em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſo young, that as yet he had no berde. And truly the Senate would not haue ſuffered it, if the father had not bene vertuous, and the childe ſage. But the Senate would haue done this, and more alſo for <hi>Valentinian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did deſerue it well of the Romaine people. For it is reaſon in diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting of the offices, that princes haue more reſpecte to the deſertes of the fathers, then to the tender age of the children. This young <hi>Gracian</hi> began to be ſo temperate, and was ſo good a Chriſtian in fauouring the churche, that it was muche quiete, and great pleaſure to the Romaine people to haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen him, and greater ioye to the father (being aliue) to haue begotten hym: ſo that he lefte for him after his death, an immortall memorie of his life. For the childe that is vertuous, is always the memory of the father after his death.</p>
                        <p>In the yeare of the foundation of Rome a thouſand a hundreth thirtie and two, ſhe ſaid <hi>Gracian</hi> the younger was created ſole heire of the whole em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pire, his vncle <hi>Valent</hi> and his father being departed the worlde. After <hi>Gracian</hi> came to the empyre, many Byſhoppes whiche were baniſhed in the t me of his vncle <hi>Valent,</hi> were reſtored to the curche againe , and baniſhed al the ſect of the <hi>Arrians</hi> out of his region. Truly he ſhewed him ſelfe to be a very reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and catholike prince. For there is no better iuſtice to confounde hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine malice, then to eſtabliſhe the good in their eſtate. In the firſt yeare of the reigne of <hi>Gracian</hi> emperour, all the Germaines and the Gothes rebelled againſt the Romaine empire, for they would not only not obey him, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they prepared an huge army to enuade his empire, Imagining that ſithe <hi>Gracian</hi> was young, he neither had the wytte nor yet the boldnes to reſiſte them. For where the prince is young, there oftimes the people ſuffred muche wrong, and the realme great miſery. Newes come to Rome, howe that the Gaules and Germaines were vp, the emperour <hi>Gracian</hi> wrote to all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike byſhoppes that they ſhould offer in their churches great ſacrifices, with prayers vnto God, and in Rome likewyſe it was ordeined that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally proceſſions ſhould be had, to the ende almighty god ſhoulde moderate his ire againſt his people. For good Chriſtians firſt pacifie god with praiers, before they reſiſte their enemies with weapons. This good prince ſhewed him ſelfe to be no leſſe warlike in his outward affaires, then a good Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his religion. For god geueth victories vnto princes, more through teares, then through weapons. Theſe thinges thus finiſhed, and his affaires vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to god recommended, the noble emperour <hi>Gracian</hi> determined to marche on, and him ſelfe in perſone to giue the battaile. And truly as at the firſt he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him ſelfe to be a good chriſtian: ſo nowe he declared him ſelfe to be a valiaunt emperour. For it were a great infamie and diſhonour, that a prince by negligence or cowardnes ſhoulde loſe that, whiche his predeceſſours by force of armes had gotten. The army of the enemies exceaded far y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romain army in nombre, and when they met togethers in a place called <hi>Argentaria,</hi> the Romaines being inferiour to their enemies in numbre, were afraide. For in the warres the great multitude of ennemies and their puiſſaunte power,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21411:58"/>
maketh oft times the deſired victorie to be doubtfull. This thing ſeene of the Romaines, and by them conſidered, importunatly they beſought the Em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perour not to charge the battayle, for they ſaide he had not men ſufficiente. And herein they had reaſon. For the ſage prince ſhould not raſhely hazarde his perſon in the warre, nor yet ſhould lightely put his life in the handes of fortune.

                     <p>VAliaunt knightes, and companions in warre, moſte thankefully I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your ſeruice, in that you haue ſolde your goodes, and doe offer your liues here to accompanie me in the warres, and herein you ſhewe your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: for of right you ought to loſe your goodes, and to venture your liues, for the defence &amp; ſuertie of your countrie. But if I geue you ſome thankes for your company, knowe you that I geue much more for your good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell which preſently you geue me: for in great conflictes ſeldome is founde together, both good counſell and ſtoute hartes. If I haue enterpriſed this battaile in hope of mans power, then you had had reaſon that we ſhoulde not geue the battaile, ſeing the great multitude that they haue, and the ſmal numbre that we are, for as you ſay, the weightie affaires of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> publike weale ſhould not vnaduiſedly be committed, to the incertaintie of fortune. I haue taken vpon me this daungerous and perillous warres, firſte truſting that on my part iuſtice remaineth, and ſith god is the ſame onely iuſtice, I truſte aſſuredly he will geue me the victorie in this perillous conflict: For iuſtice auaileth princes more that they haue, then the men of warre do whiche they leade. Wherfore ſith my cauſe is iuſte, and that I haue god the onely iudge thereof on my ſide, me thinketh if for any worldly feare I ſhoulde ceaſe to geue the battayle, I ſhould both ſhew my ſelfe to be a prince of ſmall fayth, and alſo blaſpheme god, ſaying he were of ſmall iuſtice. For god ſheweth moſte his power there, where the fraylenes of man hath leſte hope. Then ſithe I beginne the warre, and that by me the warre is procured, and for me you are come to the warre, I haue determined to enter into the battaile, and if I periſhe therein, I ſhalbe ſure it ſhalbe for the memory of my perſonne, and the ſaluation of my ſoule. For to die through iuſtice is not to die, but to chaunge death for life. And thus doing if I loſe my life, yet therefore I loſe not my honour, and all this conſidered I doe that whiche for the common wealth I am bounde. For to a prince it were great infamy and diſhonour, that the quarell being his owne, ſhould by the bloud of others be reuenged. I wyll proue this day in battaile whether I was choſen Emperour by the deuine wyll or not. For if god this day cauſeth my life to be taken from me, it is a manifeſt token he hath a better in ſtore for me: and if through his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy I be preſerued, it ſignifieth that for ſome other better thing he graunteth me life. For in the ende the ſword of the enemie is but the ſcourge of our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. The beſt that I ſee therfore in this matter to be done is, that til three daies be paſſed the battayle be not geuen, and that we confeſſe our ſelues this night, and in the morning prepare our ſelues to receiue our redemer, &amp; beſides this that euery man pardon his chriſtian brother, if he haue had any
<pb facs="tcp:21411:59"/>
wrong or iniury done him. For oftimes though the demaunde of the warre be iuſt, yet many miſhaps befall therin, through the offences of thoſe which purſue and followe the ſame. After the thre daies are paſt, and eche thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my ſaiynges before accompliſhed in euery point as behoueth, then let god diſpoſe thinges as he ſhall ſee good, for nowe I am fully determined to aduenture my life in battaile. Wherfore my valiaunt and ſtout warriers, doubt not at all, for this day I muſt either vanquiſhe mine enemies, or els ſuffer death: and if I die, I doe that whiche nedes I muſt. Wherfore I will now ceaſe to exhorte you any more, deſiring you to conſider that, wherunto your dutie leadeth you, remembring that you are come as knightes, and in the defence of your countrey you wage battayle: for nowe we are come to that pinche, that dedes muſt more auayle vs then wordes. For peace ought to be mainteyned by the tongue, but warres ought to be atchieued by the ſworde. All theſe wordes then ended, and the three dayes paſt, the emperour <hi>Gracian</hi> in parſone gaue the battayle, where the conflicte and ſlaughter on both ſides was marueilous terrible: yet in the end the emperour <hi>Gracian</hi> had the victory ouer his enemies, and there died in that conflicte .xxx. thouſande <hi>Gothes</hi> and Almaines, and of the Romaines there were not ſlaine but fiue thouſande. For that army onely is preſerued, whiche to the deuine will is conformable. Let all other princes take example by this noble prince, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſider howe muche it auayleth them to be good Chriſtians, and that in great warres &amp; conflictes they nede not feare the great nombre of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but they ought greatly to ſe that the wrath of god be pacified. For the harte is more diſmayde with the ſecrete ſinnes, then it is feared with the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enemies.</p>

Who was named <hi>Thyrmus,</hi> a man hardy in trauailes, &amp; in daungers ſtout: For the aduenturous hartes oftimes doe commit many tyrannyes. This tyran <hi>Thyrmus</hi> by much crueltie came poſſeſſed of the realme of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> &amp; not contented therwith but alſo by tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny poſſeſſed a great part of <hi>Affrike,</hi> &amp; prepared (as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nibal</hi> did) an huge army to paſſe into Italy, to die in chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging the empire of Rome. This was a renowmed tyraunt that neuer toke pleaſure in any other thing ſo muche, as to ſpoyle &amp; robbe others of their goodes. The Romaines that in all their doinges were very ſage, &amp; of the tyranny of tyrauntes ſufficiently moniſhed, immediatly prepared a great army to paſſe into <hi>Affryke,</hi> &amp; to ſpoyle y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme, and to deſtroy the tyrante by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement and decre of the Senate, and that for no pacte or couenaunt the tyraunt ſhoulde lyue. And without doubte this commaundement was iuſt. For to him that is a deſtroyer of the common wealth, it is not puniſhement enough to take awaye his lyfe. At that tyme there was a knyghte in Rome, whoſe name was <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> a man well ſtryken in yeares, and yet better approued in warres, but he was not the richeſt: howbeit he vau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him ſelf (as truth was) to be of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21411:59"/>
                        <hi>Traian</hi> the great Emperour, vpon which occaſion he was greatly honoured and feared in Rome, for the commons were ſo noble and gracious towards their princes, that all thoſe whiche from the good and vertuous Emperour deſcended, were of the whole common wealth greatly eſtemed. This noble <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was of yeares ſo auncient, and ſo honoured in his olde age for his graye heares, ſo noble of linage, and ſo approued in warres, that he was by the authoritie of the Emperour <hi>Valentinian,</hi> by the conſent of all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and by the good wylles of the whole people, choſen to goe to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Afrike,</hi> and truly their reaſon was good. For <hi>Theodoſius</hi> deſired much to fight againſt that tyraunt <hi>Thirmus,</hi> and all the people were glad that ſuch a captaine led the armie. So this <hi>Theodoſius</hi> imbarked with his armie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Rome, and in fewe dayes arryued at <hi>Bona,</hi> whiche was a citie greatly repleniſhed with people, ſituated in a hauen of the ſea in <hi>Afrike.</hi> And as he and his armie were landed, the tyran <hi>Thirmus</hi> forthwith encamped his armie in the fielde in the face of the Romaines, and ſo all beinge planted in the plaine, the one to aſſaulte, and the others to defend: immediatly the two armies ioyned, and the one aſſaulting the other fiercely, on bothe ſydes was great ſlaughter. So that thoſe whiche to daye were conquered, to morowe did conquere: and thoſe whiche yeſterday were conquerours, afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained conquered. For in long warres, fortune chaungeth. In the prouince of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> there was a ſtrong citie called <hi>Obeliſta,</hi> and as the captaine <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doſius</hi> by his force occupied all the field, the tyran <hi>Thirmus</hi> fortified him ſelfe in that citie, the which valiauntly being aſſaulted of the captaine <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> &amp; almoſt with his men entring into the ſame, the tyranne <hi>Thirmus</hi> (becauſe he would not commit hym ſelfe vnto the faith of other men) ſlew him ſelf with his proper handes. For the propertie of proude and diſdainfull hertes is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to die in libertie, then to liue in captiuitie. At that tyme the Emperour <hi>Valent,</hi> by the arte of Nigromancie, wrought ſecretly to knowe what lucke ſhould ſuccede in the Romaine Empire. And by chaunce a woman being an enchauntreſſe had aunſwere of the deuill, that the name whiche with theſe letters ſhould be wrytten, ſhould be ſucceſſour to the Empire, and the letters were theſe. <hi>T.E.O.D.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Valent</hi> diligently enquired of all the names, which with theſe foure letters could be named, and they found that thoſe ſignified the <hi>Theodotes,</hi> the <hi>Theodores,</hi> and the <hi>Theodoſes:</hi> wherfore <hi>Valent</hi> furthwith put all thoſe to the ſworde that were of that name: Suche was the wickednes of the Emperour <hi>Valent,</hi> ſuppoſing thei would haue taken the Empire from him being alyue. For the tyranous Prince lyueth euer in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and ſuſpition. The excellent captaine <hi>Theodoſius</hi> (the tyranne <hi>Thirmus</hi> being dead, and hauing ſubdued all <hi>Affrike</hi> to the Romaine Empire) was burdened that he was a ſecret traytour to the Empyre, and that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed to wynne the ſame by tyrannie, for this cauſe therefore the Emperour <hi>Valent</hi> gaue ſentence he ſhoulde be beheaded. And this was done he neuer hearyng of it, and muche leſſe culpable thereof: for all Prynces that be wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in their doynges, are very abſolute of their ſentence. This come to the eares of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and ſeyng that he was condemned to be beheaded, he ſent incontinent for the Byſhoppe of <hi>Carthage,</hi> to whome he demaunded the water of the holy Baptiſme, and ſo being baptiſed, and in the fayth of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:21411:60"/>
inſtructed, was by the hangeman put to execution. Of this ſo greuous, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tragious, and deteſtable facte euery man iudged this <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to ſuffer as an innocent, and that the Emperour <hi>Valent</hi> had iudged euill and like a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt. For the innocencie of the good, is the great enemy of the euill. At the ſame time when <hi>Theodoſius</hi> demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded baptiſme (according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaying of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſper</hi> in his cronicle) he ſayd vnto the biſhop, whiche ſhould baptiſe him, theſe wordes. O byſhop ſainct Roger, I doe coniure thee by the creatour whiche made vs, and doe deſire thee for the paſſion of Ieſu Chriſte who redemed vs, to geue me the water of baptiſme: for I haue made a vowe to become a Chriſtian, if god graunted me victory. Wherefore I wyll accompliſhe my vowe, for thoſe thinges whiche neceſſitie cauſeth vs to promyſe, our owne free wyll ought to accompliſhe. I am ſory with all my heart that beynge a Chriſtian I can liue no longer, and ſith it is ſo I offer my life for his ſake, and into his mercifull handes I commende my ſoule. I leue a ſonne of myne, who is called <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and if the fatherly loue begile me not, I thinke he wyll be a vertuous and ſtoute young man, and beſides that he wil be wiſe, and ſithe by thy handes he hath bene baptiſed, I require thee holy father that thou through thy wyſedome wilt bring him vp in the true faith: for if he be a good Chriſtian, I truſt in god he will be a great man in the Empire. This <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was the father of the great Emperour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> ſo that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was a Chriſtian, and the ſonne a Chriſtian. Not longe after the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Valent</hi> had cauſed <hi>Theodoſius</hi> (which was father to the great Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi>) to be executed, <hi>Valent</hi> by the commaundement of God was by the <hi>Gothes</hi> perſecuted, and in thend put to death, and truly this was the iuſt iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of god. For he of right ſhould ſuffer death him ſelfe, whiche vniuſtly procureth the death of others. <hi>Rufinus</hi> in the ſeconde booke of his hiſtories ſaith, that after the tyraunt <hi>Thirmus</hi> was put to death by the captaine <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius,</hi> and that the Emperour <hi>Valent</hi> had cauſed this <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to be put to death, and that the ſame <hi>Valent</hi> was ſlaine of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> the Romains crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a king in <hi>Afrike,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Hiſmarus,</hi> called for a right Chriſtian in that time, which was from the buylding of Rome .377. There was in the citie of <hi>Carthage</hi> a holy byſhop called <hi>Siluanus,</hi> a man in humaine and deuine letters excellently well learned, and ſithe the kyng was ſo iuſte, and the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſo holy, both the faith encreaſed, and alſo the affayres of the common weale proſpered. For commonly the warres beginne rather through the pride of the higheſt, then through diſobedience in the loweſt. Therefore this holy byſhop and good Chriſtian king, being deſirous in their tyme to geue good example to the ſubiectes, and for the time to come to leaue good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes, they celebrated in the citie of <hi>Bona</hi> a counſaile, with all the byſhoppes of <hi>Affryke,</hi> in the whiche kyng <hi>Hiſmarus</hi> was in perſone. For in auncient cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles the kynges were not onely there in perſones, but alſo al the lordes and hie eſtates of their Realmes. Amongeſt many excellent thinges, which <hi>Rufi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> mentioneth that were ordayned in this place, it ſemed good vnto me to remember here theſe few, to the ende chriſtian princes nowe preſent, may ſee what deuout chriſtians thoſe kinges were in times paſte.</p>

Becauſe in ſuche ſemblable affayres, it is both mete and requiſite, that the royall preheminens be reuerenced: and the auctoritie of the Churche not diminiſhed. We ordeine that from two yeares to two yeares all the Byſhoppes, Abbottes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of our Realme doe aſſemble and celebrate a prouintial counſaile, and that in this counſayle there be no temporall matters ſpoken of, but of the diſorders and miſgouernaunce of Churches, for the Churche is not loſt for the lacke of ſcarſitie of money: but for the to great aboundance of riches.</p>
                        <p>We ordeine, and all prelates which are now and ſhalbe here after we deſire that when they will cal any counſaile in our Realmes, that before the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracion of the ſame they certifye vs leſte that vnder the couler or cloke of a holy counſaile, there ſhoulde ſome ſuſpicious aſſembly be had.</p>
                        <p>We ordaine that from henceforth the Princes and great Lordes be bounde to repaire to the ſacred counſaile, wyth all the company of the holy Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes. For it were more mete they ſhould come to deſtroye falſe heretikes, in winning their ſoules: then to fyght agaynſt their enemyes, in loſinge their lyues. We ordeine that the Prince whyche commeth not to the counſailes through negligence, that vnto hym the Sacrament of the body of Chriſte be not miniſtred, vntyll the next counſell be celebrated. And if perchaunce he refuſe not to come throughe negligence, but throughe malyce, we will that thenne they proceade againſt him as a ſuſpect parſon in the faith of Chriſte. For the Chriſtian Prince that of malyce onely committeth an offence is not parfitte in the holy catholyke fayth. We ordaine that at the firſte aſſemblie of the counſaile, all the prelates togethers openlye, and afterwardes eche one by hym ſelfe priuatelye ſhall ſaye the crede ſingynge, the whyche thinge finiſhed, the Kynge hym ſelfe alone ſhall ſaye the crede lykewiſe. For if the prince be ſuſpected of the holy catholyke fayth, it is vnpoſſible that hys peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be good Chriſtians. We ordaine that in thys counſaile the prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes haue lybertye and aucthoritie to ſaye vnto the kyng that that is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and decente, and the kynge likewiſe to ſaye in the counſayle what hee thinke beſt, ſoo that the prelates might tell the king without feare of hys lytell care, he hath in deſtroyenge the heretikes and hereſies of his realme: and likewiſe the king might tell the prelates their neglygence that they vſe in the charge of their flocke. For the end and intencion of counſayles oughte not to be any otherwiſe then a ſcourge for offences paſte, and a reformaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the euils to come. We ordaine that all the princes of <hi>Affricke,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly before they do any other thinge in the morning, do openly and dilygent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to morning prayer: and we wil alſo that ther be preſent al his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and priuate counſellours, which with them ought to enter into coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile. For that creature can not giue any good counſaile, who hath not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiled himſelfe vnto god before. We ordaine, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Archbiſhoppes, Biſhoppes, and Abbottes, continually duringe the time of the counſaile, do euery daye confeſſe them ſelues, to almighty god, ſeruing him deuoutly, and that one of them do preach to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people gods word. For if euery prelate be bound to giue good example alone, then being altogether they ſhal giue it much better. We ordaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes (aſmuch as lyeth in them do giue vnto their ſubiects good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, &amp; that on the ſabbotte day in eſpecially &amp; other Feſtiuall dayes they

repaire vnto the cathedral Church to here deuine ſeruice, &amp; ther reconcileng them ſelues to god, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they publickly in the preſence of the congregacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy comunion &amp; ſupper of the Lord. For it would be a great ſclaunder to Princes, which ought to reprehend others of their faults, that a man ſhould neuer ſee them come to the Church, and be partakers of that holye Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We ordaine, that at Eaſter chiefly Princes do go to the church Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall and that the <hi>Metropolitan</hi> be there in perſon to celebrate the holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: and the goſpel being ſayd, the Prince hymſelfe ſhalbe bound to ſay with a loude voice, the crede confirmed in the ſacred counſaile of <hi>Nicene.</hi> For the good Princes ought not only in their hartes to be faithful vnto Ieſus Chriſt, but are alſo bound openly with theyr mouthes to confeſſe it before the people. We ordeine, that Princes be not ſo hardie to haue in their courte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue two biſhoppes, the one to giue him ghoſtlye counſell, and the other to preache vnto him the word of God. And thoſe we will that the counſell aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne vnto him, and that they be bound to find two perſonnes of the moſt auncient and vertuous, which ſhall remaine in the courte no more but two yeares, and that afterwardes others be placed there in their ſteades. For there is nothinge more monſtrous, then to ſee the Churche longe withoute prelates.</p>

In mans iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it ſemeth that it were better all were alike in apparel, al equal in commaunding, none greater then others in poſſeſſions, al to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them ſelues with one kynde of meate, and that the names of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding and obeing were vtterly abolyſſhed and brought to nought. So that if the myſeries of the one, and proſperities of the other were put out, from that day forward I proteſt there ſhould be no enuy in the world. Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng aſyde mans opinion, (whiche oughte not to be compared to the deuine miſterie) I demaund now what reaſon ſufficed to thincke, that of two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (that is to wete <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> both children of holy and deuout per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnes) the deuine prouydence woulde the one ſhoulde bee choſen, and the other diſpiſed, that the one ſhoulde commaunde, and the other obeye, the one to be diſherited beinge the eldeſte, and the other to inherite beinge the yongeſte?

This thinge was repined at of all the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21411:61"/>
eleuen bretherne, how be it their intencions auayled not: for it is vnpoſſible for mans malice to diſorder that, which the deuine prouidence hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: we ſe daylye nothing els but that which man decreeth in a longe time, god diſpoſeth otherwiſe in one moment. Truly it is not euill done, but wel ordeined. For in the ende, ſithe man is man, in fewe thinges he can be eyther certaine or aſſured: and ſith God is God, it is vnpoſſible that in any thinge he ſhould erre. It is a great benefite of the creator, to be willing to reforme and correct the workes of the creatures. For if God woulde ſuffer vs to do after our owne mindes, we ſhould be quyte contrarie to his pleaſure. God without a great myſterye did not ordeine, that in one family there ſhoulde be but one father, amonge one people there ſhoulde be but one citizen that ſhould commaunde, in one prouynce ther ſhould be but one gouernor alone, and alſo that one king alone ſhould gouerne a proude Realme, and likewiſe that by one onlye captaine a puiſſant armye ſhould be led. And furthermore and aboue all, he willeth that there be but one Monarchyall king and Lord of the world. Truly all theſe thinges are ſuch, that we with our eyes do ſee them and know them not, we heare them with our eares and vnderſtand them not, we ſpeake them with our tongues and know not what we ſay. For truly mans vnderſtanding is ſo dull, that wythout doubt he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt of more then he knoweth. <hi>Appolonius Thianeus</hi> compaſſing the moſte part of <hi>Aſia, Affricke,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> that is to ſay from the bridge of <hi>Nilus</hi> wher <hi>Alexander</hi> was, vnto <hi>Gades</hi> where the pillers of <hi>Hercules</hi> were, he beinge one day in <hi>Epheſe,</hi> in the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> the prieſtes aſked him what thing he wondered at moſt in all the world? for it is a generall rule, that men which haue ſene much, alwayes do note one thing aboue another. Althoughe the Philoſopher <hi>Appolonius</hi> greatlyer eſtemed the workes, then the ſpeakinge of them that demaunded this queſtion, yet forthwith he made them this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, I let you know prieſtes of <hi>Diana,</hi> that I haue bene throughout <hi>Fraunce England, Spayne, Germany,</hi> throughe the <hi>Laces,</hi> and <hi>Lidians, Hebrues,</hi> and <hi>Greekes, Parthes,</hi> and <hi>Medes, Phrigians,</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and ſo with the <hi>Perſes,</hi> and aboue all in the great Realme of <hi>India:</hi> for that alone is more worthe, then all theſe Realmes together. I wyl you vnderſtand that all theſe Realmes in manye and ſondrye thinges do dyffer, as in languages, perſonnes, beaſtes, mettals, waters, fleſhe, cuſtomes, lawes, landes, buyldinges, in apparel, and fortes, and aboue all dyuers in their Gods and Temples. For the language of the one dyffereth not ſo muche from the language of the other: as the Gods of <hi>Europe</hi> differ from the Gods of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Temples and gods of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> differ from them of <hi>Affrike.</hi> Amonges all thinges which I haue ſene, of two onlye I dyd meruaile, which is, that in all the partes of the worlde wherin I haue trauailed, I haue ſeen quyet men troubled by ſedycious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones, the humble ſubiect to the proude, the iuſt obedient to the tyraunt, I haue ſene the cruel commaunding the merciful, the coward ruling the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, the ignoraunt teaching the wiſe, &amp; aboue al, I ſaw that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt theues hunge the innocent on the gallowes. The other thing wherat I marueiled was this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places &amp; circuite wher I haue bene, I know not, neither could I find any man that was euerlaſting, but that all are mortal &amp; in the ende both high &amp; lowe haue an end: for many are layde to nighte into their

graue, which the next day following thought to be aliue. Leaue aſide the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine iudgment, in that he ſpake he ſaid highly and like a Philoſopher, for it ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth to be a pleaſaunt thing, to ſee how men gouerne the world. Therfore now to the matter, it is but reaſon we know the cauſe of this ſo auncient a noueltye, whiche is: that God wylleth and ordeinethe that one onlye commaunde all, and that all together obey one. For there is nothing that God doth (thoughe the cauſe therof be vnknowen to vs) that wanteth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his eternall wiſedome. In this caſe ſpeakyng like a Chriſtian I ſaye, that if our father Adam had obeyed one onlye commaundemente of God, whiche was forbydden him in the terreſtial Paradiſe, we had remayned in lybertie vpon the earth, and ſhould haue bene Lordes and maiſters ouer al. But ſith he would not then obey the Lord, we are nowe become the ſlaues of ſo many Lords. O wicked ſine, curſed be thou, ſith by the onely the world is broughte into ſuche a bondage: without teares I cannot ſpeake that which I would, that through our firſt fathers, (which ſubmitted them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to ſinne) we their children haue loſt the ſygnorye of the world. For ſithe they were priſoners to ſynne in their hartes: lytle auaileth the lybertie of their bodyes. There was great dyuerſitie betwixt the opynions of <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> and the opinyons of <hi>Socrates,</hi> for ſomuch as thoſe of <hi>Socrates</hi> ſcoole ſaide, that it were better all thinges ſhould be common, and all men equall. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſcoole ſayde the contrarie, and that the common wealthe were better wherin eche one had his owne proper, and all, ſhould obey one, ſo that the one of them dyd admit and graunte the name of ſeruantes, and thothers dyd deſpiſe the name of Lordes. As <hi>Laertius</hi> in his firſt booke of the life of Philoſophers ſayth, that the Philoſopher <hi>Demoſtenes</hi> was alſo of the ſame opinyon, that to the end the people ſhould be well gouerned, he would two names ſhould be vtterly abboliſhed, and taken a way: that is to wete, Lords and ſubiectes, maſters and ſeruaunts: for the one deſirous to rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by fyerſnes, and thothers not willyng to obeye by tyranny, would ſhedde the bloud of the innocent, and would be vyolent agaynſt the poore: they would deſtroy the renowmed &amp; famous people, and tyrannes would waxe ſtout, the which thyngs ſhould be taken away, if there were no ſygnorye, nor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uytude in the world. But notwithſtanding theſe thinges, the Phyloſopher in his firſt booke of his pollitiques ſayth, that by fower natural reaſons we may proue it to be very neceſſarie, that Princes do commaund, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple obey. The firſt reaſon is of the partes of the Elements, ſymple, and mixt. For we ſe by experience, that the Elementes do ſuffer (to thende they wold be ioyned together) the one to haue more power then al: the whyche is ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed by experyence, foraſmuch as the Element of the fyer, the Element of the ayer, and the Element of the water do obey, the Element of the earth doth commaund. For againſt their nature he bryngeth them all to the earth. But if all the noble and chiefeſt Elements were obedyente to the moſt vile Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, onely to forme a body myxt: it is a greater reaſon, that al obeye to one vertuous perſon, that the common wealth mighte therby the better be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned. The ſecond reaſon is, of the bodye &amp; the ſoule, in the armony wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſoule is the miſtreſſe which commaundeth, and the body the ſeruaunt which obeyeth, fo the body neither ſeeth, heareth, nor vnderſtandeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21411:62"/>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body. The ſage Philoſopher by this wil infer, that the ſage men ſhould naturally be lords ouer others. For in the world ther is nothing more m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, then that fooles ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund, &amp; wiſe men obey. The third reaſon taketh his ground on beaſtes: for we ſe by experience that diuers beaſtes by thonely knowledge of men are gouerned, therfore it is but mete that many men, which are more lyker beaſtes then the beaſtes theym ſelues, do ſuffer them ſelues to be gouerned and ruled by wiſe men. For the common weale is more profited by a brute beaſt, then it is by a witleſſe man. The fourth rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon proceadeth of women: for we ſe, that they being created to the image of God, god commaundeth and ordayneth that they ſhould be ſubiect to man, preſuppoſing their knowledge not to be ſo great, as the knowledge of men. Therfore if this thing be thus, why could not diuerſe mortal men (who with out compariſon know leſſe then women) take theym ſelues for happie that one alone would commaund &amp; gouerne them: ſo that ſuch one were a ſage &amp; vertuous parſon. Sithe man is naturally pollytike, which is to be a frend of company, the company engendreth enuy, &amp; afterwards diſcord noriſheth warre, &amp; warre bringeth in tiranny, &amp; tiranny deſtroyeth the comon wealth, &amp; the common wealth being loſt, all men thinke their liues in peryl. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very neceſſarie that in the common wealth many be gouerned by one alone, for to conclude, ther is no common wealth wel gouerned but by one alone. The great trauayles and inconuenyences which the auncientes found in tymes paſt, were the occaſion that it was ordeyned in the publyke weale, that all ſhould obey one. Sythe that in a campe one onely Captaine is obeyed, and in the ſea one Pilot followed, in the monaſterye all obeye one prelate, and in the Churche all obeye one byſhoppe, and ſyns in a hyue of bees, one bee onely leadeth all the reſt: it were not reaſon that men ſhould be without one king, nor the common wealth without a gouernour, Thoſe men that will not haue a king in a common wealth, are lyke vnto drones &amp; waſpes which without trauaile eate the ſwete of others. And mine opinion in this caſe ſhould be, that euery man that will not be commaunded, as an abiect of the common weale ſhould be expulſed and caſt out therof. For in a common wealthe ther can be no greater enemye then he, that deſireth that many ſhould rule therin. In that publike weale where one alone hath care for al, &amp; al obey the commaundement of one onely, there God ſhalbe ſerued, the people ſhal profit, the good ſhalbe eſtemed, &amp; the euil diſpiſed, and beſides that tirannes ſhalbe ſuppreſſed. For a gouernaunce of many is not profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, onleſſe they referre theym ſelues to the iudgemente of a fewe, and to the arbitermente of one alone. Oh howe man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e people and Realmes (becauſe they woulde not obey their princes by iuſtice) haue ſince by cruell tirannes bene gouerned with tyrannye. For it is euen a iuſte plage, that they which diſire the ſcepters of righteous Princes, ſhoulde feale and proue the ſcourge of cruell tirauntes. Alwayes it was, and ſhalbe, that in the worlde there was one to commaunde, another to obeye, one to gouerne, and another to bee gouerned. In this caſe lette no manne ſaye, I am excepted, for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll thys daye there hath noo Prynce nor Knyghte beene ſeene, but hathe trauayled vnder thys yooke, I warne and praye, and importunatelye requyre you all, that you be loyall, and faythefull ſeruauntes, to the ende
<pb facs="tcp:21411:63"/>
you may deſerue to haue louing Lords. For generally the prince y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is wicked, cauſeth his ſubiects to rebel, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſedicious ſubiect maketh his lord to become a tiraunt. It is a great thing to the people, that their Princes be good or euil, For there are no Princes ſo ſtable, nor ſo temperate, that alwayes will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the euil: nor there is no gouernor ſo very a tyraunte, but ſometimes wil acknowledge the good. Oftimes god ſuffereth, that ther be Emperours in the Empire, kinges in realmes, and gouernors in the prouinces, Lordes in the cities, and prelates in the churches, not al only as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> common wealth deſireth, nor as the good gouernmente requyreth: but as the offence of the multitude deſerueth. For now a dayes we ſe many y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> haue the charge of ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, which deſerue not kepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſheape in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field. That to be true, plainly it doth appeare. For ſuch do not gouerne but diſorder, they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend but offend: they do not reſiſt the enemyes, but ingage &amp; ſel the innocent: they are no iudges, but tirannes: they are not gentil paſtores, but cruel hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: they are not incre aſers of the common wealthe, but diſtroyers of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: they are not ordeynors of lawes, but inuentors of trybutes: their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes wake not to good, but to inuent and worke al miſchefe: and finally God ſendeth vs ſuch prelates and gouernors, not for that they ſhoulde be myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his lawes, but for that they ſhould be ſcourges for oure offences.</p>

                     <p>IN the firſt booke of the Kinges, the viii.

For on the beaſtes &amp; fertile feldes that you haue, his herd ſhal fede, he ſhal gather the beſt grapes of your vines, he ſhall choſe of your oliue trees the beſt olyues &amp; oyles, and if anye fruit afterwards remaine in your feilds, he wil they ſhalbe gathered not by you but of his workemen, &amp; afterwards y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king that I wil geue you ſhal op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe you much more. For of euery pecke of corne you ſhal geue him one, of tenne ſhepe you muſt nedes geue him one, ſo that of al things which you ſhal gather, againſt your wylles, you ſhal giue the tenth: of your ſlaues the king ſhalbe ſerued ſoner then you, and he ſhal take al your Oxen that labour and trauaile in your owne poſſeſſions, &amp; ſhal bring them to ploughe in his owne ground, and tenements. So that you ſhal pay tribute, and the king ſhal take his owne profite, for the wealth and commoditie of his pallace. And al thys which I haue reherſed before, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King ſhal haue whom I wil geue you. The hiſtorye which here I haue declared, is not <hi>Ouide,</hi> neither yet the <hi>Eglogges</hi> of <hi>Virgil,</hi> ne yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayninge of <hi>Homer,</hi> but it is the ſentence &amp; the very worde of god. O mortal ignoraunce, that we demaund and know not why nor wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to whom nor wher, neyther when we demaund? which cauſeth vs to fall into ſondry errors. For few men are ſo wiſe that they offend not in cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, &amp; that they can aſke with reaſon. The Hebrues aſked (as they thinke) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better, and god geueth them the worſe: they aſke one to gouerne them, and god gyueth them a Tiraunt to deſtroy them: they aſke one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne them in iuſtice, and he threatneth them with tiranny: they require one that ſhould geue them, &amp; he geueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one which robbeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they require one to deliuer them from bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage, &amp; he ordaineth one to kepe them as ſlaues. And finally the Hebrues truſting to be deliuered of their iudges, which ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not according to theyr appetites, god ſhal geue them a king y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhal take they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> goodes from them by force. O how many times ought we to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to god to giue vs princes in our comon wealth, &amp; prelates in our churches, which do know how to gouerne vs, and minyſter vnto vs, not accordynge to the weyght of our ſoule, but accordyng to the meaſure of hys mercy. <hi>Plato</hi> ſath in the firſt booke of lawes, that one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt excellent lawes which
<pb facs="tcp:21411:64"/>
the <hi>Siciones</hi> had in their prouince, was to kepe the Cities, that they ſhoulde not chaunge nor alter any thing therin. Truly thoſe Barbarous were ſage in doing, and <hi>Plato</hi> was very diſcrete to commend them therin. For nothing deſtroyeth a common wealth ſoner, then to ſuffer chaunges oftetimes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Al theſe things ſemed to be true in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hebrues, the which in their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were very raſhe, and vndiſcrete. For firſt they gouerned theym ſelues by Patriarches, as Abraham was.

This puniſhment fell (accordyng to the iuſt iudgement of God) vppon theym for their offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces: for it was euen mete, that they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> would not enioy the pleaſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lybertie of <hi>Iudea,</hi> ſhould taſt the cruell ſeruitude of <hi>Babylone.</hi> The condicion whych chaunced in the gouernement to the vnconſtant Hebrues: the ſame happened vnto the proude Romaines. The which in the beginning of theyr Empire were gouerned by kinges, afterwardes by tenne men, then by the Conſulles, ſoo by the dictators, by the Cenſours, and afterwardes by the Tribu nes, and Senatours: and in the ende, they came to be gouerned by Emperours, and tirannous princes. The Romaynes inuented all theſe alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racions in their gouernments, for none other cauſe, but to ſee whether they could be deliuered from the commaundement of an other. For the Romay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in this caſe were ſo proude harted, that they had rather dye in lybertie, then liue in captiuitie God had ſo ordeyned it, and their wofull caſe dyd ſoo promyſe it, when they were aboue al other kyngs and realmes of the earth, that then the ſlaue ſhould be obedyent to his yronnes, and the ſubiect ſhould acknowledge the homage to hys maiſter. And though the ſubiects do moue warres, though kinges alſo do wynne Realmes, and Emperours conquere Empyres: yet wyl they or nyl they (both great &amp; ſmall ſhould acknowledge them ſelues for ſeruauntes.</p>
                     <p>For duringe the tyme of oure fleſhlye lyfe, wee canne neuer withdrawe oure ſelues frome the yooke of ſeruitude. And ſaye not you Princes, for that you are puyſſaunte princes, that you are excepted from ſeruitude of menne. For withoute doubte it is a thinge more vntollerable, to haue their hartes burdened with thoughtes, then their neckes loden with yrons. If a ſlaue be good, they take from him ſome yrons: but to you that are pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the greater you are, they greater cares you haue. For the prynce that for hys common wealthe taketh care, hath not one momente of an houre quyete. A ſlaue hopeth to be delyuered in hys lyfe, but you can not looke to be delyuered tyl after youre death.</p>
                     <p>They laye yrons on the ſlaue by weyghte, but thoughtes burdenne you wythoute meaſure. For the wofull heart is more burdened with one houre of care: thenne the bodye is preſſed, wyth twentye pounde of yrone. A ſlaue or pryſonner if he bee alone, manye tymes fylethe of hys yrons, but you Princes that are alone, are more greuouſlye tormented wythe thoughtes: for ſoletarye places are Arbours, and Gardeyns to woofull and heauye hartes.</p>

                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:21411:64"/>A ſlaue hath nothing to care for but himſelfe alone: but you that be Princes haue to ſatiſfie &amp; pleaſe al men. For the prince ſhuld haue a time for himſelf, &amp; alſo for thoſe which are aboue him. The deuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſaide wel, that he that ſhold haue the leſt part of a prince, &amp; belonging to a prince, oughte to be the prince himſelfe. For to the end the prince ſhould be al his owne, he ought to haue no part in himſelfe. Though a ſlaue worke &amp; trauaile in the day, yet he ſlepeth without care in the night: but you princes paſſe the daies in hearing importunate ſuetes, &amp; the night in fetching innumerable ſighes. Finallye I ſay, that in a ſlaue (be it wel, or be it euil) al his paine is finiſhed in one yere, or is ended at his death: but what ſhal a woful prince do when he dyeth. If he were good, ther is but a ſhort memorie of his goodnes: and if he hath bene euil, his infamy ſhal neuer haue end.

And from <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> hitherto haue bene called Emperours. The firſt battaile y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was giuen in the world (as we rede) was in the wild valleis, which now they cal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead &amp; ſalt ſea. For a great part of that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then was the maine land, is now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead ſea. The holy ſcriptures cannot deceue vs, for it is ful of al truth, &amp; by them it is declared, that a thouſand &amp; eyght hundred yeres after the world began, there was no battaile aſſembled, nor company that met to fight in the field: for at that tyme whan they had no ambition nor couetouſnes, they knewe not what battaile mente.

The maner was thus, that <hi>Baſſa</hi> being king of <hi>Sodome, Berſa</hi> kyng of <hi>Gomorrhe, Senaab</hi> kyng of <hi>Adamee, Semebar</hi> king of <hi>Seboime,</hi> and <hi>Vale</hi> king of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,</hi> were al fyue tributaries to <hi>Chodor laomor</hi> kynge of the <hi>Aelamites,</hi> which fyue kynges conſpired agaynſt hym becauſe they woulde paye hym no tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,

For the olde malice of the warre is, that where they cannot haue their enemyes whiche are in the faulte: they put to ſacke and diſtroy thoſe which are innocent and giltleſſe. So the one aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and the other defending, in the end all come to the field, they gaue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle as two enemyes, and the greateſt part was ouercome of the feweſt, and the feweſt remained victorious ouer the greateſt, which thing GOD would ſuffer in the firſt battaile of the world, to the end princes might take example, that all the miſhappes of the warres come not, but becauſe they are begon of an vniuſt occaſion. If <hi>Chodor Laomor</hi> had held himſelfe conten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted as hys predeceſſours dyd, and that he had not conquered Realmes in makinge theym ſubiect, and had not cauſed theym to paye trybute: neither they vnto him, woulde haue denied reaſon: nor he with theym woulde haue waged battaile. For throughe the couetouſnes of the one, and the ambition of the other, enmyties grewe betwene the people, This conſidered whiche we haue ſpoken of ſygnorye, and of thoſe which came into contentions for ſignoryes, Let vs now ſe from whence the firſt oryginal of ſeruitude came, and the names of ſeruauntes and lordes whiche were in the olde tyme, and whether ſeruitude was by the diſcord of vertuous men, firſte brought into the world: or els inuented by the ambytion of Tyrauntes. For when the one commaundeth, and the other obeyeth, it is one of the nouelties of the world as the holy ſcripture declareth vnto vs in this maner. The patriarche <hi>Noah</hi> had 3. ſonnes, which wer <hi>Shem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> and the ſecond ſonne (which was <hi>Ham</hi>) begotte <hi>Cuſh,</hi> and this <hi>Cuſh</hi> begot <hi>Nimrod. Nimrod</hi> made him ſelfe a honter of wild beaſtes, in the woodes and mountaines, he was the firſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> began to play the tyraunt amongeſte men, inforcynge theyr perſonnes, and taking theyr goodes, and the ſcriptures called him <hi>Oppreſſor hominum,</hi> which is to ſay, an oppreſſor of men. For men of euyl life, alwayes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit much euill in a common wealth. He taught the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> to honour the fyre, he was the firſt that preſumed to be an abſolute lorde, and the firſte that euer requyred of men homage and ſeruice. This curſed tyraunte ended his lyfe in the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den world, wherin al thinges were in common, with the common wealth. For the auncientes vſed their goodes in common: but their willes onelye they reſerued to them ſelues. They ought not to thinke it a lighte matter, for his perſon to haue bene a Tiraunt: but they ought to thinke it a greater ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to haue bene a rebell in a common wealthe. And muche more they oughte to take and eſteame it as an euill matter in hym, whyche hathe bene (as he was) a diſturber of the good cuſtomes of hys countrye: but the moſte vniuſte of all is, to leaue behynd hym anye euyll cuſtome brought into the common wealthe. For if hee deſerue greate infamye whyche woorketh euyll in hys lyfe: trulye hee deſerueth muche moore, whych tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayleth to bryng that euyl in vre after hys death. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſemeth to affirme,

that after this <hi>Nimrod</hi> had deſtroyed the realme of <hi>Chaldea</hi> by his plagues, he came to dwel in Italy with viii. ſonnes, &amp; built the citie of <hi>Cameſa,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, in <hi>Saturnes</hi> time was called <hi>Valentia,</hi> &amp; in the time of <hi>Romulus</hi> it was called as it is at this preſent, Rome.

For euen as Hieruſalem was the doughter of the pacient, &amp; the manſion of the quyet kinges in <hi>Aſia:</hi> ſo was Rome the mother of proude princes in <hi>Europe.</hi> The hiſtories of the gentiles (which knew not the holy ſcripture) declare in an other ſort the beginninge of Signorye and ſeruitude, &amp; when they came into the worlde: for the Idolatrers not onlye did not know the creatoure of the world: but alſo they were ignoraunte of many things which beganne in the world. They therefore ſay, that the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranne <hi>Nimrod</hi> (amongeſt the others) had a ſonne called <hi>Belus.</hi> &amp; that this <hi>Belus</hi> was the firſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raigned in the land of <hi>Syria,</hi> &amp; that he was the firſt that inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted warres on the earth, &amp; that he ſet vp the firſt monarchie among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

The firſt monarchie of the worlde, was that of the <hi>Aſſirians,</hi> &amp; continued 132. yeres. The firſt king was <hi>Belus,</hi> &amp; the laſt king was <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> whom (at that tyme when he was ſlaine) they found ſpinninge with women hauing a diſtaffe in his hand, wherwith they vſe to ſpinne: &amp; truly this vile death was to good for ſuch a cowardly king. For the prince ought not to defend that with the diſtafe, that his predeceſſours had wonne with the ſworde. As we haue ſaid <hi>Nimrod</hi> begat <hi>Belus:</hi> who had to wife <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myramis,</hi> which was the mother of <hi>Ninus,</hi> which <hi>Ninus</hi> ſucceded his father in tyranny, &amp; in the empire alſo: and both the mother &amp; the ſonne not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to be Tyraunts, inuented ſtatues of newe gods.

O worldly malice,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:66"/>
O curſed &amp; wicked world, that thou neuer ſuffereſt things to remaine in one eſtate, and thought I cal the curſed, maruaile not therat: for when we are in moſt proſperitie, then thou with death perſecuteſt vs moſt cruelly. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out teares I ſay not that I wil ſay, that 2000 yeres of the world wer paſt before we knew what the world ment, god ſuffering it, and worldly malice inuenting it, ploughes were turned into weapons, oxen to horſes, goades to lances, whippes to arrowes, ſlinges to croſbowes, ſimplycitye into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, trauaile into Idlenes, reſt to paine, peace to warre, loue to hatred, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to crueltie, Iuſtice to tyranny, profite to domage, almes to theft, &amp; aboue al, fayth into Idolatrie. And finallye the ſwete they had to profite in their owne goods, they tourned to bloud ſheading, to the domage of the comon wealth. And herein the world ſheweth it ſelfe to be a world, herein worldly malice ſheweth it ſelfe to be malicious, in ſomuch as the one reioyceth, &amp; the other lamenteth: the one reioceth to ſtomble, to the end the other may fall &amp; breake his necke, the one reioyceth to be poore, to the end the other maye not be riche: the one reioyſeth to be diſpraiſed, to the end the other may not be honored: the one delighteth to be ſad, to the ende the other ſhoulde not be merye: &amp; to conclude we are ſo wicked, that we baniſhe the good from our owne houſe, to the end that the euill might enter in at the gates of an other man. When the creator created the whole world, he gaue to eche thinge im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly his place: that is to wete, he placed intelligence, in the vppermoſte heauen: he placed the ſtarres, in the firmament: the planettes, in the orbes: the byrdes in the ayre: the earth on the center: the fyſhes in the water: the ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pentes, in the holes: the beaſtes in the mountaines: and to al in generallye he gaue place to reſte them ſelues in. Now let princes and great Lordes be vaine glorious ſayenge that they are Lords of the earth, for truly of all that is created, god only is the true Lord therof, becauſe the miſerable man for his part, hath but the vſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit, for if we thinke it reaſonable that we ſhould enioy the profite of that which is created: then were it more conuenient we ſhould acknowledge god to be the Lord therof.

For if man had kept his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement in Paradiſe, god had conſerued to the world y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſignorie: but the creatures whome he created for his ſeruice, are occaſion to him of great troubles: for the ingratitude of benefit, heapeth great ſorow to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret hart.

For ſo much as if I entre into the water I drowne, if I touche the fire I burne, if I cone neare a dog he biteth me, if I threaten a horſe he caſteth me, if I reſiſte the wynde it bloweth me downe, if I perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſerpent he poyſoneth me, if I ſmite the beare he deſtroieth me, and to be brief I ſaie, that the man that without pitie eateth men in his life: the wormes ſhal eate his intrailes in the graue after his death. O princes &amp; great lordes, lode your ſelues with cloth of gold, heape vp your great treaſours, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble many armies, inuente Iuſtes &amp; Torneis, ſeke your paſtimes, reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge your ſelues of your enemies, ſerue your ſelues with your ſubiectes, marrye your children to mighty kinges, &amp; ſet them in great eſtate, cauſe your ſelues to be feared of your enemies, imploye your bodies to al pleaſures, leue great poſſeſſions to your heires, rayſe ſumptuous buildinges to leaue memory of your perſons, I ſweare by him that ſhal iudge me, that I haue more compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſee your ſinfull ſoules, then I haue enuy to ſee your vicious liues. For in the end all paſtimes will vaniſhe away, and they ſhal leaue you for a gage to the hungry wormes of the earth. O if princes did conſider (though they haue bene borne princes, created &amp; noriſhed in great eſtates) that the day thei are borne, death immediatly commeth to ſeke the end of their life, and taketh them here and there when they are whole, &amp; when they are ſicke, now tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, then riſing, he neuer leaueth them one houre vntill their woful burial. Therfore ſith it is true (as in dede it is) that that whiche princes poſſeſſe in this life is but ſmall, &amp; that which they hope in the other is ſo great: truly I marueile why princes, the which ſhal lie ſo ſtraight in the graue, dare liue in ſuch &amp; ſo great largenes in their life. To be riche, to be lordes, &amp; to haue great eſtates, men ſhould not therof at al be proude, ſince they ſee how fraile mans condicion is: for in thend life is but lone, but death is enheritage.

All his armies repaired, &amp; placing gouernours in all the realmes of <hi>Aſia, Alexander</hi> departed to conquer the great <hi>India:</hi> for he had promiſed and ſworne to his gods, that through al the world there ſhould be but one Empire, and that that ſhoulde be his: and more ouer that he would neuer paſſe through any ſtraunge realme or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but it ſhould geue obedience vnto him, or els forthwith he woulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroye it. For tyrannous hartes haue neuer any regarde to the domage of another, vntill they haue obtained their wicked deſiers. <hi>Alexander</hi> then going to conquere realmes, and deſtroye prouinces, by chaunce one ſaid vnto him, that on the other ſyde of the mountaines <hi>Riphei</hi> (towardes the partes of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>) was a barbarous nation whiche were called <hi>Garamantes,</hi> as yet neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For they had no weapons, nor eſtemed them not, ſithe they had no ryches. Kinge <hi>Alexander</hi> (who for to ſubdue realmes and ſtraunge countries was very diligente and hardy, and to ſee newe thinges very deſyrous) determined not onely to ſende to ſee that countrey: but alſo to go him ſelfe in perſone, and in that place to leaue of him ſome memorye, which thing forthwith he accompliſhed. For he left them Alters, as <hi>Hercules</hi> left in <hi>Gades</hi> pillars. For mans harte is ſo ſtoute, that it trauayleth not onely to compare with many, but alſo to excell all. The Embaſſadours of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> were ſent to <hi>Garamantes,</hi> to aduertiſe them of the comming of kyng <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great, and of the terrible and cruell battayles whiche he in warres had ouercome, and to declare vnto them howe the puiſſaunt kynge <hi>Darius</hi> was ſlayne, and that all <hi>Aſia</hi> was vnder his ſubiection, and howe euery ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie did yelde them ſelues, againſt whome he neither lifted ſpere nor ſworde, becauſe all yelded to his commaundement.

they did reſiſte him. Yea and the chiefeſt of all was, that no man of all the countrey euer departed out of his houſe, finally they neither aunſwered the Embaſſadours (of <hi>Alexander</hi>) to their meſſage, nor yet ſpake one worde vnto them. And truly the <hi>Garamantes</hi> had reaſon therin, and did in that right wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely: for it is a folly for a man to perſwade thoſe men with wordes, whiche enterpryſe any thing of will. It is a marueilous matter to heare tell of the hiſtories of thoſe <hi>Garamantes</hi> (that is to ſaye) that all their houſes were of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall height, all men were appareled a lyke, the one had no more authoritie then another, in fedyng they were no gluttons, in drynking wyne they were temperate, of plees and debates they were ignoraunt, they would ſuffer no idle man to lyue among them, they had no weapons, becauſe they had no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and generally they ſpake fewe wordes, but that whiche they ſpake was alwayes true. Kyng <hi>Alexander</hi> being ſomewhat informed of thoſe <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramantes,</hi> and their lyfe, determined to ſende for them, and called them before his preſence, and inſtantly deſired them, if they had any wyſe men amonge them, to bryng them vnto hym, and by wrytinge or by worde of mouthe to ſpeake ſomewhat vnto him. For <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſuche a frende to ſage men, that all the realmes whiche he ouercame, immediatly he gaue to his men, excepting the ſages whiche he kepte for his owne perſone. <hi>Quintus Curtius,</hi> by kyng <hi>Alexander</hi> ſayeth, that a prince doeth well ſpende his treaſours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere many Realmes, onely to haue the conuerſation of one wyſe man.

When they tolde vs of thy comming into this countrie, immediatly we determined not to goe out to receyue thee, nor to prepare our ſelues to reſiſte thee, neyther to lyfte vp our eyes to behold thee, nor to open our mouthes to ſalute thee, neither to moue our handes to trouble thee, ne yet to make warre to offende thee. For grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the hate that we beare to ryches and honors, whiche thou loueſt: then the loue is that thou haſt to deſtroye men, and ſubdue countreis, which we abhorre.

For it is reaſon that princes whiche ſhall come hereafter do know, why we liuing ſo litle eſteme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is our own: &amp; why thou dieng taking ſuche paynes to poſſeſſe that whiche is an other mans.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:68"/>
O <hi>Alexander,</hi> I aſke thee one thing, and I doubte whether thou canſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere me thereunto or no: for thoſe hartes which are proude, are alſo moſte commonly blinded. Tell me whether thou goeſt? from whence thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt? what thou meaneſt? what thou thinkeſt? what thou deſireſt? what thou ſekeſt? what thou demaundeſt? what thou ſearcheſt? and what thou procureſt? and further to what realmes and prouinces thy diſordinate appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite extendeth? without a cauſe I doe not demaunde thee this queſtion, what is that thou demaundeſt, and what it is that thou ſekeſt: for I thinke thou thy ſelfe knoweſt not what thou wouldeſt. For proud and ambitious hartes knowe not what will ſatiſfie them. Sith thou art ambitious, honor deceiueth thee: ſithe thou art prodigall, couetouſnes begileth thee: ſithe thou art younge, ignoraunce abuſeth thee: and ſithe thou art proude, all the worlde laugheth thee to ſcorne: in ſuche ſorte, that thou followeſt men and not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, thou followeſt thyne owne opinion and not the counſel of another, thou embraſeſt flatterers, and repulſeſt vertuous menne. For princes and noble men had rather be commended with lies, then to be reproued with truthe. I can not tell to what ende you princes lyue ſo diſceiued, and abuſed, to haue and kepe in your pallaces mo flatterers, iuglers, and fooles: then wyſe and ſage me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For in a princes pallace if there be any which extolleth their doings, there are tenne thouſand which abhorre their tyrannies. I perceiue by theſe dedes <hi>(Alexander)</hi> that the gods wyll ſoner ende thy lyfe, then thou wilt ende thy warres. The man that is brought vp in debates, diſcentions, and ſtrife, al his felicitie conſiſteth in burning, deſtroying, and bloudſheding. I ſee thee defended with weapons, I ſee thee accompanied with tyrauntes, I ſee thee robbe the temples, I ſee thee without profite waſt the treaſours, I ſee thee murder the innocent, and trouble the pacient, I ſee thee euill willed of all, and beloued of none, whiche is the greateſt euil of al euilles. Therfore how were it poſſible for thee to endure ſuche and ſo great trauayles, vnleſſe thou art a foole, or els becauſe god hath appointed it to chaſtiſe thee. The Gods ſuffer oftetimes that men being quiet, ſhould haue ſome weighty affaires, &amp; that is not for that they ſhould be honored at this preſent, but to the end thei ſhould be puniſhed for that which is paſt. Tell me I praye thee, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is no great folly to empoueryſhe many, to make thy ſelfe alone riche? it is not (peraduenture) folly that one ſhoulde commaunde by tyranny, and that al the reſt loſe the poſſeſſion of their ſignorie? It is not folly perchaunce to leue (to the damnation of our ſoules) many memories in the world of our body? It is not folly perchaunce that the Gods approue thy diſordinate appetite alone, and condemne the wil and opinion of all the worlde beſyde? peraduenture it is not folly to winne (with the teares of the poore, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe wydowes) ſo great and bloudie victories? peraduenture it is no fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, willingly to wette the earth with the bloud of innocentes, onely to haue a vayne glory in this world? Thou thinkeſt it no folly peraduenture, god ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing deuided the worlde into ſo many people, that thou ſhouldeſt vſurpe them to thee alone? O <hi>Alexander, Alexander,</hi> truly ſuch workes proceade not from a creature noryſhed among men on the earth: but rather of one that hath bene broughte vp among the infernall furies of hell. For we are not bounde to iudge men by the good nature they haue: but by their good and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:21411:68"/>
euyll workes whiche they doe. The man is curſed (if he haue not bene curſed he ſhalbe curſed) that liueth to the preiudice of all other in this world preſent: onely to be counted couragious, ſtoute, and hardy in tyme to come. For the gods ſeldome ſuffred them to enioye that quietly in peace, whiche they haue gotten vniuſtly in the warres. I would aſke the, what inſolency moued the to rebel againſt thy lorde king <hi>Darius</hi> after whoſe death thou haſt ſought to conquere all the worlde, and this thou doeſt not as a kyng that is an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritour: but as a tyraunt that is an oppreſſor. For him properly we call a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, that without iuſtice and reaſon taketh that which is an other mans. Either thou ſearcheſt iuſtice, or thou ſearcheſt peace, or els thou ſearcheſt ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and our honor, thou ſearcheſt reſt, or els thou ſearcheſt fauoure of thy frendes, or thou ſearcheſt vengeaunce of thyne enemies. But I ſweare vnto thee <hi>(Alexander)</hi> that thou ſhalt not finde any of all theſe thinges if thou ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt by this meanes, as thou haſt begonne: for the ſwete ſuger is nor of the nature of the bitter gumbe. Howe ſhall we beleue thou ſearcheſt iuſtice, ſith againſt reaſon and iuſtice, by tyranny thou ruleſt all the earth? howe ſhall we beleue thou ſearcheſt peace, ſithe thou cauſeſt them to paie tribute which receiueth thee: and thoſe which reſiſte thee, thou handleſt them like enemies? howe can we beleue that thou ſearcheſt reſte, ſithe thou troubleſt all the worlde? How can we beleue thou ſearcheſt gentlenes, ſithe thou arte the ſcourge and ſworde of humaine fraylnes? howe can we beleue that thou ſearcheſt ryches, ſithe thine owne treaſure ſuffiſeth thee not, neyther that whiche by the vanquiſhed cometh vnto thy handes, nor that which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours offer thee? how ſhal we beleue thou ſearcheſt profite to thy fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, ſithe that of thyne olde frendes thou haſte made newe enemies? I let thee vnderſtande <hi>Alexander,</hi> that the greateſt ought to teache the leaſte, and the leaſte ought to obeye the greateſt. And frendſhippe is onely amongeſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualles. But thou, ſithe thou ſuffereſt none in the worlde to be equall and lyke vnto thee, loke not thou to haue any frende in the worlde. For princes oftymes by ingratitude loaſe faithfull frendes: and by ambicion wynne mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemies. Howe ſhall we beleue thou ſearcheſt reuenge of thine enemies, ſythe thou takeſt more vengeaunce of thy ſelfe being aliue: then thyne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies woulde take of thee if they toke the pryſoner? though perchaunce in times paſt they vſed thy father <hi>Philip</hi> euill, and haue now diſobeied thee his ſonne. It were better counſell for thee, to make them thy frendes by gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: then to confirme them ennemies by crueltie. For the noble and pitifull hartes, when they are reuenged of any, make of them ſelues a bucherye.</p>
                     <p>Wee can not with trouthe ſaye, that thy trauayles are well imployed to wynne ſuche honour, ſythe thy conuerſation and lyfe is ſo vnconſtaunt. For trulye honour conſiſteth not in that flatterers ſaye, but in that whiche Lordes doe. For the great familiaritie of the wycked, cauſeth the lyfe to be ſuſpected. Honour is not gotten by lyberall geuinge of treaſoures at hys death, but by ſpendynge it well in his lyfe. For it is a ſufficient profe, that the man whiche eſteameth renowme, dothe lytle regarde money: and it is an apparaunte token, that man, who lytle eſteameth money, greatlye regardeth his renowme.</p>
                     <p>A man wynneth not honour by murdering innocentes, but by deſtroying
<pb facs="tcp:21411:69"/>
tyrauntes: for all the armonie of the good gouernement of princes is, in the chaſtiſing of the euill, and rewarding the good. Honour is not wonne in ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king and ſnatching the goodes of an other, but in geuing and ſpendinge his owne. For there is nothing that beautifieth the maieſtie of a prince more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſhewe his noblenes in extending mercy and fauour to his ſubiectes: and geuing giftes and rewardes to the vertuous. And to conclude, I will let the know who he is, that winneth both honour in this life, and alſo a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall memory after his death: and that is not he whiche leadeth his lyfe in warres, but he that taketh his death in peace. O <hi>Alexander,</hi> I ſee thou arte younge and that thou deſireſt honour, wherfore I let thee vnderſtande that there is no man farther from honour, then he whiche procureth and deſireth the ſame. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ambicious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not obteining that which they deſire, remayne alwayes defamed: and in wynning and getting that whiche they ſearche, honour notwithſtanding will not followe them. Beleue me in one thynge <hi>Alexander,</hi> that the true honour ought through worthy deades to be deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and by no meanes to be procured: for all the honour that by tyranny is wonne, in the ende by infamy is loſt. I am ſory for thee <hi>Alexander,</hi> for I ſee thou wanteſt iuſtice, ſince thou loueſt tyranny. I ſee thou lackeſt peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou loueſt warre. I ſee thou art not ryche, becauſe thou haſt made all the worlde poore. I ſee thou lackeſt reſt, becauſe thou ſekeſt contention and debate. I ſee thou haſt no honour, becauſe that thou winneſt it by infamy. I ſee thou wanteſt frendes, becauſe thou haſte made them thyne ennemies. Finally I ſee thou doeſt not reuenge thy ſelfe of thy ennemies, becauſe thou arte (as they would be) the ſcourge to thy ſelfe. Then ſince it is ſo, why arte thou alyue in this world, ſithe thou lackeſt vertues for the which life ought to be deſired? For truly that man, whiche without his owne profite, and to the domage of another leadeth his life: by iuſtice ought forthwith to loſe his breath. For there is nothing that ſoner deſtroieth the weale publyke, then to permit vnprofitable men therein to liue. Therefore ſpeaking the trouthe, you lordes and princes are but poore. I beleue thou conquereſt the worlde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou knoweſt not thy ſuperiour therein, and beſydes that thou wylte take lyfe from ſo many, to the ende that by their death thou maieſt wynne renowme. If cruell and warrelike princes (as thou arte) ſhould inherite the liues of them whome they ſlaye, to augmente and prolonge their liues, as they doe inheritie goodes to maintayne their pryde, although it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meate, then warre were tollerable. But what profiteth the ſeruaunt to loſe his life this day, and his maiſters death to be differred but vntil the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe? O <hi>Alexander,</hi> to be deſirous to commaunde muche, hauinge reſpite to liue but litle: me thinketh it were a great foly and lacke of wyſedome. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and ambicious men whiche meaſure their workes not with the fewe daies they haue to liue, but with the arrogant and haughty thoughtes they haue to commaunde. They leade their lyfe in trauayle, and take their death with ſorowe. And the remedy hereof is, that if the wyſe man cannot obtayne that which he would, he ſhould content him ſelfe with that which he may. I let thee knowe <hi>Alexander,</hi> that the perfection of men is not to ſee much, to heare much, to knowe much, to procure much, to come to much, to trauayle much, to poſſeſſe much, and to be able to doe much: but it is to be in
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21411:69"/>
in the fauour of the gods. Finally I tell thee that that man is perfecte, who in his owne opinion deſerueth not that he hath, and in the opinion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſerueth muche more then that he poſſeſſeth. We are of this opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge vs, that he is vnworthy to haue honour, who by ſuche infamous meanes ſearcheth for it. And therfore thou <hi>Alexander</hi> deſerueſt to be ſclaue to many, becauſe thou thinkeſt to deſerue the ſignorie ouer all. By the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall gods I ſweare, I can not imagine the great miſchiefe which entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy breaſt, ſo vnrighteouſly to kill kyng <hi>Darius</hi> (whoſe vaſſale and frende thou wert onely) becauſe thou wouldeſt poſſeſſe the Empire of the whole worlde? For truly ſeruitude in peace is more worth, then ſignorie in warre. And he that ſhall ſpeake againſt that I haue ſpoken, I ſaye he is ſicke and hath loſte his taſte.</p>

Thou wilt not denie me <hi>(Alexander)</hi> but the aboundaunce that thou thy ſelfe haſt, ſemeth vnto thee litle, and the litle whiche an other man poſſeſſeth, ſemeth vnto thee muche: for the gods, to the ambicious &amp; couetous hartes gaue this for penaunce, that neither with enough nor with to muche they ſhould contente them ſelues. Thou wilt not denie me <hi>(Alexander)</hi> if in dede thy harte be couetous, that firſt the pleaſures of life ſhall ende before thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes: for where vices haue had power long time in the harte, there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ath onely and none other hath authoritie to pluck vp the rootes. Thou wilt not denie me <hi>(Alexander)</hi> that though thou haſt more then all, yet thou enioyeſt leaſt of any: for the prince that poſſeſſeth muche, is alwayes occupied in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it: but the prince that hath litle, hath time and leaſure in quiet to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye it. Thou wilt not denie me <hi>(Alexander)</hi> though thou calleſt thy ſelfe lorde of all, yet thou haſt but onely the name thereof, and others thy ſeruauntes &amp; ſubiectes haue all the profites: for the gredy and couetous hartes do trauaile and toyle to get, and in waſting that whiche they haue gotten they pyne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye. And finally <hi>(Alexander)</hi> thou wilt not denie me, that all that whiche thou haſt in the longe conqueſt gotten, is litle: and that whiche of thy wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and quietnes thou haſt loſt, is much. For the Realmes whiche thou haſt gotten are innumerable, but the cares, ſighes, and thoughtes whiche thou haſt heaped vpon thy harte are infinite. I let the knowe one thing, that you princes are poorer then the poore ſubiectes: for he is not ryche that hath more then he deſerueth, but he that deſireth to haue leſſe then that he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. And therfore princes you haue nothing, for though you abound in great treaſures: yet you are poore of good deſires. Nowe <hi>Alexander</hi> let vs come to the pointe, and caſte accompte, and let vs ſee to what ende thy conqueſt wil come. Eyther thou arte a man, or thou arte a God. And if thou be any of the
<pb facs="tcp:21411:70"/>
gods, commaunde or cauſe that we be immortall: and if thou canſt doe any ſuche thing, then take vs and our goods withall. For perpetuitie of the lyfe, by no riches can be boughte. O <hi>Alexander,</hi> I let thee vnderſtande, that therefore we ſeke not to make warre with thee: for we ſee that bothe from thee and alſo from vs, death will ſhortly take away the life. For he is a very ſimple man, that thinketh alway to remayne in an other mans houſe, as in his owne. If thou <hi>Alexander</hi> couldeſt geue vs as god euerlaſtinge life, eche man would trauayle to defende his owne houſe: but ſithe we knowe we ſhal die ſhortly, we care litle whether to thee or any other our goods &amp; riches remaine. For if it be folly to dwell in an other mans houſe as in his owne, it is a greater folly to him that loſeth his life, in taking thought and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for his goodes. Preſuppoſe that thou art not god but a man, I coniure the then by the immortal gods, and do require the that thou lyue as a man, behaue thy ſelfe as a man, and couet no more then an other man, neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre more nor leſſe then a man? for in the end thou ſhalt die as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſhal be buried as a man, and throwen into the graue, &amp; then there ſhalbe no more memorie of thee. I tolde thee before that it greued me to ſee thee ſo hardy &amp; couragious, ſo apte and ſo younge, and nowe it greueth me to ſee thee ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with the world: and that which I perceiue of thee is, that then thou ſhalt knowe thy folly, when thou ſhalt not be able to finde any remedy. For if the proude younge man before he feleth the wound, hath all redy the oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You whiche are Grecians call vs Barbarous, becauſe we enhabite the mountaines. But as touching this I ſay, that we reioyce to be Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in our ſpeache, and Greekes in our doinges: and not as you which haue the Grecians tongue, and doe Barbarous workes. For he that doth well, &amp; ſpeaketh rudely, is no barbarous man: but he which hath the tongue good, and the life euill. Sithe I haue begonne to that ende nothing remaynd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoken, I will aduertiſe thee of our lawes and life, and marueile not to here it, but deſire to obſerue and kepe it: for infinite are they whiche extolle ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous workes, but fewe are they whiche obſerue the ſame. I let thee wete <hi>(Alexander)</hi> that we haue ſhort life, we are fewe people, we haue litle landes, we haue litle goodes, we haue no couetouſnes, wee haue fewe lawes, we haue fewe houſes, wee haue fewe frendes, and aboue all we haue no enemies. For a wyſe man ought to be frende to one, and enemy to none. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all this we haue amongeſt vs great frendſhippes, good peace, great loue, much reſte, and aboue all we holde our ſelues contented. For it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to enioy the quietnes of the graue, then to liue a diſcontented life. Our lawes are fewe, but in our opinions they are good, and are in ſeuen wordes onely included as here foloweth. We ordaine that our children make no more lawes then we their fathers doe leaue vnto them: for newe lawes maketh them forget good and olde cuſtomes. We ordayne that our ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours ſhall haue no mo Gods then twoo, of the whiche the one god ſhalbe for the life, and the other for the death: for one God well ſerued is more worth, then many not rewarded. We ordaine that all be appareled with one cloth, and hoſed of one ſorte, and that the one haue no more apparell then the other: for the diuerſitie of garmentes edgendreth folly among the people.

We ordeine that whan any woman which is maried hath had thre childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that then ſhe be ſeparated from her huſband: for the aboundaunce of children cauſeth men to haue couetous hartes.

We ordeine that all men and women ſpeake the truthe in all thinges, and if any be taken in a lie, committing no other fault, that immediatly he be put to death for the ſame.

                     <p>IT is a commen and an old ſaiyng (whiche many times by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prince hath bene repeted) that in the ende all thinges are done to ſome purpoſe: for there is no worke (neither good nor euill) but he that doth it, meaneth it to ſome end. If thou demaundeſt the gardener to what ende he watereth ſo oft his plantes, he wil aunſwere thee it is to get ſome money for his herbes. If thou demaundeſt why the ryuer runneth ſo ſwift, a man wil aunſwere thee that his ende is to the ſea from whence it came. If thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeſt why the trees budde in the ſpring time, they will aunſwere, to the ende they may beare frute in harueſt. If we ſee a trauayler paſſe the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in the ſnow, the ryuers with perill, the woodes in feare, to walke in extreme heate in ſommer, to wander in the night time in the colde wynter, &amp; if by chaunce a man doth aſke one of them ſaiyng: frend whether goeſt thou? wherfore takeſt thou ſuch paines? and he aunſwereth truly ſyr I know no more then you to what ende, neither can I tell why I take ſo much paines. I aſke thee now what would a wyſe man aunſwere to this innocent tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayler? Truly (hearing no more) he would iudge him to be a foole: for he is muche infortunate, that for all his trauaile loketh for no rewarde. Therfore to our matter, a prince which is begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as an other man, borne as an other man, lyueth as an other man, dieth as an other man, and beſides al this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth all men, if of ſuche one we ſhould demaunde why god gaue him ſignory, and that he ſhould anſwere he knoweth not, but that he was borne vnto it, in ſuch caſe let euery man iudge, how vnworthy ſuche a kyng is to haue ſuch authorie. For it is vnpoſſible for a man to miniſter iuſtice, vnleſſe he knowe before what iuſtice meaneth. Let princes and noble men heare this worde, and let them imprinte it in their memory, whiche is, that when the liuing god determined to make kinges and lordes in this worlde, he did not ordeyne theym to eate more then others, to drynke more then others, to ſleape more then others, to ſpeake more then others, nor to reioyce more then others: but he created them vpon condition, that ſithe he had made them to commaunde more then others, they ſhoulde be more iuſte in their lyues then others. It is a thinge moſte vniuſte, and in the common wealth very ſclaunderous, to ſee with what authoritie a puiſſaunt man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thoſe that be vertuous: and with how much ſhame, himſelfe is bounde
<pb facs="tcp:21411:71"/>
to all vices. I knowe not what lorde he is that dare puniſhe his ſubiecte for one onely offence committed, ſeing him ſelfe to deſerue for euery deede to be chaſtiſed. For it is a monſterous thing that a blynd man ſhould take vppon him to leade him that ſeeth. They demaunded great <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor, what a king ought to do that he ſhould be beloued, feared, and not deſpyſed, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. The good prince ſhould be compared to hym that ſelleth tryacle, who if the poyſon hurte hym not, he ſelleth his triacle well. I meane there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that the punyſhement is taken in good parte of the people, which is not miniſtred by the vicious man. For he that maketh the triacle ſhall neuer be credited, vnleſſe the profe of his triacle be openly knowen and tried. I meane that the good lyfe is none other, then a fine triacle to cure the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. And to whome is he more lyke whiche with his tongue blaſeth vertues, and imployeth his deades to all vyces: then vnto the man, who in the one hand holdeth poyſon to take away lyfe, and in the other tryacle to reſiſte deathe? To the ende that a lorde be wholy obeyed, it is neceſſary that all that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth be obſerued firſte in his owne perſone: for no lorde can nor may withdrawe him ſelfe from vertuous workes. This was the aunſwere that <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor gaue, whiche in mine opinion was ſpoken more like a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, then any Romaine. When the true god came into the worlde, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed thirtie yeares onely in workes, and ſpente but two yeres and a halfe in teaching: For mans harte is perſwaded more with the worke he ſeeketh, then with the worde whiche he hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eth. Thoſe therefore whiche are lordes, let them learne and knowe of him which is the true lorde, and alſo let prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces learne why they are princes: for he is not a Pylot which neuer ſayled on the ſeas. In mine opinion if a prince will know why he is a prince, I would ſaye to gouerne well his people, to commaunde well, and to mainteyne all in Iuſtice, and this ſhould not be with wordes to make them afrayde, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by workes whiche ſhould offende them: but by ſwete wordes whiche ſhould encourage them, and by the good workes that ſhoulde edifie them. For the noble and gentle harte can not reſiſte hym, that with a louynge countenaunce commaundeth. Thoſe whiche wyll rule and make tame fierce and wylde beaſtes, doe threaten and rebuke them a hundred tymes, before they beate them once: and if they keape them tied, they ſhewe them ſondrie pleaſures. So that the wyldenes of the beaſte is taken away, onely by the gentyll and pleaſaunt vſage of the man. Therefore ſithe we haue this experience of brute and ſauage beaſtes (that is to wete) that by their wel doing, and by the gentle handling of them, they voluntarely ſuffer them ſelues to be gouerned: muche more experience we reaſonable men ought to haue, that is to knowe, that being right and well gouerned, we ſhoulde hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye and willingly obey our ſoueraigne lordes. For there is no man ſo harde harted, but by gentyll vſage will humble him ſelfe. O princes and noble men. I will tell you in one worde what the lorde oughte to doe, in the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth. Euery prince that hath his mouth full of troth, his handes open to geue rewardes, and his eares ſtopped to lyes, and his hert open to mercy, ſuch a one is happy, and the realme which hath him may wel be called proſperous, and the people maye call them ſelues fortunate.</p>
                     <p>For where as truth, liberalitie, and clemency ruleth in the harte of a prince,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21411:71"/>
there wronges, iniuries, and oppreſſions doe not reigne. And contrariwyſe where the prince hath his harte fleſſhed in crueltie, his mouthe full of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, his handes defyled with bloude, and enclineth his eares to heare lyes, ſuche a prince is vnhappy, and muche more the people the whiche by ſuche one is gouerned. For it is vnpoſſible that there is peace and iuſtice in the common wealthe, if he whiche gouerneth it, be a louer of lyes, and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. In the yere foure hundreth and fourty, before the incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, whiche was in the yere .244. of the foundation of Rome, <hi>Darius</hi> the fourthe being kyng of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> at Rome Counſulles, <hi>Thales</hi> the great Phyloſopher floryſhed in Greece, who was prince of the ſeuen renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſages, by the whiche occaſion, all the realme of Greece had and recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red renowme. For Greece boaſted more of the ſeuen ſages whiche they had, then Rome did of all the valiaunt captaines whiche ſhe nouryſhed.</p>
                     <p>There was at that tyme muche contention betwene the Romaynes and the Greekes, for ſo muche as the Greekes ſayde they were better, becauſe they had mo ſages, and the Romaines ſayde the contrary that they were better, becauſe they had alwayes mo armies. The Greekes replied againe that there were no lawes made but in Grece. And the Romaines to this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that though they were made in Greece, yet they were obſerued at Rome. The Greekes ſayde, that they had great vniuerſities to make wyſe men in. And the Romaines ſayde they had many great temples to worſhip their Gods in: for that in the ende they oughte to eſteme more one ſeruice done to the immortall goddes: then all the other commodities that myghte come vnto men. A <hi>Thebane</hi> knight was demaunded, what he thoughte of Rome and Greece? and he aunſwered, me thynkes the Romaines are no better then the Greekes, nor the Greekes than the Romaines. For the Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes glorie in their tongues, and the Romaines in their lances. But we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to vertuous workes. For one good worke is more worth, then either the longe ſtaues of the Romaines, or the eloquent tongues of the Greekes. Therefore touching my matter, this philoſopher <hi>Thales</hi> was the firſte that founde the pole (called the north ſtarre) to ſayle by, and the firſte that founde the deuiſion of the yeares, the quantitie of the Sonne and the Moone, and the firſte that ſayde ſoules were immortall, and that the worlde had a ſoule. And aboue all he would neuer mary, for the care to content the wyfe, and the thought to brynge vp the children, doth muche dull the wyttes of wyſe men. This philoſopher <hi>Thales</hi> was very poore, wherefore (ſome diſdayninge hym for his pouertie) to declare and ſhewe that he was more ryche then all they, he bought the next yeare all the Olyues he coulde get: for by Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie he knewe that in the thirde yeare there woulde be a great wante and ſcarſitie thereof throughout all the countrey. Wherefore all were compelled to come to him for Oliues, whiche at his owne price he ſolde: and in this ſorte he ſhewed them that mocked him, that he wyllingly deſpyſed ryches, and louingly imbraced pouertie. For he that willingly in this world is poore ought not to be called poore. This philoſopher <hi>Thales</hi> was a mirror amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the ſages of Grece, &amp; was greatly reuerenced of all the kinges of <hi>Aſia,</hi> &amp; high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye renowmed in Rome. And further he was ſo wiſe and had ſo redy a wit, that to all ſodaine queſtions he was demaunded, he gaue preſent aunſwere
<pb facs="tcp:21411:72"/>
furthwith: which thing declared him to be of a marueilous wytte, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was a great matter. For the moſt parte of mortal men can not tel how to aunſwere, nor what to demaunde. Many and diuerſe queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s we aſked him, as <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> affirmeth, in the anſwering wherof he ſhewed great wyſedome, the treaſure of memory, and ſubtiltie of vnderſtanding.</p>
                     <p>Firſt he was aſked what god was, <hi>Thales</hi> anſwered: of all the moſt anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities God is the moſte auncient thing. For all the auncientes paſt neither ſawe him take beginning, nor thoſe which ſhal come ſhal ſe him haue ending</p>
                     <p>Secondarily he was aſked what thing was moſte beautiful, he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the worlde: becauſe no artificiall painting could make the like.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly he was aſked what was the greateſt thing, to that he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, place, wherein all thinges doe ſtande. For the place whiche conteineth all, of neceſſitie muſt be greater then all.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly it was aſked him who knoweth moſte, he aunſwereth: that no man was wyſer then tyme, becauſe tyme alwayes onelye inuented newe thinges, and is he whiche renueth the olde.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly they aſked him, what was the lighteſt thinge, he aunſwered: the wytte of man, becauſe that without trauayle and daungers it paſſeth the ſea, to diſcouer and compaſſe all the whole earth.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly they aſked hym, what was the ſtrongeſt thing, he ſayde: the man that is in neceſſitie, for neceſſitie reuiueth the vnderſtanding of the rude, and cauſeth the cowarde to be hardy in peryll.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly they aſked him, what was the hardeſt thing to knowe, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: for man to know him ſelfe, for there ſhould be no contentions in the worlde if man knewe him ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Eightly they aſked him, what thing was ſweteſt to obteine, he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: deſire, for the man reioyſeth to remembre the paines paſt, and to obtaine to that whiche he deſyreth preſent.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly they aſked him, when the enuious man is quiet, he aunſwered: when he ſeeth his enemy dead or vtterly vndone. For truly the proſperitie of the enemy is a ſharpe knife to the enuious harte.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly he was aſked, what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhuld do to liue vprightly, he anſwered: to take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel to him ſelf, which he geueth to an other. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vndoing of al men is, that they haue plenty of councell for others, &amp; want for them ſelues.</p>
                     <p>The eleuenth queſtion was, they aſked him what profite he hath that is not couetous, wherunto he anſwered: that ſuch a one is deliuered from the tormentes of his auarice, and beſides that he recouereth frendes for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone: for ryches tormenteth the auaricions becauſe he ſpendeth them not.</p>
                     <p>The .xii. they aſked him what the prince ſhould doe to gouerne others, he anſwered: he ought firſte to gouerne him ſelfe, and then afterwardes to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne others. For it is vnpoſſible the rodde ſhould be right, wher the ſhadow is croked. By the occaſion of this laſt aunſwere I did bring in here all theſe queſtions, to the end princes and rulers might ſee, how that euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is as the rod of iuſtice, and that the common wealth is none other but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of them, which in al, and for all ought to be right. For immediatly it is perceiued in the ſhadowe of the common wealth, if the iuſtice or lyfe of him whiche gouerneth be out of his order. Therefore concluding all that I haue ſpoken before, if a prince would aſke me why he is a prince, I would tel him
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21411:72"/>
in one word only, that he which is the highe prince hath made you a prince in this world, to the end you ſhould be a diſtroyer of heretykes, a father of orphanes, a frend of ſages, a hater of malicyous, a ſcourge of tirauntes, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of good, a defender and protector of Churches, a plague of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, a onely louer and frend of the common wealth, and aboue al you ought to be an vpright myniſter of iuſtice: beginning firſt with your parſon &amp; pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, for in all thinges amendment is ſuffered, except in iuſtice, which ought to be equal betwene the prince and the common wealth.</p>

And to the end we may deſcribe the miſtical body, which is the Empire in the fourme and ſhape of an natural man, you ſhal vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that the head which is aboue al, is the prince which commaundeth al: the eyes wherby we ſe, are the good men in the commonwealth whom we folow: the eares that heare what we ſay, are the ſubiects which do what we commaund them: the tongue wherwith we ſpeake, are the ſages of whom we here the lawes &amp; doctrines: the heeres which groweth on our heads, are thoſe which are vexed &amp; greued, and that demaund iuſtice of the kinge: the hands &amp; the armes, are the knightes which reſiſt the enemyes: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feete which ſuſteineth the membres, are the tillers of the ground which geueth meate to al eſtates: the hard bones that ſuſteineth the feble &amp; ſoft fleſh, are the ſage me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which endure the trauaile of the common wealthe: the harts which we ſee not outwardly, are the priuye councellours: Finally the necke that knitteth the bodye with the head, is the loue of the kinge and of the Realme, whiche make a common wealth. All the wordes aboue named ſpake <hi>Plutarche</hi> the greate, to <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperoure. And trulye the inuencion and grace of him, proceaded of a hygh and deape vnderſtanding: for the heade hath thre properties, whiche are verye neceſſarye for the gouernoure of the common wealth. The firſt is, that euen as the head is of al other members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hygheſt: ſo the aucthoritie of the prince, exceadeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſtates of al others. For the prince only hath aucthoritie to commaund, and al others are bound to obey. Admyt therbe many ſtout, rich, &amp; noble men in the comon wealth:
<pb facs="tcp:21411:73"/>
yet al ought to know and acknowledge ſeruice to the Lord of the ſame. For the noble and worthy princes, do dayly eaſe many of dyuerſe ſeruices, but they wil neuer except anye from their loyaltie, and allegeaunce. Thoſe which are valiaunt, and mightie in a Realme, ſhould contente themſelues with that, wherwith the battilments doe vpon a caſtel, (that is to wete) that they are higher then the rampers wherin men walke on the walles, and lower then the pinakelles which are in the toppe. For the wiſe man of highe eſtate, ought not to regard the prince which is the highe pinacle, but ought to loke on the alleys which are the poore comfortles. I would ſpeake a worde and it greueth me (that is) wheras great lordes deſire in the common wealthe to commaund, is like vnto him that holdeth his armes and handes ouer his head. For al that I haue herde, and for all that I haue redde, and alſo for al that hath chaunced in my time, I counſell, admoniſhe, and warne all thoſe which ſhal come after this time, that if they wil enioy their goodes, if they will liue in ſafegard, and if they wil be deliuered from tirannye, and liue quiete in the common wealth, that they do not agre to haue in one realme, aboue one king, and one lord. For it a general rule, where there are manye rulers in a common wealth, in the end both it and al muſt periſhe. We ſe by experience, that nature fourmed vs with many ſynewes, many bones, with muche fleſhe, with many fingers, and with many teeth, and to all this one onely body had but one head, wherfore though with many eſtates the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth is ordained: yet with one prince alone it ought to be ruled, If it conſiſted in mens handes to make a prince, they would then alſo haue the auctoritie to put him downe: but being true, as it is moſt true in dede, that the prince is conſtituted by God, none but god alone oughte to depriue and depoſe him of his eſtate, but thinges that are meaſured by the deuine iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, man hath no power with raſor to cut them. I know not what ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion the meane can haue, neyther what enuie the loweſt can haue, nor what pride the higheſt can haue, to commaund, and not to obey, ſince we are ſure, that in this miſticall bodye of the common wealth he which is moſt worth, ſhalbe no more eſtemed: then the fingers or paringe of the nayles, or the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an heere from the heade, Let euery man therefore liue in peace in his common wealth, and acknowledge obedience vnto his prince: &amp; he that wil not do ſo, away with him: for euen as the onely offence procedeth of hym, ſo let the only paine reſt vpon him. For it is an old ſaying, that he that taketh vp the ſworde againſte his maiſter, wil ſhortlye after lay his heade at his feete. The ſeconde condicion is, to compare the kinge to the hed, becauſe the hed is the beginning of mans life. The moſte part of thinges that euer god created, accordinge to their natures worke their operacions, as in growing highe, and towardes the heauens. We ſe the vapors aſcend high, the plantes groweth highe, the trees budde out on height, the ſourges of the ſea mount highe, and the nature of fier is alwayes to aſcend and mount on highe, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the miſerable man groweth downeward and is brought low by reaſone of the feble and fraile fleſh, which is but earth and commeth of earth, and liueth on earth: &amp; in the end returneth to earth againe from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he came. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith well, that man is but a tre planted with the rootes vpward, whoſe roote is the head, and the ſtocke is the bodye, the braunches are the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21411:73"/>
armes, the barcke is the fleſh, the knottes are the bones, the ſappe is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart, the rottennes is malice, the gumme is loue, the flowers are words, and the frutes are the good workes. To make the man to go vprightlye, his heade ſhould be wher his feete are, and the feete wher the head is, ſyth the head is the roote, &amp; the feete are the bowes: but in this caſe I ſweare, that we are, correſpondaunte to our beginning, for if our fleſhe be planted contrarywiſe, ſo much more contrary we haue our life ordered. Therfore concerning our matter I ſay, that the Realme hath no leſſe his beginning of the kinge, then the kinge of the realme: whiche thinge is plainlye ſeene, for that the king gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth lawes and inſtitucions to a Realme, and not the Realme to the kyng. The giftes and benefites which the king geueth, commeth to the Realme, &amp; not from the realme to the king. To inuent warres, to take trewſe, to make peace, to reward the good, and to puniſh the euyl, proceadeth from the king to the Realme, and not to the contrary. For it apperteineth onlye to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of a prince, to commaund and ordeine: and to the common wealth to autoriſe and obey him. As in a great ſumptuous bylding it is more daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, wher one ſtone of the foundacion doth fall, then when .x. thouſand ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les faule from the top: ſo he ought more to be blamed for onely diſobedience commytted and done to the king, and his iuſtice, then for fiue thouſand of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences againſt the common wealth. For we haue ſene of a lytle diſobedience, a great ſlaunder aryſe in a common wealthe. O it is a goodly matter for a prince to be beloued of his ſubiectes, and a goodly thing alſo for the realme to be feareful of their king. For the king that is not loued of his ſubiectes, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not liue in peace nor quyet: and the realme that is not feareful of their king, can not be wel gouerned. The realme <hi>Sicilia</hi> had alwayes mightye Princes and gouernours: for in auncient time it was gouerned by vertuous princes, or els by cruel &amp; malicious tirauntes. In the time of <hi>Senerus</hi> the Emperour, ther reigned in <hi>Cecil,</hi> a king called <hi>Lelius Pius,</hi> who had ſo many good things in him, that throughout al the empire he was very wel eſtemed, and chiefly for foure lawes amongeſte others hee ordayned in that Realme, whiche were theſe folowing.</p>
                     <p>We ordaine, that if amongeſte equall perſones there bee anye iniuries offered, that they be puniſhed, or els that they be diſſembled: for wher enuye is roted betwene two, it profiteth more to reconſile their good willes, then to puniſh their perſones. We ordaine that if the greateſt be offended by the leaſt, that ſuch offence be litle reproued, &amp; wel puniſhed: for the audacite &amp; litle ſhame, &amp; alſo the diſobedience of the ſeruaunt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiſter, ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but by greuous puniſhment. We ordaine, that if any reſiſt or ſpeake againſt the comaundement of a prince, that preſently (without delay) he ſuffer death before them al: for they may boldly by the way of ſupplycacion, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently declare their grieffes, and not by ſlaunder rebellyouſly dyſobeye their lordes. We ordaine, that if anye rayſe the common wealthe agaynſte the Prince, hee that canne fyrſte ſtrycke of hys heade, maye lawefullye wythe oute fearynge anye daunger of punyſhemente: for hys heade is iuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye taken frome hym, that woulde there ſhoulde be manye heades in the common wealthe. Of all this before ſpoken, <hi>Herianus</hi> is the authoure, in hys fourthe booke of the kynges of <hi>Sicille</hi> where hee putteth manye and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:74"/>
ſinguler lawes and cuſtomes which the auncientes had to the great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of theſe that be preſent. For truly the auncientes did not onlye exceade theſe that be preſent in their workes and doings: but alſo in ſpeaking pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found wordes. Therfore returning to our matter, mans life greatly trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth alwayes to defend the head, in ſuch ſort that a man would rather ſuffer his hand to be cut of, then to ſuffer a wound to be made in his head. By this compariſon I meane that a fault in a common wealth, is a cut, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kereth &amp; feſtereth, but the diſobedyence to a prince is a wound which forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with killeth. Yf a man did aſke me what vnion princes ſhoulde haue with their common wealth, I would anſwere them in this ſort, that the wealth of the king &amp; realme conſiſteth herein. That the king ſhold accompany w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the good, &amp; banniſhe the euil. For it is vnpoſſible that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king ſhould be beloued of the common wealth, if the companye he hath about him be reputed vicious. He ſhould alſo loue his Realme without diſſymulacion, &amp; the realme ſhould ſerue him vnfainedly: for the common wealth, which knoweth it to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of their Prince, ſhal not find any thing to hard for his ſeruice. Further that the kinge vſe his ſubiectes as his children, and that the ſubiectes ſerue him as a father: for generallye the good father can not ſuffer his children to be in daunger, neyther the good children wil diſſobeye their father. Alſo the king ought to be iuſt in his commaundementes, and the ſubiectes faithful. For if it be a good thinge in their ſeruices, to liue vnder a iuſt law, it is much better to lyue vnder a iuſt king. Alſo the king ought to defende his ſubiectes from enemies, &amp; they ought wel to pay him his tribute: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince who de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fended his people from enemyes and tirannye worthely deſerueth to be lord of al their goodes. Alſo the king ought to kepe his common wealth in quiet, and ought not to be preſumptous of his perſone: ſo the prince whych is not feared &amp; wel eſtemed, ſhal neuer be obeyed in his commaundement. Finally I ſay, that the good king ought to do his Realme pleaſure, and the faithfull ſubiectes ought to endeuour them ſelues neuer to diſpleaſe their kinge. For that prince cannot be called vnfortunate, who of his common wealthe, is loued and obeyed.</p>

Cap. xxxvii.</head>
                     <p>WE haue ſhewed, how the prince is the common wealthe, and nowe we wil let you vnderſtand another notable thing, which is this: that as all ſences are in the heade, ſo oughte all eſtates to be in princes. For the verues which are in many ſpred and ſkattered: ſhould be in one prince founde and gathered. The office of the feete is not to ſe, but to goe: the handes office is not to heare, but to labour: the ſhoulders not to feele, but to beare: all theſe offices are not ſemely for the membres, which are his ſubiectes, but apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth to the king alone to exerciſe them. For the head to haue eyes, and no other members, meaneth nought els, but that onlye to the prince, and to none other, apparteyneth to know all: for <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> knewe all thoſe of his hoſt, and named them by their proper names. I counſel, and admoniſhe you, O you princes, which ſhal heare, ſee, or read this thing, that you do reioyce to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21411:74"/>
viſite, and to be viſited, to ſee, &amp; to be ſene: to talke, &amp; to be talked with: for the thinges whych wyth your eyes you ſe not you cannot perfectly loue. A man ought alſo to know, that the head only hath eares, to note, that to the king, and to none other, apperteyneth to here all, and to kepe the gates open for them that haue any ſewtes: for it is no ſmall matter to a common wealth, to haue and obtaine of the prince eaſye audyence. <hi>Helius Spartiahus</hi> commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth highly <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperour, that when he was on horſebacke to go to the warres, alyghted againe to here the complainte of a poore Romaine, which thing was meruelouſly noted amongeſt al the Romaines: for if men were not vaine, they ſhould geue a Prince more honoure for one worke of iuſtice, then for the victorye of many battayles. Truly to a king it is no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but rather paine and griefe, and alſo for the common people auoyaunce, that the prince alwayes ſhould be encloſed and ſhut vp. For the prince which ſhutteth hys gates agaynſte his ſubiectes, cauſeth theym not to open there hartes wyllynglye to obey hym. How many and great ſlaunders doth their ariſe in the common wealth, only for that the prince ſomtime wil not ſpeake. <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> was Emperoure, and the heade of all the empyre, and becauſe he was muſing of weighty matters, &amp; would not herken to him which would haue reueled the treaſon conſpired agaynſt him, was that ſame day with .33. wondes in the Senate murdered. The contrarye is red of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the Emperoure, who was ſo famyliar with all men, that howbeit he was chiefe of al, and that the affaires which now are deuided to many, depended then only of hym: yet he neuer had porter of his gate, nor chamberlayne of hys chamber, and for any affaires that euer he had to do with manye men (were they neuer ſo great) he was neuer longer then one daye about them. For trulye (if I may ſay it) that prynce is not worthy to be beloued, that is ſcarſe of hys wordes vnto thoſe, whych faythfully ſerue hym with workes: for wyſe prynces ſhould be quicke in hearing, and graue in determining. For many come to ſpeake wyth princes, which thinke that their counſelles ſhal not be accepted, nor their requeſtes graunted, yet they deſire importunately to be hard, &amp; of trouth the prince ought to here them, for the heuy hart with ſorowes burdened, when it is heard, is greatly lightned, I wold know why the ſence of ſmellynge is only in the head, and not in the feete, nor in the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, neyther in any other part of the body? truly it ſignifyeth nought els, but that it apperteineth to the Prince (which is head of al) to here and know al, &amp; therfore it is neceſſarye he be informed of all their lyues. For the prynce can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not gouerne his common wealth well, vnleſſe he knoweth the perticulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties therof. It is neceſſarye that the prince knowe the good, to the ende he may prefarre them: for that common wealth is greatly ſlaundered, wherin the euyll are not puniſhed, nor the good honoured. It is neceſſary the prynce know the ſage, to counſel with them: for the auncyente Romaynes neuer admitted any for councellours but thoſe which w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> philoſophy wer adorned. It is neceſſary he know the euyl for to correct them: for ther is a great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in that common wealth, wher without any ſhame the wickednes of the wycked, is cloked and vnpunyſhed. It is neceſſarye the prynce doe know thoſe that are able to teache: for in the court of the Romayne princes, there were alwayes captaines, which taught &amp; ſhewed how to handel their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:75"/>
and wiſe men which taught &amp; inſtructed them ſcienſes. It is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the prince know the poore of his realme, for to ayde and ſuccor them: for the princes ſhould ſo gouerne their common wealth, that amonge the riche nothing ſhould abound, nor among the poore any thing ſhould want. It is neceſſarie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince know the preſumptuous, &amp; malicious, for to humble them: for the poore by enuye, and the rich by pride, heretofore haue deſtroyed great common wealthes. It is neceſſarie the prince know the peace kepers, for to kepe and maintaine theim in peace: for it is the deutye of a prince, to plucke downe the ſtout ſtomackes of the proude, and to giue winges of fauour to the humble. It is neceſſary that the prince know them which haue done him ſeruice, to the end they may be rewarded according to their merites: for the ſtout and noble hart for litel fauoure ſhewed vnto him, bindeth himſelfe to accompliſhe great thinges. It is neceſſarie the prince knowe the noble men of his realme, to the end that at time of neade, he mighte retaine and take them into his ſeruice: for it is but mete, that the man which is adorned with vertue, and nobilitie, be preferred aboue all other in the common wealthe. Finally I ſay, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince ſhould know the murmerers, neuer to creadite them: and likewiſe to know thoſe that tell the truth, alwayes to loue them. For none ſhould be more familyar, then the wiſe man to gyue him counſell, and the vpright man to tel the truth. And contrarywiſe none ought to be more abhorred of the prince, then the flatterer, and ignoraunt man. O how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie it is for a prince, to know and vnderſtand all things in his Realme, to thend no man mighte deceiue him, as they do now a dayes. For the moſte part of princes are deceiued, for none other cauſe, but for that they wyll not be councelled, and informed by wiſe &amp; diſcrete men. For many croutche vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to princes with faire words (as though they ment him good ſeruice) but their entent is contrarie, by dyſceite to get an office, and ſeke their owne profite. <hi>Helius Spartianus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> (the xxv. Emperoure of Rome) was a man very ſtout, and vertuous, and amongeſt all other thinges they greatly commended him, becauſe in his chamber he had a famyliar booke, wherin he had wryten all the nobles of his Realme, and Empire, and when any office was voide, they ſayd nothinge els to him but that it was voide: for the Emperour did not graunt it to him that ſought it, but (by the ſecrete informacion of hys booke) to him that deſerued it. I wyl ſweare, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther princes ſhal affirme the ſame, that thoughe they erre in dyſtributynge their offices, they do not erre for that they would erre. Yet they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye but that they erre greuouſly, for that they wil not be informed, &amp; though they be informed, yet it were better they were not informed at al: for he ſhal neuer geue the Prince good nor parfect counſel, whych (by that counſel) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to haue ſome proper intereſt, The chiefeſt thynge of Prynces is to know how to choſe the beſt in proſperytye, and how to auoyde the worſte in aduerſytye, and to know alſo how to rewarde the good men lyberallye. And truly in thys caſe Prynces ſhould haue more conſideracyon to them, which haue done them worthy ſeruyce, then to the importunytyes of hys famyliar frendes: for he ſhal thanke the ſeruaunt that procureth it, but not the Prynce that geueth it. Al that we ſpeake is to no other purpoſe, but to perſwade, that ſyth the prince is Lord of al, it is reaſon that he be informed
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21411:75"/>
of the ſtate and condicion of al. For otherwiſe he ſhalbe diſceyued by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand malicious harts, which are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common wealth. Therfore to conclude I ſay if the prince be not informed of the life of al, the ſkinne wil ſeame fleſhe, the braine meate, the ſtraw corne, the braſſe gold, the gaull hony, &amp; the dreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges good wine, I meane in deuyding his offices, thinking to hit the white, he ſhal ofttymes myſſe the butte.</p>

                     <head>¶Of the great feaſt the Romaynes celebrated to the god <hi>Ianus</hi> the firſt day of Ianuarye, and of the bountye and liberalitye of the Emperoure <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the ſame daye. Cap. xxxviii.</head>
                     <p>AMonge the Solempne Feaſtes whych the auncient Romaynes vſed, this was one to the God <hi>Ianus,</hi> the which they celebrated the firſt daye of the yere, which now is the firſte of Ianuarye: for the Hebrues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne their yeare in March, and the Romaynes beganne at Ianuarye. The Romaynes painted this GOD with two faces, ſygnyfyenge therby the end of the yeare paſt, and the beginning of the yeare preſent. To this god <hi>Ianus</hi> was dedicated in the cytie of Rome a ſumptous Temple whiche they called the Temple of peace, and was in great reuerence throughout all the citye: for the citezens on this daye offered greate giftes and ſacrifices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhould defend them from their enemyes. For there is no nacion nor people to whom warre euer ſucceded ſo proſperouſlye, but that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lyue in peace then in warre. When the Romaine Emperours wente to the warres or came from the warres, firſt they vyſited the Temple of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſecondarilye the Temple of the veſtall virgins, and thirdely they vyſited the Temple of the God <hi>Ianus:</hi> bycauſe there was a law in Rome that the Emperour ſhould at his going forth to the warres vyſite the Temple of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> laſt of al, and at his retourne againe, the Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> firſt. And let them that be deſierous of antiquities here know, that when the Emperour ſhould go to the warres, in the Temple of the goddeſſe <hi>Veſta</hi> they put vpon his ſhoulders the royall mantell, and in the Temple of <hi>Iupiter</hi> al the ſenators kiſſed his foote, and in the Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> the Conſuls kiſſed his arme. For ſince the time that the cruell <hi>Sylla,</hi> cauſed thre thouſand neighbours to dye which kiſſed his right hand, they neuer after kiſſed the handes of any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in Rome. Therfore ſith the gentyles woulde not iſſue out of Rome before that firſt they had taken the benediction of thoſe vaine Gods: how muche more ought Chriſtian Princes to do it, which know well that their Temples are conſecrated to the true God, and ordayned for his ſeruice only. For the man that forgetteth God, and commytteth his affaires to men, ſhal ſee how his buſines wil thriue in the handes of men. Therefore procedinge forth, the day wherin the feaſt of the god <hi>Ianus</hi> was celebrated, euery man left his worke &amp; reioyſed through al the ſtreates of Rome, no more then leſſe then in the feaſtes of <hi>Iupiter, Mars, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Berecinthia:</hi> For the feaſtes of the other goddes (ſith they were many in nomber) were not celebrated, but in certaine places in Rome. The Romaynes on that day put on their beſte apparell, for they had a cuſtome in Rome, that he whych had not that daye chaunge of apparell to honoure the feaſte, ſhould eyther go out of Rome or els kepe themſelues locked in his houſe. That daye, they ſet on their houſes
<pb facs="tcp:21411:76"/>
many lyghtes, and made greate bondfiers before their dores, and had ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and many playes, and paſtimes, for the feaſtes of vaine men are more to delight their bodies, then to reforme their minds. They watched al the night in the Temples, and alſo they deliuered all the priſoners which were inpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned for dette, and with the common treaſures paied their dettes. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more they had a cuſtome in Rome, that they ſhoulde ſuſteine all the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours (whiche were fallen into pouertie) with the goodes of the common wealthe. They had that daye tables ſet before their dores, furniſhed with all ſortes of meates, ſo that that whiche remayned and was left, was more worth: then that which was eaten. For vaine glorious men, auaunt theym ſelues more of that, which in bankettes and feaſtes is left, then they do of that whyche is eaten. They ſought all that day for poore men, bycauſe they ſhoulde be prouyded of all things. For it was an auncient lawe, that none ſhould be ſo hardy to make any open feaſt, excepte firſt he had prouided for all them of his ſtreate. The Romaynes thought that if they ſpend lyberallye that day, the god <hi>Ianus</hi> would deliuer them from pouertye, becauſe he was the God of the temperall goodes. And they ſayde further, that the GOD <hi>Ianus</hi> was a God very thankeful, &amp; acknowledged the ſeruyces whych were donne vnto hym, and beleued earneſtlye that if they ſpente frelye for hys ſake, he woulde requyte it doble In the feaſte of this God <hi>Ianus</hi> manye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions were made, not all togethers, but the Senate wente by theym ſelues, the Cenſours by them ſelues, the people by them ſelues, the Matro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes by theym ſelues, the maydens by them ſelues, the veſtal virgins by them ſelues, &amp; al the ſtraunge Imbaſſadours went wyth the captiues in proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. There was a cuſtome in Rome, that the ſame day the Emperour ſhould were the imperyal robe, al the captiues which could touche him with their hands were delyuered, and all the tranſgreſſours pardoned, the exules and outlawryes were called againe. For the Romayne princes were neuer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente in any feaſt, but they ſhewed ſome noble example of mercy, or gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes towardes the people. At this time <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was Emperoure of Rome, and maried with the beautiful lady <hi>Fauſtina,</hi> who (in the feaſt of <hi>Ianus</hi>) leuing in proceſſion the company of the Senatours came into the proceſſion of the captiues, the which eaſelye touched his robe, wherby they obtained ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie the which they ſo greatly deſired: I ſay deſired for truly the captiue is contented with a ſmall thinge. And becauſe ther is no good thing by anye good man done, but immediatlye by the wycked it is repined at, this deede was ſo contrary to the euyl, as ioyfull to the good. For there is nothing, be it neuer ſo good, nor ſo wel done, but forthwith it ſhalbe contraried of them that be euyl.</p>
                     <p>Of this thing I haue ſene by experience (in this miſerable life: ſondry exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euen as amonge the good one only is noted to be chiefe: ſo lykewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monge the euyll one is noted principall aboue the reſt. And the worſt I find herein is, that the vertuous do not ſo much glory of their vertue: as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil and malicious hath ſhame and diſhonour of their vyce: for vertue natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally makleth a man to be temperate and quyet, but vice maketh him to be diſſolute and rechleſſe. This is ſpoken, becauſe in the Senate of Rome there was a Senatour called <hi>Fuluius,</hi> whoſe berd &amp; heeres wer very white, but in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21411:76"/>
malyce, he was moſt cankered blacke: ſo that for his yeres he was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Rome of many, &amp; for his malyce he was hated of al. The Senatour <hi>Fuluius</hi> made frendes in the time of <hi>Adrian</hi> to ſuccede in the empire, and for this cauſe he had alwayes <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> for his competytour, and wherſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he came he alwayes ſpake euyll of him as of his mortall enemye. For the enuyous hart can neuer geue a man one good word. This Senatours hart was ſo puffed with enuye: that he ſeing <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> to obtaine the empire being ſo yong, &amp; that he being ſo old could not attaine therunto: ther was no good that euer <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> did in the common wealth openly, but it was grudged at by <hi>Fuluius,</hi> who ſoughte alwayes to deface the ſame ſecretlye. It is the nature of thoſe whiche haue their hartes enfected with malyce, to ſpitte out their poyſon with woordes of ſpite. Oft times I haue muſed which of theſe 2. are greater, the dewtye the good haue to ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the euyl, or els the audacitie the euyl haue to ſpeake againſt the good. For in the world ther is no brute beaſt ſoo hardye, as the euill man is that hath loſt his fame. O would to God the good to his deſyre had aſmuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to do good workes, as the euyl hath ſtrength to his affection, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe wicked dedes. For the vertuous man findeth not one hand to helpe him in vertue to worke, yet after he hath wrought it, he ſhall haue a thouſand e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyl tongues againſt his honeſt doynges to ſpeake. I would all thoſe which rede this my writyng, would call to memorye this word (whiche is) that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong euyl men the chefeſt euil is, that after they haue forgotten them ſelues to be men, and exiled both trouth &amp; reaſon, then with al their might they go againſt trouth and vertue, with their woordes, and againſte good deedes with their tongues: for though it be euyl to be an euyll man, yet it is muche worſe not to ſuffer an other to be good, which aboue al thinges is to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and not to be ſuffered. I let you wete and aſſure you, you princes &amp; noble men, that you in working vertuous dedes ſhal not want ſlaunderous tongues, and though you be ſtout, yet you muſt be pacyente to breake their malyce. For the noble hart fealeth more the enuye of an other, then he doothe the labour of his owne body. Princes ſhould not be diſmayde, neither ought they to meruayle, though they be told of the murmuring at their good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: For in the end they are men, they liue with men, and cannot eſcape the miſeryes of men. For ther was neuer prince in the world yet ſo high, but he hath bene ſubiect to malycious tongues. Trulye aman ought to take great pytie of Princes, whether they be good or euyll: for if they be euil, the good hate them: &amp; if they be good, the euyl immediatly murmureth againſt them. The Emperoure <hi>Octauian</hi> was very vertuous, yet greatly perſecuted with enuyous tongues, whoe on a tyme was demaunded (ſince he dyd good to al men) why he ſuffered a few to murmour againſt him? he aunſwered: you ſe my frends, he that hath made Rome free from enemyes, hath alſo ſet at lybertie the tongues of malycious men. For it is not reaſon that the harde ſtones ſhould be at libertie, and the tender ſtones tyed. Truly this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour <hi>Octauian</hi> by his wordes declared himſelfe to be a wiſe man, and of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, and lightly to waye both the murmuringes of the people, and alſo the vanities of their words, which thing truly a wiſe &amp; vertuous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to do. For it is a general rule, that vices continually ſeke defendours, and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:77"/>
vertues alwayes getteth Enemyes. In the booke of lawes the deuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith wel, that the euil were alwayes double euyl<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they weare wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons defenſiue, to defende their malicious purpoſe: and alſo cary weapons offenſiue, to bleamyſhe the good workes of others. Vertuous men ought with much ſtudy to folow the good, and with more dilygence to flye from the euil. For a good man maye commaund al other vertuous men, with a becke of his finger, but to kepe himſelfe only from one euyl man, he had nede both hands, feete, and frends. <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> the Thebaine ſayd, that he felt no greater torment in the world then this, that his proper honour ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the Imaginacion of an other: for it is a cruell thinge, that the life and honour of one that is good, ſhould be meaſured by the tongue of an other that is euyl. For as in the forge, the coles can not be kindled withoute ſparkes, nor as corruption can not be in the ſynckes without ordure: ſo he that hath his hart fre from malyce, his tongue is occupied alwaies in ſwete and pleaſaunt communication. And contrary wiſe, out of his mouth, whoſe ſtomacke is infected with malyce, proceadeth always wordes bitter, &amp; full of poyſon. For if out of a rotten fornayſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyre burneth it is impoſſible that the ſmoke ſhould be cleare. It is but a ſmal time, that (in prophane loue) he that is enamored, is able to refraine his loue, and muche leſſe time is the wrathfull man able to hyde his wrath. For the heuy ſighes are tokens of the ſorowful hart, and the words are thoſe that diſcloſe the malycious man. <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> ſayth in the firſt booke of <hi>Ceſars,</hi> that the Emperoure <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was very vertuous in all his workes, ſage in knowledge, iuſte in Iudgement, mercifull in puniſhment, but aboue all thinges he was wiſe in diſſemblyng, &amp; herein he was very diſcrete: for ther was neuer pacyent man but proſpered wel in all his affayres. We ſe that throughe pacience and wiſedome, many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyl thinges become reaſonable, and from reaſonable are brought to good, &amp; from good to excellent. The contrary happeneth to them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> are moued more then they nede, for the man which is not pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, loketh not yet for any good ſucceſſe in his affayres, though they are iuſt. The Emperour <hi>Marcus</hi> ofttimes was wont to ſay, that <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> wanne the empire by the ſweard, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was Emperour by Inheritaunce, <hi>Caligula</hi> came to it, becauſe his father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Germany, <hi>Nero</hi> gouerned it with tyranny, <hi>Titus</hi> was Emperour, for that he ſubdued <hi>Iuery,</hi> the good <hi>Traian</hi> came to the empire by his clemency &amp; vertue, but I (ſayth he) obtained the empire through pacience only. For it is a greater pacience, to ſuffer the Iniuries of the malicious: then to diſpute with the ſage in the vniuerſity. And this Emperour ſaide further in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of the empire, I haue profited more throughe pacience, then by ſcience: for ſcience only profiteth for the quyetnes of the parſon, but pacyence profiteth the parſon, &amp; the common wealthe. <hi>Iulius Capitolinus</hi> ſayth, that the Emperour <hi>Antonius Pius</hi> was a prince very pacyent, &amp; in ſuch ſort, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes being in the Senate, he ſaw both thoſe which loued him, &amp; alſo thoſe that were againſt him with the people when they did rebel: yet his pacience was ſo great, that neyther his frends for the vnthankfulnes of them ſelues, remayned ſad: neither his enemyes for any diſpleaſure by him done did at any time co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine. Meaning therfore in this chapter to ioyne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay that as the Emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> put himſelfe amongeſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:21411:77"/>
captyues, &amp; that this dede in Rome of al men was commended: the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <hi>Fuluius</hi> could not refraine from ſpeaking, for that he had not the wit to endure it, wherfore as it were ſcoffing he ſpake theſe wordes to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Lord I meruayle why thou yeldeſt thy ſelfe to al, which thing for the reputacion of the Empyre cannot be ſuffered, for that it is not decent for thy maieſtie. The Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſeing and hearing that in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of them all, the ſenatour <hi>Fuluius</hi> ſpake vnto him theſe wordes, he toke it paciently and with pleaſaunt countenaunce ſayd. The queſtions the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour <hi>Euluius</hi> proponeth, let it be for to morow, becauſe my aunſwere may be the ryper, and his coller the quieter. Therfore the next day folowing, the Emperour <hi>Marcus</hi> came into the hyghe capitoll (as <hi>Pulio</hi> declareth in the life of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>) and ſpake theſe words.</p>

Cap. xxxix.</head>
                     <p>FAthers conſcript, and ſacred Senat, I wold not yeſter daye aunſwere to that that the Senatour <hi>Fuluius</hi> ſpake vnto me, becauſe it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what late, and for that we were long in ſacrifices, I thought that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time nor place was conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to aunſwere therunto. For it is a ſigne of a lytle wiſedome, &amp; of great folye, for a man to aunſwere ſodainly to euerye queſtion. The libertie that vndiſcret men haue to demaunde, the ſelfe ſame priuiledge hath the ſage for to aunſwere: For though the demaund procede of ignoraunce, yet the aunſwere oughte to procede of wyſedome. Trulye wiſe men were wel at eaſe, if to euery demaund they ſhoulde aunſwere the ſimple and malicious: who (for the moſt part) demaund more to vexe other men, then for to profyte themſelues, more for to proue, than to know, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſe men ought to diſſemble at ſuch demaundes. For the ſages oughte to haue their eares open to heare, and their tongue tyed becauſe they ſhould not ſpeake. I let you know (auncyent fathers, &amp; ſacred ſenate) that the lytle whyche I knowe, I learned in the yle of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> in <hi>Capua,</hi> and in <hi>Tharente.</hi> And al tutors told me, that the Intencion and end of men to ſtudy, was only to know to gouerne them ſelues amongeſt the malicious. For ſcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence profiteth nothing els, but to know how to kepe his lyfe wel ordered, &amp; his tongue wel meaſured. Therfore I proteſt to god that which I will ſay before your ſacred preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, I wil not ſpeake it of any malice or ill wil: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to aunſwere vnto that which toucheth the auctoritie of my perſon. For the thynges which touch the honour, ought firſt by word to be aunſwered, &amp; afterwards by ſword to be reuenged. Therfore now beginning my matter, &amp; addreſſing my words to the <hi>Fuluius,</hi> and to that which thou ſpakeſt vnto me, aſking why I ſhew my ſelfe ſo to all men, I aunſwere the. It is becauſe al men ſhold giue themſelues to me. Thou knoweſt wel <hi>Fuluius,</hi> that I haue bene a Conſul as thou art, and thou haſt not bene an Emperour as I am. Therfore beleue me in thys caſe, that the prince being diſpiſed, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of hys people. The gods wil not, nor the lawes do permyte, neyther the common wealth wyllyngly ſhould ſuffer, that al princes ſhould be lordes of many, and that they ſhould not communicate but with a few. For princes
<pb facs="tcp:21411:78"/>
which haue bene gentile in their lyues, the auncients haue made them gods after their deathes. The fiſher, to fiſh for many fiſhes in the riuer, goeth not with one bote alone, nor the Mariner to fiſh in the depe ſea, goeth with one net only. I meane, that the profounde willes, which are deepely encloſed in the hartes, oughte to be wonne ſome by giftes, other by promiſes, other by pleaſaunt words, and others by gentle enterteynement, For princes ſhould trauaile more to winne the hartes of their ſubiectes, then to conquere the Realmes of ſtraungers. The gredy and couetous hartes care not, thoughe the prince ſhutteth vp his hart, ſo that he open his cofers: but noble and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt men litle eſteme that which they locke vp in their cofers, ſo that their hartes be open to their frendes. For loue can neuer but with loue againe be requited. Sith Princes are lords of many, of neceſſitie they ought to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with many: &amp; being ſerued with many, they are bound to ſatiſfie many: and this is as generally, as perticulerly, they cannot diſpence with their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts. For the prince is no leſſe bound to pay the ſeruice of his ſeruaunte, then the maiſter is to pay the wages of the hired laborer. Therefore if thys thing be true (as it is) how ſhal poore princes do, which kepe many Realmes, &amp; in keping them they haue great expenſes, and for to pay ſuch charges they haue lytle money. For in this caſe, let euery man do what he will, and let them take what counſaile they like beſt, I would counſaile all others, as I my ſelfe haue experimented, that is: that the prince ſhold be of ſo good a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſacion, among thoſe which are his, and ſo affable and familiar with all, that for his good conuerſacion only they ſhould thinke them ſelues wel paid. For with rewardes, princes recompence the trauaile of their ſeruantes: but with gentle wordes, they robbe the hartes of their ſubiectes. We ſe by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that diuers marchauntes had rather by dearer in one ſhoppe, becauſe the marchaunt is pleaſaunte: then to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ye better chepe in an other, wheras the marchaunt is churliſhe. I meane that there are many, which had rather ſerue a prince, to gaine nothing but loue only: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſerue an other prince for money. For there is no ſeruice better imployed, then to him which is honeſt, good, and gracious: and to the contrary none worſe beſtowed, then on hym which is vnthankfull and churlyſhe. In princes pallaces there ſhall neuer want euil and wicked men, malicious &amp; deueliſhe flatterers, which wil ſeke meanes to put into their Lords heades howe they ſhall rayſe their rentes, leauye ſubſidies, inuent tributes, and borow money: but there are none that wil tel them, how they ſhal winne the hartes and good willes of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, though they know it more profitable to be wel beloued, then neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to be enriched. He that heapeth treaſure for his prince, and ſeperateth him from the loue of his people: ought not to be called a faithfull ſeruaunt, but a mortall enemy. Princes and Lordes ought greatly to endeuour themſelues to be ſo conuerſant among their ſubiects, that they had rather ſerue for good wil: then for the payment of money. For if moneye wante, their ſeruice will quaile, and hereof procedeth a thouſand inconueniences vnto princes, which neuer happen vnto thoſe that haue ſeruauntes, whiche ſerue more of good wil then for moneye: for he that loueth with al his harte, is not proude in proſperitie, deſperate in aduerſitie, neither complayneth he of pouertie, nor is diſcontented being fauourleſſe, nor yet abaſhed with perſecution, &amp; finallye
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:21411:78"/>
loue and life are neuer ſeperated, vntill they come vnto the graue. We ſee by experience, that the rableme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the poore labourers of <hi>Scicil</hi> is more worth, then the money of the knightes of Rome. For the labourer euery time he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the fielde, bringeth ſome profit from thence: but euery time the knight ſheweth him ſelfe in the market place, he returneth without money. By that compariſon I meane, that princes ſhould be affable, eaſie to talke with all, pleaſaunt, mercifull, benigne, and ſtoute, and aboue all that they be gracious and louing, to the end that through theſe qualities, and not by money, they may learne to wynne the hartes of their ſubiectes. Princes ſhould greately labour to be loued, ſpecially if they will finde who ſhall ſuccour them in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie, and kepe them from euill will and hatred, whiche thoſe princes can not haue that are hated: but rather euery man reioyceth at their fall and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie. For eche man enioyeth his own trauaile, and truly the furious and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull hartes taketh ſome reſte, to ſee that others haue pitie and compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon their griefes. Princes alſo ſhould endeuour them ſelues to be loued &amp; well willed, becauſe at their death they maye of all their ſeruauntes and frendes be lamented. For princes ought to be ſuche, that they may be prayed for in their life, and lamented and remembred after their death. Howe curſed is that prince, and alſo howe vnhappy is that common wealth, where the ſeruauntes wyll not ſerue their Lorde but for rewarde: and that the Lorde doth not loue them but for ther ſeruices. For there is neuer true loue, where there is any particuler intereſte. With many ſtones a houſe is buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and of many men and one prince (whiche is the head of all) the common wealth is made. For he that gouerneth the common wealth, may be called a prince, and otherwyſe not: and the common wealth can not be called nor ſayde a common wealth, if it hath not a prince whiche is the head thereof. If Geometrie doe not deceiue me, the lyme whiche ioyneth one ſtone with an other, ſuffereth well that it be myngled with ſande, but the corner ſtone that lyeth on the toppe ought to be medled with vnſlekyd lyme. And it ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto good reaſon. For if the nether ſtones ſeperate, the wall openeth: but if the corner ſhould ſlippe, the buylding incontinently falleth. I ſuppoſe (fathers conſcript) you vnderſtande very well to what ende I applie this compariſon. The loue of one neighbour with an other, may ſuffer to be cold: but the loue of a prince to his people, ſhould be true and pure. I meane that the loue amongeſt frendes may well paſſe ſometymes though it be colde: but the loue betwene the kyng and his people, at all tymes oughte to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For where there is parfite loue, there is no fained wordes, nor vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>I haue ſeene in Rome many debates among the people to haue bene pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in one day: and one onely which betwene the Lord and the common wealth aryſeth, can not be pacified vntyll death. For it is a daungerous thing for one to ſtryue with many, and for many to contende againſt one. In this caſe, where the one is proude, and the other rebelles, I wyll not excuſe the prince, nor let to condemne the people. For in the end he that thinketh himſelf moſte innocent, deſerueth greateſt blame. From whence thinke you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth it, that Lordes nowe a daies doe commaunde vniuſt thinges by fury, &amp; that ſubiectes in iuſte matters wyll not obey by reaſon. I will tell you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:79"/>The Lorde doing of will, and not of right, would caſte the willes of all in his owne braine, and deriue from him ſelfe all counſayle. For euen as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are of greater power then all the reſte: ſo they thinke they knowe more then all the reſte. The contrary happeneth to ſubiectes, who (beinge prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked I can not tel you with what freneſy) deſpiſing the good vnderſtanding of their Lord, will not obey that that their princes willeth, for the health of them all, but that whiche euery man deſireth for him ſelfe particularly. For men nowe a dayes are ſo fonde, that euery man thynketh the prince ſhould loke on him alone. Truely it is a ſtraunge thing (though it be muche vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men) that one ſhould deſire that the garmentes of all other ſhould be mete for him: whiche is as impoſſible, as one mans armour ſhoulde arme a multitude. But what ſhall we be (Fathers conſcripte and ſacred ſenate) ſith our fathers lefte vs this worlde with ſuche foly, and that in theſe debates &amp; ſtryfes, we their children, are alwayes in diſſention and controuerſie, and in this wilfulnes, we ſhall alſo leaue our children and heires. How many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haue I ſeene and read of in my time, of my predeceſſours, whiche were vtterly vndone, by to muche pryde and preſumption: But I neuer read nor heard of any, whiche were deſtroyed for being courteous, and louing to his ſubiectes. I will declare by ſome examples, whiche I haue read in bookes, to the ende that the Lordes may ſee what they wynne by their good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, and what they loaſe by being to haulty. The realme of the <hi>Sydoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> was greater then that of the <hi>Caldeans</hi> in weapons, and inferiour in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, vnto that of the <hi>Aſſirians.</hi> In this realme there was <hi>Debaſtia,</hi> whiche was called a linage of kinges, that endured two hundreth and .xxv. yeares, becauſe all thoſe kinges were of a commendable conuerſation. And an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Debaſtia</hi> endured no longer then fourty yeares. And our auncientes tooke pleaſure of peace, whereof we are deſtitute: and were ignoraunt of the warres, whiche we nowe vſe ſo muche. Alwayes they deſired to haue kinges whiche ſhould be good for the common wealth in peace, rather than valiaunt and couragious for the warre. As <hi>Homere</hi> in his <hi>Iliade</hi> ſaieth: the auncient <hi>Egiptians</hi> called their kinges <hi>Epiphanes,</hi> and had a cuſtome, that <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> alwaies ſhould enter into the temples barefoote. And becauſe it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For truly when Lordes are euil willed, and not beloued, for a litle trifle and occaſion the people will ariſe and rebell againſt them. The ſaide <hi>Homere</hi> ſaide alſo, that the <hi>Parthes</hi> called their kynges <hi>Aſſacides,</hi> &amp; that the ſixte of that name was depriued and expulſed the realme, for that of preſumption he had hym ſelfe to the mariage of a knight, and being bidden and deſired, would not go to the mariage of a poore <hi>Plebeyan. Cicero</hi> in his <hi>Tuſculanes</hi> ſaith, that in olde time the people perſwaded their princes to communicate with the poore, &amp; that they ſhould abſtaine and flye from the ryche. For among the poore they may learne to be mercifull, and with the ryche they ſhall learne nothing but to be proude. Ye knowe right well (Fathers conſcript) howe this our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

was firſt called great Grece, afterwarde it was called <hi>Latium,</hi> and then Italie. And when it was called <hi>Latium,</hi> they called their kynges <hi>Marrani,</hi> and truly though their borders were but narrowe: yet at the leaſte their ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was great. The <hi>Annales</hi> of thoſe times ſay, that after the thirde <hi>Siluius,</hi> ſucceded a <hi>Marrane</hi> who was proude, ambitious, and euill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicioned, in ſuch ſorte, that for feare of the people, alwaies he ſlept locked vp: and therfore they depryued and baniſhed him the Realme. For the auncientes ſaide, that the king ſhould locke his dores at no houre of the nighte againſt his ſubiectes, neither he ſhould refuſe in the daie to geue them audience. <hi>Tarquine</hi> whiche was the laſt of the ſeuen kinges of Rome, was very vnthankefull towards his father in lawe, he was an infamie to his bloud, a traytour to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and cruell of his perſone, who alſo enforced the noble <hi>Lucretia,</hi> and yet notwithſtanding this, they doe not call him vnthankefull, infamous, cruell, traytour, nor adulterer: but <hi>Tarquine</hi> the proude, onely for that he was euill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicioned. By the faith of a good man I ſweare vnto you (Fathers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcript) that if the miſerable <hi>Tarquine</hi> had bene beloued in Rome, he had neuer bene depriued of the Realme, for committing adultery with <hi>Lucretia:</hi> for in the end if euery light offence which in youth is committed, ſhould be puniſhed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhort ſpace there ſhould be no common wealth. All theſe euils (both before and after <hi>Tarquine</hi>) were committed by the auncientes in the Romaine em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, whiche were ſuche as theſe (of this young and lighte prince) and were nothing in compariſon vnto thee. For truly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering the youth of the one, and the experience of the other: the greateſt offence of the younge, is but a counterfaite to the leaſt that the olde committeth. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> laſt dictatour, and firſte Emperour of Rome, (being a thing commendable bothe to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours to ſalute the Emperour on their knees, and to the Emperour to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe againſte them and reſalute eche one according to his order) becauſe of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and that he woulde not obſerue this ceremonie, with .xxiii. woundes they diſpatched him of his life. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was an Emperour, whom they blame for drunkennes, and <hi>Caligula</hi> was an Emperour alſo, whom they accuſe of inceſte with his ſiſters. <hi>Nero</hi> was an Emperour, who (for that he ſlewe his mother, and his maiſter <hi>Seneca</hi>) hath for euer bene named cruell. <hi>Sergius Galba</hi> was a deuouring and gluttonous Emperour, for that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for one onely banket ſeuen thouſand byrdes to be kylled. <hi>Domitian</hi> was an Emperour, who was greatly noted of all euils. For all euils whiche in many were ſcattered, in him alone were founde. All theſe miſerable princes in the ende were betraied, hanged, and beheaded. And I ſweare vnto ye (fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conſcript) that they died not for their vices, but becauſe they were proude, and euill conditioned. For finally the prince for one vice only cannot muche endomage the people: but for being to haulty, and preſumptuous, &amp; of euill conditions, he may deſtroy a common wealth. Let princes and great lordes be aſſured, that if they geue many occaſions of euill will, afterwardes one only ſuffiſeth, to ſtirre their ſubiects to deſtroy them. For if the lord ſhew not his hatred, it is for that he will not: but if the ſubiecte doe not reuenge, it is for that he cannot. Beleue me (fathers conſcripte, and ſacred Senate) that euen as the Phiſitians with a litle triacle purge manye euyll humours of the bodye: ſoo the ſage Prynces wyth verye lyttle beneuolence, drawe
<pb facs="tcp:21411:80"/>
out of their ſubiectes muche fylthines of harte, diuerting their ill willes into true and faithfull loue. And becauſe the members ſhould be agreable with the head, in myne opinion it behoueth the people to obey the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the prince, and to honour and reuerence his perſon: and the good prince to be iuſte and equall to all in generally, and gentle in conuerſation with euery one. O happy common wealth, wherein the prince findeth obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the people, and the people in like maner loue in the prince. For of the loue of the Lorde, ſpringeth obedience in the ſubiecte: and of the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the ſubiectes, ſpringeth loue in the Lorde. The Emperour in Rome, is as the ſpyder in the middeſt of her cobwebbe: the which being touched with the needels pointe by one of the threedes of the ſame (be it neuer ſo litle) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly the ſpider feeleth it. I meane, that all the workes whiche the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour doth in Rome, are immediatly publiſhed through out all the countrey. For in fine, ſince princes are the myrrour of all, they cannot well cloake their vices. I ſee (fathers conſcripte) that I haue bene iudged here of worldly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, becauſe I accompanied the captiues in proceſſion, and alſo becauſe I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fred my ſelfe to be touched with them, to the ende they might enioye the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge of their libertie: and in this caſe I render moſt humble thankes to the immortall gods, becauſe they made me a mercifull Emperour, to ſet thoſe at libertie that were in pryſone: and that they made me not a cruel tyraunt, to ſet thoſe in pryſon whiche were at libertie. For the prouerbe ſaieth, that with one beane, a man may take two pigeons: euen ſo chaunſed the lyke herein yeſterdaie. For the benefite was done for thoſe miſerable captiues: but the example of humanitie was ſhewed to all ſtraunge nations. And knowe ye not, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prince vnloſeth the irons from the feete of the captiues, he byndeth the hartes, landes, and goodes of his ſubiectes? concluding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaye, that to princes it were more ſafetie, and to the common wealthe more profite, to be ſerued in their palaces by free hartes with loue: then by ſubiectes whiche are kept vnder by feare.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>MArcus Aurelius</hi> Emperour of Rome, tribune of the people, high byſhop, ſeconde conſull and monarche of all the Romaine empire, wyſheth to the <hi>Pulio</hi> his olde frende, health to thy perſone, and proſperitie againſte thy euill fortune. The letter that thou wroteſt vnto me from <hi>Capua,</hi> I recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued here at <hi>Bethinia,</hi> and if thou diddeſt wryte it with a good hart, I did read it with willing eyes: whereof thou oughteſt ſomewhat to content thee. For it is an auncient ſaying of <hi>Homere,</hi> that that whiche is well vewed with the eyes, is tenderly beloued of the harte. I proteſt vnto thee by the faithe of the immortall gods, that I doe not wryte vnto thee as a Romaine emperour, that is to ſaye, from the lorde to the ſeruaunt, for in this ſorte I ſhould wryte vnto thee briefe, and touching the purpoſe: which thing ought not to be done to the peculier frende. For the letters of graue men ſhould neuer beginne, &amp; the letters of vs frendes ſhould neuer ende. I wryte vnto thee my frende <hi>Pulio,</hi> as to a priuate frende, to an olde companion of mine, and as to him, whiche is a faithfull ſecretary of my deſyres, and in whoſe company I was neuer diſpleaſed, in whoſe mouth I neuer founde lie, and in whoſe promiſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21411:80"/>
there was neuer breache made. And the thing being thus, I ſhould commit treaſon in the lawe of frendſhip, if I kept ſecret from thee any of my inward conceites. For all the griefes, whiche lie buried in the woful harte, ought not to be communicate but with a faithful frende. Doeſt thou thinke <hi>Pulio,</hi> that the Romaine emperour hath litle trauaile to wryte vnto thee as Emperour, to ſpeake as Emperoure, to walke as Emperoure, and to eate as empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and finally to be as emperour in deede? certes I doe not meruaile hereat. For truly the life of the vertuous emperour, is but a dial which orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth or diſordereth the comon wealth: and that wherof I marueile, is of the foly of Rome, &amp; vanitie of the common wealth. For as much as all ſaye that the prince (if he wil ſeme graue, &amp; be well eſtemed of the people) ought to goe ſoftly, to ſpeake litle, &amp; to write briefly: ſo that for writing of letters they wyll he be brief, &amp; for conquering of ſtraunge realmes they doe not rebuke him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be long. Wiſe men ſhould deſire that their princes be of a gentle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dition, to the end they fal not to tyranny. That they haue their mind vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, to miniſter to all equall iuſtice, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their thought be good, not to deſire ſtraunge realmes, that they haue their hartes voide frome wrathe, that they be ſound within to pardon iniuries, that they loue their ſubiectes to be ſerued of them, that thei know the good to honour them, &amp; that they know the euil to puniſh them: &amp; as for the ſurplus, we litle regard whether the king go faſt, whether he eate much, or write brief. For the daunger is not in that which is in the lack of his perſon: but is in the negligence that he vſeth in the common wealth. I haue receiued my frend <hi>Pulio</hi> great comfort of thy letter, but much more I ſhould haue receiued of thy preſence: for the letters of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient frendes, are but as a reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce of time paſt. It is a great pleaſure to the mariner, to talke of the perils paſt being in the hauen: &amp; to the captaine, to glorie of the battaile after the victory. I meane aboue al pleaſure this is the greateſt to men, being now faithful frendes, to talke of the trauaile and dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which they paſſed, when they were young me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Beleue me in one thing, and doe not doubt therof. There is no man that knoweth to ſpeake, that knoweth to poſſeſſe, nor that can iudge or take any pleaſure, neither that knoweth well how to kepe the goods which the gods haue geuen him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be he that hath bought it derely with great trauaile. For with al our hartes we loue that thing, which by our own proper trauaile we haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. I aſke thee one thing: who is he that oweth moſt to the gods, or that is moſt eſtemed amongeſt men? of <hi>Traian</hi> the iuſte, whiche was brought vp in the warres of <hi>Dace,</hi> Germany and Spaine? or of <hi>Nero</hi> the cruell, whiche was nouriſhed in all the deliciouſnes of Rome. Truly the one was none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then a Roſe among briers, and the other was but a nettel among flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. I ſpeake this, becauſe the good <hi>Traian</hi> hath gouerned his life in ſuch ſort, that alwayes they will ſmell the roſe by the pleaſaunt ſauour: but the cruell <hi>Nero</hi> hath left the ſting with the nettell of his infamy. I will not ſpeake all, becauſe many are &amp; were made good, but for the moſt part the princes which were brought vp deliciouſly, gaue euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſion that al ſhould be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for the euil gouernaunce of their liues in their realmes: and becauſe they neuer experimented any kinde of trauaile in them ſelues, they do litle eſteme the paines of another. I wil not that thou thinke my frend <hi>Pulio,</hi> that I haue forgotten the time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is paſt, though the gods brought me to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> empire preſent.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:81"/>
For though we togethers were toſſed with the tormentes of youthe: yet nowe we maye repoſe our ſelues in the caulmes of our age. I doe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou and I did ſtudy in <hi>Rhodes</hi> in letters, and after we had ſo wen weapons in <hi>Capua,</hi> it hath pleaſed the Gods that the ſeedes of my fortune ſhould rype here in Rome, and to thee and to others better then I, fortune would not geue one onely eare. I doe not geue the licence that thy thought be ſuſpitious of me, ſithe thou of my harte arte made a faithfull frende: for if vnconſtant fortune doth truſte me, to gather with trauayle the grape, know thou that here in my palace thou ſhalt not want of the wyne. The gods will not ſuffer, that nowe in this moment thou ſhouldeſt finde my harte ſhutte from thee, whoſe gates I founde alwayes (for the ſpace of twenty yeares) open vnto me. Sithe that my fortunes brought me to the Empire, I haue alwayes had two thinges before myne eyes: that is to wete, not to reuenge my ſelfe of myne enemies, neither to be vnthankefull to my frendes. For I praye to the gods daily, rather then hereafter through vnthankefulnes my renowme ſhould be defamed: that euen nowe with forgetfulnes my bodye ſhould be buried. Let a man offer to the Gods what ſacrifices he will, let him doe as muche ſeruice to men as he can: yet if he be vnthankefull to his frende, he oughte in all and for all to be vtterly condemned. Becauſe thou ſhouldeſt ſee my frende <hi>Pulio,</hi> how greatly the auncient frende ought to bee eſtemed, I will declare thee an example of a Philoſopher, the which to heare thou wilt ſomewhat reioyce. The auncient hiſtories of the Grecians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that among the ſeuen ſages of Grece, there was one named <hi>Periander,</hi> who was prince and gouernour a greate whyle: and he had in hym ſuche li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelines of ſpirite on the one ſide, and ſuche couetouſnes of worldly goods on the other ſide: that the hiſtoriographers are in doubte whether was the greater, the philoſophie that he taught reading in the ſcholes: or the tyranny that he vſed in robbing in the common wealth. For truly the ſcience whiche is not grounded of trougthe, bringeth great domages to the perſon. In the ſeconde yeare of my empire I was in the citie of <hi>Corinthe,</hi> where I ſawe the graue whiche conteined the bones of <hi>Periander:</hi> where about was ingrauen in Greke verſes and olde letter this Epitaphe.</p>

That this <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was a tyraunt not only in dede, but alſo in renowme: ſo that thei ſpake of no other thing thorowe Greece, but it tended hereunto. Though he had euill workes, he had good wordes, &amp; procured y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the affaires of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth ſhuld be wel redreſſed.

I ſpeake this, becauſe <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> in his firſt fiue yeares was the beſt of all, and the other nyne folowyng he was the worſte of all: ſo that there is bothe cauſe to diſprayſe him, and alſo cauſe to commende him. When a vertuous man will ſpeake of princes that are dead, before princes whiche are aliue, he is bounde to prayſe onely one of their vertues which they had, &amp; hath no licence to reuyle the vices whereof thei were noted. For the good deſerueth rewarde, becauſe he endeuoreth him ſelfe to folowe vertue: &amp; the euill likewyſe deſerueth pardon, becauſe through frayltie he hath conſented to vyce. All theſe wordes the emperoure <hi>Traian</hi> ſpake I being preſent, and they were ſpoken with ſuche fiercenes, that all thoſe whiche were there preſent bothe chaunged their colour, and alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained their tongues. For truly the ſhameleſſe man feeleth not ſo muche a great ſtrype of correction, as the gentill harte doth a ſharpe worde of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition. I was willing to ſhewe thee theſe thinges, my frende <hi>Pulio,</hi> becauſe that ſince <hi>Traian</hi> ſpake for <hi>Nero,</hi> and that he founde in hym ſome prayſe, I doe thynke no leſſe of the tyraunte <hi>Periander,</hi> whome thoughe for his euyll workes he dyd we doe condemne: yet for his good wordes that he ſpake, for the good lawes whiche he made, we doe prayſe. For in the man that is euill, there is nothing more eaſier then to geue good counſayle, and there is nothing more harder then to worke well. <hi>Periander</hi> made dyuerſe lawes for the common wealth of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> whereof here folowing, I wil declare ſome. We ordeyne and commaunde that if any by multipliyng of wordes kyll an other (ſo that it were not by treaſon) that he be not therefore condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to die, but that they make hym ſlaue perpetuall to the brother of him that is ſlayne, or to the nexte of his kynne or frends: for a ſhorte deathe is &amp; leſſe payne, then a longe ſeruitude. We ordeyne and commaunde, that if any theſe be taken he ſhall not dye, but with a hotte iron ſhalbe marked on the forehead to be knowen for a thefe: for to ſhammefaſte men longe infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime is more payne, then a ſhort lyfe. We ordeyne and commaunde, that the man or woman whiche to the preiudice of an other ſhall tell any lye, ſhall for the ſpace of a moneth carie a ſtone in their mouthe: for it is not meete that he whiche is wonte to lye, ſhould alwayes bee authoryſed to ſpeake.</p>
                     <p>We ordeyne and commaunde that euery man or woman, that is a quareler and ſedicious perſone in the common wealth, be with great reproche ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed frome the people: for it is vnpoſſible that he ſhoulde bee in fauoure with the Gods, which is an enemie to his neighbours. We ordeyne and commaunde that if there be any in the common wealth, that haue receiued of an other a benefite, and that afterwardes it is proued he was vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that in ſuche caſe they put hym to death: for the man that of benefites receiued is vnthankefull, oughte not to lyue in the worlde amonge menne. Beholde therefore my frende <hi>Pulio,</hi> the antiquitie whiche I declared vnto thee, and howe mercifull the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were to murtherers, theues, and Pirates: And contrarie howe ſeuere they were to vnthankefull people, whome they commaunded forthwith to be putte to deathe.</p>
                     <p>And truly in myne opinion the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had reaſon, for there is nothinge troubleth a wyſe man more, then to ſee him vnthankefull to him whome he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21411:82"/>
hath ſhewed pleaſure vnto. I was willing to tel thee this hiſtorie of <hi>Perian<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der,</hi> for no other cauſe, but to the end thou ſhouldeſt ſee and know, that foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as I doe greatly blame the vice of vnthankefulnes, I will laboure not to be noted of the ſame. For he that reproueth vice, is not noted to be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: but he which vtterly flieth it. Count vpon this my worde that I tel thee which thou ſhalt not thinke to be fained, that though I be the Romain Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, I wilbe thy faithfull frend, &amp; wil not faile to be thankefull towardes thee. For I eſteme it no leſſe glory to know how to keape a frend by wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: then to come to the eſtate of an emperour by philoſophie. By the letter thou ſenteſt, thou requiredſt me of one thing to anſwere thee, for the whiche I am at my wittes end. For I had rather open my treaſures to thy neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, then to open the bookes to anſwere to thy demaundes, although it be to my coſt. I confeſſe thy requeſt to be reaſonable, and thou deſerueſt worthy prayſe: for in the end it is more worth to knowe, how to procure a ſecrete of antiquities paſt, then to heape vp treaſures for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neceſſities in time to come. As the philoſopher maketh philoſophie his treaſour of knowledge to liue in peace, &amp; to hope &amp; to loke for death with honour: ſo the couetous (being ſuche a one as he is) maketh his treaſure of worldly goodes, for to keape &amp; preſerue life in this world in perpetuall warres, and to end his life and take his death with infamie. Herein I ſweare vnto thee, that one daie emploied in philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy is more worth, then ten thouſand which are ſpent in heaping riches. For the life of a peaceable man is none other, then a ſwete peregrination: and the life of ſedicious perſones is none other, but a long death. Thou requireſt me my frend <hi>Pulio,</hi> that I write vnto thee wherin the auncientes in times paſt had their felicitie: knowe thou that their deſires were ſo diuerſe, that ſome diſpraiſed life, others deſired it: ſome prolonged it, others did ſhorten it: ſome did not deſire pleaſures but trauailes, others in trauailes did not ſeke but pleaſures: the whiche varietie did not proceade but of diuerſe endes, for the taſtes were diuerſe, and ſondry men deſired to taſte diuerſe meates. By the immortall Gods I ſweare vnto thee, that this thy requeſt maketh me muſe of thy life, to ſee that my phyloſophie anſwereth thee not ſufficiently therein. For if thou aſke to proue me, thou thinkeſt me preſumptuous: if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde in mirth, thou counteſt me to be to light: if thou demaundeſt it not in good earneſt, thou takeſt me for ſimple: if thou demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deſt me for to ſhew it thee, be thou aſſured I am ready to learne it: if thou demaundeſt it for to knowe it, I confeſſe I can not teache it thee: if thou demaundeſt it becauſe thou maieſt be aſked it, be thou aſſured that none wylbe ſatiſfied with my aunſwere: and if perchaunce thou doeſt aſke it, becauſe thou ſleapinge haſte dreamed it, ſeing that nowe thou art awake, thou oughteſt not to beleue a dreame. For all that the fantaſie in the nighte doth imagine, the tongue doth publiſhe it in the morning. O my frende <hi>Pulio</hi> I haue reaſon to complayne of thee, for ſo muche as thou doeſt not regarde the authoritie of my perſone, nor the credite of thy phyloſophie, wherefore I feare leaſte they wyll iudge thee to curious in demaundinge, and me to ſimple in aunſweringe: all this notwithſtanding, I determine to aunſwere thee, not as I ought, but as I can, not according to the greate thou demaundeſt, but according to the litle I knowe. And partely I doe it to accomplyſhe thy requeſte, and alſo to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyll
<pb facs="tcp:21411:83"/>
my deſire. And nowe I thinke that all whiche ſhall reade this letter, wyll be cruell iudges of my ignoraunce.</p>

                        <p>IN the Olimpiade, the hundreth and thre, <hi>Serges</hi> being king of <hi>Perſes,</hi> and the cruel tyraunt <hi>Lyſander</hi> captaine of the <hi>Peloponenſes,</hi> a famous battayle was fought betwene the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Lyſander,</hi> vpon the great ryuer of <hi>Aegcon</hi> whereof <hi>Lyſander</hi> had the victory: and truly vnles the hiſtories deceiue vs, the <hi>Athenians</hi> tooke this conflicte greuouſly, becauſe the battayle was loſte more through negligence of their captaines, then through the great nombre of their enemies. For truly many winne victories more through the coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe that ſome haue, than for the hardineſſe that others haue. The philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher <hi>Epicurus</hi> at that tyme floriſhed, who was of a liuely wytte, but of a meane ſtature, and had memorie freſh, being meanely learned in philoſophie, but he was of much eloquence, and for to encourage and counſell the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> he was ſent to the warres. For whan the auncientes tooke vpon them any warres, they choſe firſt ſages to geue counſaile, then captaines to leade the ſouldiours. And amongeſt the priſoners, the philoſopher <hi>Epicurus</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to whom the tyraunt <hi>Lyſander</hi> gaue good entertainement, and honoured him aboue all other: and after he was taken he neuer went from him, but redde philoſophie vnto him, and declared vnto him hiſtories of times paſte, and of the ſtrengthe and vertues of many Greekes and Troyans. The ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt <hi>Lyſander</hi> reioyſed greatly at theſe thinges. For truly tyrauntes take great pleaſure to heare the proweſſe &amp; vertues of auncientes paſt, &amp; to folow the wickednes &amp; vices of them that are preſent. <hi>Lyſander</hi> therefore taking the triumphe, &amp; hauing a nauy by ſea, &amp; a great army by land, vpon the ryuer of <hi>Aegeon,</hi> he and his captaines forgotte the daunger of the warres, &amp; gaue the brydel to the ſlouthfull fleſh, ſo that to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great preiudice of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth they led a diſſolute and ydle life. For the maner of tyrannous princes is, to leaue of their owne trauaile, &amp; to enioy that of other mens. The philoſopher <hi>Epicurus</hi> was alwaies brought vp in the excellent vniuerſitie of <hi>Athens,</hi> wher as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> philoſophers liued in ſo great pouertie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> naked they ſlept on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, their drinke was colde water, none amongeſt them had any houſe propre, they deſpiſed riches as peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; labored to make peace where diſcord was, they were only defenders of the common wealth, they neuer ſpake any idle worde, &amp; it was a ſacrilege amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to heare a lie: &amp; finally it was a lawe inuiolable amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the philoſopher that ſhuld be idle ſhuld be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, &amp; he that was vicious ſhuld be put to death. The wicked <hi>Epicurus</hi> forget<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting the doctrine of his maiſters, &amp; not eſteming grauitie (wherunto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſages are bound) gaue him ſelf wholy both in words &amp; deedes vnto a voluptuous &amp; beaſtly kinde of life, wherin he put his whole felicitie. For he ſaid ther was no other felicitie for ſlouthful men, then to ſleape in ſoft beds: for delicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to fele neither heat nor cold: for fleſhly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to haue at their pleaſur amo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rous dames: for dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kardes, not to wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t any pleaſaunt wines: &amp; gluttons, to haue their filles of all delicate meates: for herein he affirmed to conſiſte all worldly felicitie. I doe not marueile at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude of his ſcholers which he had, hath, &amp; ſhal haue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. For at this day ther are few in Rome, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to be maiſtred w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vices: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude of thoſe which liue at

their owne willes, and ſenſualitie, are infinite. And to fell the truthe, my frend <hi>Pulio,</hi> I doe not marueile that there hath bene vertuous, neither I do muſe that there hath bene vicious: for the vertuous hopeth to reſte him ſelfe with the gods in an other worlde, by his well doing: and if the vicious be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, I doe not marueile though he will goe and ingage him ſelfe to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this world, ſince he doth not hope neither to haue pleaſure in this, nor yet to enioy reſt with the gods in the other.

They ſaye that though this philoſopher was of a rude knowledge, yet otherwyſe he had a very good natural wytte, and was very diligent in harde thinges, and very paciente with thoſe that dyd hym wrong, he was exceading cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious in aduerſities, and moderate in proſperities. And the thyng that I moſte delighted in hym was, that he was curteous and gentyll in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, and bothe pithie and eloquente in his communication. For that man onely is happie, where all men prayſe his lyfe, and no man reproueth his tongue. The auncient Greekes declare in their hiſtories, that this phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> was the firſt that inuented Tragedies, and that gotte mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to repreſente them: and ſythe the inuention was newe and pleaſaunt, many dyd not onely folowe hym, but they gaue hym muche of their goods. And marueyle not thereat my frende <hi>Pulio,</hi> for the lightnes of the common people is ſuche, that to ſee vayne thinges all wyll ronne: and to heare the excellencie of vertues, there is not one that wyll goe. After this phyloſopher <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> had wrytten many bookes ſpecially of tragedies, and that he had afterwarde trauayled through many countreys and realmes, at the laſt he ended the reſidue of his lyfe, nere the Iles whiche are adioyning to the lake of <hi>Meatis.</hi> For as the deuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſaieth, when the auncient philoſophers were younge they ſtudied, when they came to be men they traueyled, and then when they were olde they retyred home. In myne opinion this phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher was wyſe to doe as he did, and no leſſe ſhall men nowe a dayes be that wyll imitate hym. For the fathers of wyſedome, are ſcience and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: and in this conſiſteth true knowledge, when the man at the laſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth home from the troubles of the worlde. Tell me my frende <hi>Pulio</hi> I praye thee, what doth it profite hym that hath learned much, that hath heard muche, that hath knowen much, that hath ſeene muche, that hath bene farre, that hath bought much, that hath ſuffred much, that hath proued much, that had much, if after great trauaile he doth not retire to repoſe him ſelfe a litle: truly he can not be counted wyſe but a foole, that willingly offreth him ſelfe to trauaile, and hath not the witte to procure him ſelfe reſte. For in myne opinion, the lyfe withoute reſte, is a longe death. By chaunce as this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

This phyloſopher <hi>Aeſchylus</hi> was demaunded in his life tyme, wherin the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie of this life conſiſted? whereunto he aunſwered: that in his opinion it conſiſted in ſteaping, and his reaſon was this: that when we ſleape, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſementes of the fleſhe doe not prouoke vs, nor the enemy perſecute vs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the frendes doe importune vs, nor the colde wynter oppreſſe vs, nor the heate of the longe Sommer doth annoye vs, ne yet we are not angry for any thing we ſee, nor we take any care for any thing we heare. Finally when we ſleape, we fele not the anguiſhes of the body, neyther ſuffer the paſſion of the mynd to come. To this end ye muſt vnderſtande that when they were troubled, he gaue them drinkes which cauſed them immediatly to ſleape, ſo that ſo ſone as the man did drinke it, ſo ſone he was a ſlepe.

They write of this philoſopher, that in philoſophy he excelled al thoſe of his time, and alſo in touching, ſinging, and plaiyng of muſike, he was more excellent then any of all his predeceſſours: for the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banes</hi> affirmed, that there was neuer any ſene of ſuche aptenes in ſpeaking, &amp; ſo excellent deliuering of his fingers in playing, as <hi>Pindarus</hi> was: and more ouer he was a great moral philoſopher, but not ſo excellent in naturall philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie.

For they know litle, and ſpeake much: and worſt of all in their wordes they are cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, and in their deedes very negligent. The deuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his booke that he made of lawes, mencioneth this philoſopher, &amp; <hi>Iunius Ruſticus</hi> in his <hi>Thebaide</hi> ſhewed one thing of him, and that is, that an Embaſſadour of <hi>Lides</hi> being in <hi>Thebes,</hi> ſeing <hi>Pindarus</hi> to be of a vertuous life, &amp; very diſagreable in his wordes, he ſpake vnto him ſuch wordes.

This vyctorie of <hi>Zeno</hi> was ſo greatlye to the contentacion of his perſon, that he ſpake with his tongue, and wrote with hys penne, that ther was none other felycitye, then to know how to haue the ſtrength of the armes to caſt downe others at his feete. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this philoſopher was, that he ſaid it was a greater kinde of victory to ouerthrowe one to the earth: then to ouercome many in the warres. For in the warres one onlye wrongefullye taketh the vyctorye, ſince there be
<pb facs="tcp:21411:85"/>
many that do winne it: but in wreſtling, as the victorie is to one alone, ſo let the only vyctorye and glory remaine to him, and therfore in this thinge felicitie conſiſteth: for what can be more, then the contentacion of the hart. Truly we cal him in this world happie, that hath his hart content, and hys body in health.</p>

                        <p>WHen the king <hi>Heritaces</hi> reigned among the <hi>Meedes,</hi> and that <hi>Tarquin Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> reigned in Rome, ther was in the coaſtes of <hi>Scithia</hi> a philoſopher cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> who was borne in the citie of <hi>Epimenides. Cecero</hi> greatly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the doctrine of this philoſopher and that he can not tell whiche of theſe two thinges were greater in him, that is to wete the profoundnes of knowledge that the gods had giuen him, or the cruel malyce wherwith he perſecuted his enemyes. For truly as <hi>Pithagoras</hi> ſaith. Thoſe which of men are moſt euyl wylled, of the gods are beſt beloued. This phyloſopher <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charſis</hi> then being as he was of <hi>Scithia</hi> (whych nacion amongeſte the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines was eſtemed Barbarous) it chaunſed, that a malycious Romaine ſought to diſpleaſe the Phyloſopher in wordes, and trulye he was moued thereunto, more throughe malyce then through ſimplicite. For the outward malycious words are a manifeſt token of the inward enuious harte. This Romaine therefore ſayde to the philoſopher it is vnpoſſible <hi>Anacharſis</hi> that thou ſhouldeſt be a <hi>Sithian</hi> borne: for a man of ſuch eloquence cannot be of ſuch a barbarous nation, to whom <hi>Anacharſis</hi> aunſwered. Thou haſt ſayde well, and herein I aſſent to thy wordes, howbeit I do not alow thy inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion: for as by reaſon thou mayſt diſpraiſe me to be of a barbarous countrey, and commend me for my good lyfe. ſo I iuſtly may accuſe the of a wicked lyfe and prayſe the of a good countrey. And herein be thou iudge of both, which of vs two ſhal haue the moſt praiſe in the world to come, eyther thou that art borne a Romaine, and leadeſt a barbarous lyfe: or I that am borne a <hi>Sithian</hi> and leade the lyfe of a Romaine. For in the ende, in the Garden of this lyfe I had rather be a grene apple tree and beare fruite: then to be a drie Libane drawen on the ground, After that <hi>Anacharſis</hi> had bene in Rome long time, and in Greece he determined for the loue of his countrey (nowe being aged) to retourne home to <hi>Scithia,</hi> wherof a brother of his named <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> was kyng, who had the name of a kyng, but in dede he was a Tiraunt. Since this good phyloſopher ſawe hys brother exerciſe the workes of a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunte, &amp; ſeing alſo the people ſo diſſolute, he determined to gyue hys brother the beſt counſayle he could, to ordeyne lawes to the people, &amp; in good order to gouerne them: whych thing being ſene of the Barbarous, by the conſent of them al, as a man who inuented new deuyſes to lyue in the world, before them all openly was put to death. For I wyl thou know my frende <hi>Pulio,</hi> that there is no greater token, that the common wealth is full of vyce: then when they kyll or banyſh thoſe whych are vertuous therin. So therfore as they ledde thys phyloſopher to death, he ſayd he was vnwillyng to take his death, and loth to loſe his life. Wherfore one ſayd vnto him theſe words.

wanteth: the ſage ought to deſire to liue with other ſages, wherof the world is deſtitute: and the old man ought litle to eſteme the loſſe of his life, ſince by true experience he knoweth in what trauayles he hath paſſed his dayes. For truly it is a kind of foly for a man which hath trauayled and fyniſhed a daungerous and long iourney, to lament to ſe himſelfe now in the end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>Anacharſis</hi> aunſwered him. Thou ſpeakeſt very good words my frend, &amp; I would that thy life were as thy counſell is: but it greueth me that in this conflict I haue neither vnderſtanding, nor yet ſence to taſt, nor that I haue time enoughe to thanke the. For I let the know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther is no tongue can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the griefe which a man feeleth, when he ought forthwith to dye. I die, and as thou ſeeſt they kil me only for that I am vertuous. I feele nothing that tormenteth my hart ſo much, as king <hi>Cadinus</hi> my brother doth, for that I can not be reuenged. For in myne opinion, the chiefe felycitie of man con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſteth, in knowing and being able to reuenge the iniurye done without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, before a man doth end his lyfe. It is a commendable thing that the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher pardon iniuries (as the vertuous philoſophers haue accuſtomed to do) but it ſhould be alſo iuſt, that the iniuries which we forgiue, the gods ſhould therwith be charged to ſe reuengment. For it is a hard thing, to ſe a tiraunt put a vertuous man to death, and neuer to ſe the tiraunte to come to the lyke. Me thinketh my frend <hi>Pulio,</hi> that this philoſopher put all his felycytie in reuenging an iniurye, during the like in this world.</p>

                     <p>IN the time that <hi>Ioſue</hi> triumphed amongeſt the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> and that <hi>Dardanus</hi> paſſed from great <hi>Grece</hi> to <hi>Samotratia,</hi> and when the ſonnes of <hi>Agenor</hi> were ſeking their ſiſter <hi>Europe,</hi> and in the time that <hi>Siculus</hi> reigned in <hi>Scicil,</hi> in great <hi>Aſia,</hi> in the Realme of <hi>Egipt,</hi> was buylded a great cytie called <hi>Thebes,</hi> the which king <hi>Buſiris</hi> built, of whom <hi>Diodorus Sicculus,</hi> at large mencioneth. <hi>Plynie</hi> in the .36. chapter of his naturall hiſtorie, and <hi>Homere</hi> in the ſecond of his <hi>Iliade,</hi> and <hi>Statius</hi> in al the booke of his <hi>Thebiade,</hi> do declare great meruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of this citye of <hi>Thebes,</hi> which thing ought greatly to be eſtemed: for a man oughte not to thinke that fayned whiche ſo excellente auctours haue writen. For a truth they ſay that <hi>Thebes</hi> was in circuite .40. myles, and that the walles were .30. ſtades hye, and in breadthe .6. They ſay alſo that the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie had a hundreth gates very ſumptuous and ſtrong, and in euery gate .ii. hundreth horſemen watched. Through the middeſt of <hi>Thebes</hi> paſſed a great riuer, the which by mylles and fiſhe dyd greatly profite the citie. When <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes</hi> was in his proſperity, they ſay that there were two hundreth thouſand fiers, and beſydes all this al the kynges of <hi>Egipt</hi> were buried in that place. As <hi>Strabo</hi> ſayth <hi>De ſitu orbis,</hi> when <hi>Thebes</hi> was deſtroyed with enemies, they found therin lxxvii. tombes of kings whych had bene buried there. And here is to be noted, that al thoſe tombes were of vertuous kings. For among the <hi>Egiptians</hi> it was a law inuiolable, that the king which had bene wicked in his lyfe, ſhould not be buried after his death. Before the noble and worthy <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantia</hi> was founded in <hi>Europe,</hi> the riche <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Affricke,</hi> and the hardye Rome in <hi>Italy,</hi> the goodly <hi>Capua</hi> in <hi>Campaigne</hi> and the great <hi>Argentine</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> and the holy <hi>Helia</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine: Thebes</hi> onlye was the moſt renowmed of all the world. For the <hi>Thebanes</hi> amongeſt al nacions were renowmed, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel for their riches as for their buyldings and alſo becauſe in theyr lawes &amp; cuſtomes, they had many notable &amp; ſeuere things &amp; al the men were ſeuere in their workes, although they would not be knowen by their extreame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges. <hi>Homere</hi> ſayth that the <hi>Thebanes</hi> had v. cuſtomes, wherein they were more extreme then any other nacion.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt was, that the children drawing to v. yeres of age, were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the forehead with a hoote yron, becauſe in what places ſo euer they came they ſhould be knowen for <hi>Thebanes</hi> by that marke.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond was, that they ſhould accuſtome their children to trauaile alwayes on foote. And the occaſion why they dyd this was, becauſe the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians kept their beaſtes for their gods: and therfore when ſo euer they trauayled they neuer rydde on horſebacke, becauſe they ſhould not ſeme to ſitte vpon their god.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third was, that none of the citizens of <hi>Thebes</hi> ſhold mary with any
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21411:88"/>
of ſtraunge nacions, but rather they cauſed them to marrye parentes with parentes, becauſe that frendes maryeng with frendes, they thoughte the frendſhippe and loue ſhould be more ſure.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourthe cuſtome was, that no <hi>Thebane</hi> ſhould in any wiſe make a houſe for himſelfe to dwel in, but firſt he ſhould make his graue wherin he ſhould be buryed. Me thinketh that in this point the <hi>Thebanes</hi> were not to extreme, nor exceſſiue, but that they did lyke ſage and wiſe men: yea and by the law of veryte I ſweare, that they were ſager then we are. For if at the leaſt we dyd imploye our thought but two howers in the weke to make our graue: it is vnpoſſible but that we ſhould correcte euerye daye our life.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The fift cuſtome was, that all the boies which were excedinge faire in their face, ſhoulde be by theym ſtrangled in the cradell: and all the girles whiche were extreame foule, were by them killed &amp; ſacrifiſed to the godds. Sayeng that the gods forgotte themſelues, when they made the men faire, and the women foule. For the man which is very faire, is but an vnparfite woman: and the woman which is extreme foule, is but a ſauage and wilde beaſt. The greateſt God of the <hi>Thebaines</hi> was <hi>Iſis,</hi> who was a red bull nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſhed in the riuer of <hi>Nile,</hi> and they had a cuſtome, that all thoſe which had red heere immediately ſhould be ſacrify<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed. The contrarye they did to the beaſtes, for ſithe their God was a bul of tawnye couloure, none durſt be ſo bold to kyl any beaſts of the ſame coloure. In ſuch fourme and maner, that it was lawfull to kyll both men and women, and not the brute beaſtes. I do not ſay this was wel done of the <hi>Thebaines</hi> to ſley their children, nor yet I do ſay that it was wel done to ſacrifice men &amp; women, which had red or taunye heere, nor I thinke it a thinge reaſonable, that they ſhould do reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the beaſtes of that coloure: but I wonder why they ſhould ſo much diſpiſe foule women, and faire men, ſith all the world is peopled bothe with faire and foule. Then ſith thoſe barbarous (lyuyng as they did vnder a falſe law) did put him to death, whom the Gods had adorned with any beautie? we then which are Chriſtians by reaſon ought much leſſe to eſteme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the body: knowing that moſt commonly thervpon enſueth the vnclen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the ſoule. Vnder the chriſtall ſtone lyeth oftentimes a daungerous worme, in the faier wal is nouriſſhed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> venemous <hi>Coluber,</hi> within the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell of the white tothe is ingendered great paine to the gummes, in the fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt clothe the motes do moſt hurt, and the moſt fruitful tree by wormes is ſoneſt periſſhed. I meane, that vnder the cleane bodyes &amp; faire countenaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are hid many and abhominable vyces. Truly not only to children which are not wiſe, but to all other which are lyght and fraile, beauty is nothing els but the mother of many vyces, and the hinderer of all vertues. Let prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and great Lords beleue me, which thinke, to be faire and wel diſpoſed, that where there is great aboundaunce of corporal goods and graces, there ought to be great bones of vertues to be able to beare them. For the moſte highe trees by great windes are ſhaken. I ſay, that it is vanytie to be vaine glorious, in any thinge of this world, be it neuer ſo parfite: and alſo I ſaye that it is a greate vanytie to be proude, of the corporall beautye. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge all the acceptable giftes that nature gaue to the mortalles, there is nothinge more ſuperfluous in man, and leſſe neceſſarie, then the beautye
<pb facs="tcp:21411:89"/>
of the body. For truly whether we be faire or foule, we are nothing the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beloued of God, neyther thereby the more hated of men. O blyndnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, O lyfe which neuer lyueth nor ſhal lyue, O death which neuer hath end, I know not why man through the accident of this beautye ſhoulde or durſt take vpon him any vaine glory or preſumption: ſith he knoweth that all the faireſt, and moſt parfiteſt of fleſh, muſt be ſacrificed to the wormes in the graue. And knowe alſo, that all the propernes of the members ſhalbe forfeited to the hongry wormes which are in the earth. Let the great, ſcorne the lytle aſmuch as they will, the faire, mocke the foule at their pleaſure, the hole, diſdaine the ſicke, the wel made, enuy the deformed, the white, hate the blacke, and the Giantes, dyſpiſe the dwarfes: yet in the end al ſhall haue an end. Truly in myne opinion, the trees beare not the more fruit, for that they are ſtreight only, nor for being high, neither for geuing great ſhadowe, nor for being beautifull, nor yet for being great. By this compariſon I meane, that though a noble &amp; ſtout man be proper of parſon, and noble of linage, ſhadowing of fauour, comlye in countenaunce, in renowne very high, and in the common wealth puiſſaunt, that therfore he is not the better in lyfe.</p>
                     <p>For truly the common wealthes are not altered by the ſimple labourers which trauaile in the fieldes: but by the vicyous men, which take great eaſe in their liues. Vnleſſe I be deceiued, the ſwine and other beaſtes are fed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the okes with the acornes, and amonge the pricking briers and thornes the ſwete roſes do grow, the ſharpe beeche giueth vs the ſauoury cheſnutts. I meane, that the deformed and litle creatures oft times are moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the common wealth. For the lytle and ſharpe countenaunces, are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of valiaunt and ſtout hartes. Let vs ceaſe to ſpeake of men which are fleſhely, being eftſones rotten and gone, and let vs talke of ſumptuous buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinges which are of ſtone: which if we ſhould go to ſe what they were, we may know the greatnes and the height of them. Then we ſhal not know the maner of their beauty: and that which ſemed to be perpetuall, in ſhorte ſpace we ſee it ende, and loaſe the renowne, in ſuch ſort that ther is neuer memory of them after. Let vs alſo leaue the auncient buildinges and come to the buildings now a days, and one ſhal ſee that there is no man that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a houſe, be it neuer ſo ſtrong nor ſo faire, but (liuing a lytle while) he ſhal ſee the beauty therof decay. For ther are a great nombre of auncient men, which haue ſene both the toppes of famous and ſtronge buyldings made, &amp; alſo the foundacion and ground therof decayed. And that this is true it ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peareth manyfeſtly, for that if the toppe decay, or the walles fall, or els if the tymber be weke, or the ioyntes open, or the windowes waxe rotten, or the gates do breake, the buildinges forth with do decay. What ſhall we ſay of goodly haules, and galleries well appointed, the which within ſhort ſpace, by coles or candels of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or by torches of pages, or ſmoke of chimneys, by cobwebbes of ſpyders, become as dry &amp; foule, as before they were freſhe and faire. Then if that be true which I haue ſaid of theſe things I would now gladly know, what hope man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuaunce of his beauty, ſince we ſe the like deſtruction of corporal beauty, as of ſtones, wood, bricke, and clay. O vnprofitable Princes, O children of vanity to folyſhe hardy, do you not remember that all your healthe it ſubiecte to ſicknes, as in the payne
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21411:89"/>
of the ſtomack, in the heate of the lyuer, in the inflamacion of the feete, in the diſtemperaunce of humors, the mocions of the ayre, in the coniunctions of the Moone, in the Eclipſe of the ſunne: I ſay do not you knowe that you are ſubiect to the tedyous ſommer, and vntollerable winter? Of a trouth I cannot tel how you can be (among ſo many in perfections and corruptions) ſo full of vaine glory, by your beauty, ſeing and knowinge that a litle feuer doth not only deface and marre the beauty, but alſo maketh and couloureth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> face al yelow, be it neuer ſo wel fauoured. I haue maruailed at one thing, that is to wete, that all men are deſirous to haue all things about their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy cleane, their gownes bruſhed, their coates nette, the table handſome, and the bedde fine, and only they ſuffer their ſoules to be foule, ſpotted, and filthi. I durſt ſay, and in the faith of a chriſtian affirme, that it is a great lacke of wiſedome, and a ſuperfluitie of folye, for a man to haue his houſe cleane, and to ſuffer his ſoule to be corrupted. I would know what preheminence they haue which are fayre, aboue others to whom nature hath denyed beautye. Peraduenture the beauteful man hath two ſoules, and the defourmed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath but one? peraduenture the moſt fayreſt are the moſt healthful, and the moſt deformed are the moſt ſicklyeſt? Peraduenture the moſt fayreſt are the wyſeſt, and the moſt defourmed the moſt innocentes? peraduenture the faireſt are moſt ſtoute, and the defourmed moſt cowardes? peraduenture the fayre are moſt fortunate, and the foule moſt vnluckyeſt? peraduenture the fayre only are excepted from vyce, and the foule depryued from vertue? peraduenture thoſe whych are fayre, of ryght haue perpetuall lyfe, and thoſe whych are foule, are bound to replenyſhe the graue? I ſay no certaynlye. Then if this be true, why do the great mocke the litle, the fayre the foule, the right the crooked, and the whyte the blacke, ſince they know that the vayne glory which they haue, and their beauty alſo, ſhal haue an end to day or to morow. A man that is faire and wel proportyoned, is therfore nothyng the more vertuous: &amp; he that is deformed &amp; euil ſhapen, is nothing therfore the more vicious: ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertue dependeth not at all of the ſhape of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodye, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet vyce procedeth of the deformitye of the face. For dayly we ſe the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formytie of the body, to be beautyfied wyth vertues of the mynd: and the vertues of the mynd, to be defaced wyth the vyce of the body in his works. For truly he that in the vſage of his lyfe hath any botche or imperfectyon, is worſe then he that hath foure botches in hys ſhoulders. Alſo I ſay, that though a man be great, yet it is not true that therfore he is ſtrong: ſo that it is not a general rule, that the bigge body hath always a valiaunt and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious hart, nor the man whych is lytle of parſon, ſhold be of a vyle &amp; falſe hart. For we ſe by experyence, the greateſt men, the moſt cowards: &amp; the leaſt of perſonage, the moſt ſtout and hardy of hart. The holy ſcripture ſpeake of king <hi>Dauid,</hi> that he was redde in his countenaunce, &amp; not bygge of body, but of a meane ſtature, yet not withſtanding as he and the mighty Gyaunt <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> were in campe, <hi>Dauid</hi> kylled <hi>Golias</hi> wyth a ſling, &amp; with hys owne ſword cut of hys head. We ought not maruayle, that a lytle ſheaperde ſhould ſley ſo valyaunt &amp; myghty a Gyaunte. For oft tymes of a lytle ſparke commeth a great lyght: and contrary wiſe by a great torche a man can ſcarſely ſee to do any thinge. This kinge <hi>Dauid</hi> dyd more, that he being lytle of body, and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:90"/>
tender of yeres killed the Lions, &amp; recouered the lambes out of the Woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes throtes, and beſides this in one day in a battaile with his owne handes, he ſlew to the nomber of 800 men. Though we cannot find the like in our tyme, we may well ymagine, that of the 800. which he ſlew, there were at leaſt .300. of theym as noble of linage as he, as riche in goodes, as faire in countenaunce, and as high of ſtature: but none of theſe had ſo much force &amp; courage, ſince he eſcaped aliue, &amp; they remayned in the field deade. Thoughe <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> was bigge enoughe of body, yet notwithſtandinge he was euyll proporcioned: For he had his head all bald, his noſe very ſharpe, one hande more ſhorter then the other. And albeit he was yong, he had his face ryuel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, his coulour ſomewhat yeallowe, and aboue all he went ſomewhat cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, &amp; his girdel was halfe vndone. For men of good wittes do not employ themſelues to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſetting out of their bodyes. <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> was ſo vnhandſome in his bodye, that after the battaile of <hi>Pharſalique,</hi> a neighbour of Rome ſaid vnto the great Oratour <hi>Tullius.</hi> Tell me <hi>Tullius,</hi> why haſt thou folowed the parcialities of <hi>Pompeius</hi> ſince thou art ſo wiſe, knoweſt thou not that <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> ought to be lord and monarche of all the world? <hi>Tullius</hi> then aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I tell the true my frend, that I ſeing <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> in his youth ſo euyl &amp; vnſemely girded, iudged neuer to haue ſene that that is ſene of him, and did neuer greatly regard him. But the old <hi>Silla</hi> knew him better. For he ſeinge <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> ſo vncomely, and ſo ſlouenly appareiled in his youth, oftentimes ſayd vnto the Senate: beware of this yong man ſo euil marked. For if you do not watche wel his procedings, it is he that ſhall hereafter deſtroye the Romaine people as <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> affirmeth in the booke of <hi>Caeſer.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that <hi>Iulius Caeſer</hi> was vncomely in his behauiour, yet in naminge onlye his name he was ſo feared through the worlde, as if bechaunce any king or princes did talke of him at their table, as after ſupper, for feare they coulde not ſlepe that night vntill the next day. As in <hi>Gallia Gotica</hi> wher <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> gaue a battaile, by chaunce a Frenche knight toke a <hi>Ceſarian</hi> knight pryſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who being ledde priſonner by the frenchmen, ſayde <hi>Chaos Ceſar</hi> whyche is to ſay: Let <hi>Caeſar</hi> alone. Which the <hi>Gaulloys</hi> hearing the name of <hi>Caeſer,</hi> let the pryſoner eſcape, and without any other occaſion he fel beſides his horſe. Now then let princes and great lordes ſe, how lytle it auayleth the valiaunt man to be faire or foule, ſith that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> being ſo deformed, only wyth naming his name cauſed all men for feare to chaunge their countenaunce, <hi>Hannibal</hi> the aduenturous Captaine of <hi>Carthage</hi> is called monſtruous, not only for his deedes he did in the world: but alſo for the euyl proporcion of his bodye. For of hys two eyes he lacked the right, and of the two feete he had the left foote croked, and aboue al he was lytle of body, &amp; verye fyerſe &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell of countenaunce. The deedes and conqueſtes which <hi>Hannibal</hi> did among the people of Rome, <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> declareth at large: yet I wyll recite one thing which an hiſtoriographer declareth, and it is this. <hi>Frontine</hi> in the booke of the ſtoutnes of the <hi>Penians</hi> declareth, that in xvii. yeres that <hi>Hannibal</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the Romaines, he ſlew ſo great a nomber that if the men had bene conuerted into Kyne, and that the bloud which was ſhed had bene turned into wine, it had bene ſufficient to haue fylled and ſatiſfyed his hole armye, being 80. thouſand foote men, and 17 thouſande horſe men in his campe.</p>

                        <hi>SExtus Cheronenſis,</hi> in his ſeconde booke of the lyfe of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that this good <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> had a ſyſter called <hi>Annia Milena,</hi> the whiche had a ſonne named <hi>Epeſipus,</hi> who was not onely nephewe, but alſo diſciple to <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> And after he was created Emperour, he ſent his nephewe into Grece to ſtudye the Greeke tongue, and to bannyſhe him from the vices of Rome. This younge <hi>Epeſipus</hi> was of a good and cleare iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement, well made of his body, and fayre of countenaunce: and ſithe in his youth he eſtemed his beautie more then his learninge, the Emperour his vncle wrote him a letter into Grece, whiche ſayde this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the Romaine Emperoure, firſte tribune of the people, and Byſhop, wyſheth to thee <hi>Epeſipus</hi> his nephew, and ſcholler, health and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. In the thirde Calendes of December, came thy coſyn <hi>Annius Verus,</hi> at whoſe comming all our parentage reioyced, and ſo muche the more for that he brought vs newes of Gretia. For truly when the harte hath the abſence of that he loueth, it is no one minute of an houre without ſuſpition. After that thy coſyn <hi>Annius Verus</hi> had ſpoken in generally to all, bryngyng newes from their frendes and chyldren, we talked together, and he gaue me a letter of thyne, whiche is contrary to that was wrytten me out of Grece, becauſe thou wryteſt to me, that I ſhoulde ſende thee money to continue the in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, and they wrote vnto me from thence, that thou arte more youthful and geuen to the pleaſures of the worlde, than becommeth thee. Thou art my bloude, thou arte my Nephewe, thou werte my ſcholler, and thou ſhalte bee my ſonne if thou arte good. But God wyll neuer that thou be my Nephew, nor that I call thee my ſonne, duryng the tyme that thou ſhalt be younge, fonde, lyght &amp; frayle. For no good man ſhould haue parentage with the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I can not denye but that I loued thee from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bottome of my ſtomack, and ſo lykewyſe thy vnthriftynes greaueth me with all my harte. For when I redde the letter of thy follyes, I lette thee knowe that the teares ranne downe my cheekes: but I wyll contente my ſelfe. For the ſage and wyſe men, though (againſte their wylles) they heare of ſuche thynges paſte, yet it pleaſeth them to redreſſe other thynges that maye come hereafter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:91"/>I knowe well thou canſt not call it to mynde, though perhappes thou haſte it, that when thy vnlucky mother, and my ſiſter <hi>Annia Milena</hi> died, ſhe was then young enough, for ſhe was no more but .xviii. yeares of age, and thou haddeſt not then foure houres. For thou were borne in the morning, and ſhe died at nonetide: ſo that when the wycked childe poſſeſſed life, the good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taſted death. I can tell that thou haſt loſt ſuch a mother, and I ſuche a ſiſter, that I beleue there was no better in Rome. For ſhe was ſage, honeſt, and fayre, the whiche thinges are ſeldome ſeene nowe a daies. For ſo muche as thy mother was my ſiſter, and that I had broughte her vp and maried her, I loued her tenderly. And when ſhe died here at Rome, I redde then Rethorike at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> becauſe my pouertie was ſo extreme, that I had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing but that whiche by reading Rethorike I did gette. When newes came vnto me of the death of thy mother, and my ſiſter <hi>Annia Milena,</hi> al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte layde on ſyde, ſorowe oppreſſed my harte in ſuche wyſe, that all my me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers trembled, the bones ſheuered, myne eies without reſte did lamente, the heauy ſighes ouercame me, at euery minute my harte vaniſhed awaye, from the bottome of my harte I inwardly lamented, and bewayled thy vertuous mother and my dere ſyſter. Finally ſorowe executing his priuilege on me, the ioyfull company greued me, and onely with the louely care I quieted my ſelfe. I knowe not, nor can not expreſſe vnto the howe, and in what ſorte I tooke the death of my ſiſter <hi>Annia Milena</hi> thy mother: for in ſleaping I drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of her, and dreaming I ſawe her, when I was awake ſhe repreſented her ſelfe before me, remembring then that ſhe liued, I was ſory to remember her death. Life was ſo greuous vnto me, that I woulde haue reioyced to haue bene put in the graue with her. For truly he feeleth aſſuredly the death of an other, whiche alway is ſorowefull, and lamenting his owne life. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring therefore the great loue whiche my ſiſter <hi>Milena</hi> bare vnto me in her life, and thinking wherein I might requite the ſame after her death: I imagined that I could not by any meanes doe any thing more acceptable for her, then to bryng thee vp, thou whiche arte her chylde, and lefte an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſo young. For of all trauayles, to a woman this is chiefeſt: to leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde her children to bring vp. My ſiſter being dead, the firſte thing I dyd was, that I came to Rome, and then ſent thee to <hi>Capua</hi> to be broughte vp there, in the whiche place, harde at my noſe, they gaue the ſucke two yeares. For thou knoweſt right well, that the money which by reading Rethorike I gate, ſcarcely ſatiſfied for thy dayly finding: but that in the night I reade ſome extraordinary lecture, and with that I payed for the mylke, which thou ſuckedſt on the dugge, ſo that thy bringing vp depended vpon the labour of my lyfe. After that thou wer weyned and brought from the teate, I ſent the to <hi>Bietro,</hi> to a frende and kinſman of mine named <hi>Lucius Valerius,</hi> with whom thou remainedſt vntill fiue yeares were fully accompliſhed, where I founde both him and thee all thinges neceſſary. For he was in great pouertie, and a great babler of his tongue, in ſuche ſorte that he troubled al men, and angred me muche. For truly a man ſhould as willingly geue money to cauſe him to be ſilente, whiche is talkatiue: as to geue to a wyſe man, to heare him ſpeake. The fiue yeares accompliſhed, I ſente thee to <hi>Toringue,</hi> a citie of <hi>Campagnia,</hi> to a maiſter whiche taught children there, called <hi>Emilius Torquates,</hi> of whom,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21411:91"/>
to the end he ſhould teache thee to reade and wryte three yeares: I tooke a ſonne of his, whom he gaue me to reade to him Greke foure yeres, ſo that thou couldeſt not haue any profite in thee, without the encreaſe of my great trauayle, and augmenting paine to my harte. After thou were ſeuen yeares olde, that thou couldeſt reade and wryte well: I ſente thee to ſtudie in the famous citie of <hi>Tarenthe,</hi> where I kept thee foure yeares, paying to the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters a great ſumme of money. Becauſe nowe a dayes through our euyll fortunes, there is none that will teache without great ſtipende. Without lamenting I doe not tell thee, that in the time of the <hi>Cincinos</hi> (whiche were after the death of <hi>Quintus Cincinatus,</hi> vntill <hi>Cyna</hi> and <hi>Catullus</hi>) the philoſophers and maiſters of Rome did neuer receiue one peny to teache ſciences to any that would learne them. For all the philoſophers and maiſters were by the ſacred Senate payde, and none ceaſed to ſtudy for lacke of money. For in thoſe dayes they whiche woulde applie them ſelues to vertue and ſciences, were by the common treaſure mainteined. As our fathers were wel ordered in their thinges: ſo they did not deuide offices by order onely, but alſo by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they paide their money in ſuche ſorte that they paied firſt with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon treaſure, the prieſtes of the temples. Secondly the maiſters of ſcholes and ſtudies. Thirdly the poore wydowes and orphanes. Fourthly the ſtraunge knyghtes, whiche of their owne free wylles voluntarely were made citezins of Rome. Fiftly all the olde ſouldiours, whiche had ſerued. xxxvi. yeares continually in the warres. For thoſe which were retired home to their owne houſes, were honourably founde of the common wealth. The .xii. yeares paſte I my ſelfe was in <hi>Tarenthe,</hi> and caried thee to Rome, where I redde vnto thee Rethorike, Logike, and Philoſophie, and alſo the Mathematicall ſciences, keping thee in my houſe, in my company, at my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in my bedde, and furthermore I hadde thee in my harte, and in my minde. The whiche thinge thou ſhouldeſt eſteme more, then if I gaue thee my houſe and all my goodes. For the true benefite is that onely whiche is done without any reſpect of profite or intereſt. I kepte thee with me thus in this ſorte in <hi>Laurente,</hi> in <hi>Rhodes,</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> and in <hi>Capua,</hi> vntil ſuch tyme as the gods created me Emperour of Rome. And then I determined to ſende thee to Grece, becauſe thou ſhouldeſt learne the Greeke tongue, and alſo to the ende thou ſhouldeſt accuſtome thy ſelfe to worke, that whiche true philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie requireth. For the true and vertuous philoſophers ought to conforme their workes to that they ſay, and publiſhe their wordes with their deades. There is nothing more infamous, then to preſume to be ſage, and to be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be counted vertuous: principally for him that ſpeaketh much, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth litle. For the man of a pleaſant tongue, &amp; euil life, is he which with impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumes vndoeth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. When I ſent thee to Grece, &amp; withdrew thee from Rome, it was not to exyle thee out of my company, ſo that thou hauing taſted of my pouertie, ſhouldeſt not reioyce at my proſperitie: but it was that conſidering thy youthfull diſpoſition and lightnes, I was afrayd to vndo thee in the palace, chiefly leaſt thou wouldeſt haue preſumed to haue bene to bolde &amp; familiar, becauſe thou werte my nephew. For truly princes which take pleaſure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their children be familiar with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thei giue occaſion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men ſhal not count the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wiſe, &amp; cauſe alſo the you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be eſtemed for light
<pb facs="tcp:21411:92"/>
I haue tolde thee that I did for thee in Italy. I will nowe let thee knowe what thou haſt done, and doeſt in Grece, ſo that I wyl ſhewe thee to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that is to knowe, that thou taking and eſteming thy ſelfe to be wel diſpoſed in thy youthe, thou haſte forſaken thy ſtudie, and deſpiſed my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayles, thou arte accompanied with vayne and light men, and haſt viciouſly employed the money which I had ſent thee to bie bookes. All the whiche thinges to thee being hurtfull, are to me no leſſe diſhonour and ſhame. For it is a generall rule, when the childe is fooliſhe and ill taught, the blame and fault is layde on the maiſters necke, who hath taught him, and brought him vp. It greueth me not for that I haue broughte thee vp, neither for that I haue taught thee to reade, and cauſe thee to ſtudy, neither likewyſe to haue kept thee in my houſe, to haue ſet thee at my table, nor alſo to haue ſuffred thee to lye with me in bedde, neither it greueth me to haue conſumed ſo muche money on thee: but with all my harte it greueth me, that thou haſte not geuen me occaſion to doe thee any good. For there is nothing that gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a noble prince more, then not to finde parſons able of capacitie, to doe them any good. They tell me that thou art well made of thy body, and fayre of countenaunce, and that thou preſumeſt alſo in thoſe thinges: wherefore to enioye the pleaſurs of thy perſone, thou haſt forſaken philoſophie, wherwith I am not contented. For in the ende the corporall beautie, earely or late, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth in the graue: but vertue and ſcience, maketh men to be of immortall memory. The gods neuer commaunded it, neither the ſtudies and vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Italy ſuffred it, to haue the body fine and trimme, the viſage fayre &amp; cleare, and the harte full of philoſophie: for the true philoſopher, of all other thinges eſtemeth leſte the ſetting forth of the body. For that the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions &amp; tokens of a true &amp; perfect philoſopher is to haue his eies troubled, his eiebries burnte, &amp; the head bauld, the bal of his eies ſonke into his head, the face yellow, the body leane and feble, the fleſhe drie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feete vnhoſed, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment poore, the eating litle, and the watching great. Finally he ought to liue as a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> and ſpeake as a Grecian. The tokens of a valiaunt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed captaine, are his woundes and hurtes: and the ſigne of a ſtudious philoſopher, is the deſpiſing of the world. For the wyſe man ought to thinke him ſelfe as muche diſhonoured, if they call him ſtoute, and ſturdy: as a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine when they call him a cowarde and negligent. I like well that the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſtudie the auncient antiquities of his forefathers, that wrote the profounde thinges for the time to come, that he teache profitable and holſom doctrines to thoſe whiche are nowe aliue, that he diligently enquire of the mocion of the ſtarres, that he conſider what cauſeth the alteration of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. But I ſweare vnto thee <hi>Epeſipus,</hi> that neuer ſage of Rome came to thoſe thinges, nor philoſopher of Grece likewyſe, but in ſearching the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the ſoule, and deſpiſing the pleaſurs of the body. Touching the body I am like to beaſtes, but concerning the ſpirite I am partely like to the gods, ſithe that following the thinges of the fleſhe I, am made leſſe than my ſelfe, and in following the motions of the ſpirite, I am made more then I am. For truly ſenſualitie maketh vs inferiour to beaſtes, and reaſon maketh vs ſuperiour vnto men. The worldly malice and preſumption naturally deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, rather to mounte then to deſcende: and to commaunde, rather than to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:21411:92"/>
be commaunded. And ſince it is ſo, why doe we by vices abaſe our ſelues to doe leſſe then beaſtes, being poſſible for vs by vertues, to doe more then men? Amongeſt all the members, which men can haue, there is nothing more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to breake, nor any thing more eaſy to corrupte, then is the handeſomenes of the body, wherof we are ſo proude. For in mine opinion, to eſteme him ſelf to be handſome &amp; propre of perſone, is no other thing, but to eſteme our ſelues that dreaming we ſhal be riche and mighty, and afterwardes awaking we finde our ſelues to be poore and miſerable. And me thinketh this thing to be true, becauſe I will declare, what it is to ſe a young man in his firſt age, the hed litle, the heere yeallowe, the browe long, the eies grene, the chekes white, the noſe ſharpe, the lips coloured, the bearde forked, the face liuely, the necke ſmal, the body of good proportion, the armes litle, the fingers longe, &amp; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, ſo wel proportioned in his members, that mens eies ſhoulde alwayes deſire to beholde him, and the hartes alwaies ſeke to loue him. If this young man ſo faire and wel proportioned, remained long time in this beautie and diſpoſition, it were good to deſire it, to procure it, to kepe it, to praiſe it, and to loue it wel: for in the end if we loue the beautie in beaſtes and buildinges, by greater reaſon we ſhould deſire it in our ſelues. But what ſhall we ſaye, that when we doe not watche, this litle floure whiche yeſterday floriſſhed on the tree, faire and whole, without ſuſpicion to be loſt, one litle hory froſt ſodainly waſteth and conſumeth it, the vehement wynde ouerthroweth it, the knife of enuie cutteth it, the water of aduerſitie vndoeth it, and the heate of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions pineth it: and finally the worme of ſhorte life gnaweth it, and the putrifaction of death decayeth and bryngeth it downe to the grounde. O mannes lyfe that arte alwayes curſed, I counte fortune cruell, and thee vnhappy, ſynce ſhe will that thou tarieſt on her, whiche dreaminge geueth the pleaſures, and wakinge woorketh the diſpleaſures: whiche ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth into the handes trauayle to taſte, &amp; ſuffreth thee not only to liſten after quiet: which wil thou proue aduerſitie, and agree not that thou haue proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie but at her will: finally ſhe geueth thee life by ounces, and death without meaſure. The wicked &amp; vicious ſay, that it is a great pleaſure to liue in eaſe: but I proteſt vnto them, that ther was neuer any mortal man had ſo much pleaſure in vices, but that he remained in great paine after that they were banniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. For the harte, which of long time hath ben rooted in vice, incontinently is ſubiect to ſome great alteration. I would all would open their eies to ſee how we liue deceiued: for al the pleaſures which delighte the body, make vs beleue that they come to abide with vs continually, but they vaniſhe awaye with ſorowe immediatly. And on the contrary parte, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and ſorrowes that blynde the ſoule ſaye, that they come onely to lodge as geſtes, and remayne with vs continually as houſholders. I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyle of thee <hi>Epeſipus,</hi> why thou doeſt not conſyder what ſhall become of the beautie of thy bodye hereafter, ſythe thou ſeeſt preſently the beautie of thoſe departed interred in the graue. By the dyuerſitie of fruites, manne dothe knowe the dyuerſytie of trees in the Orcharde, that is to wete, the Oke by the acornes, the Date tree by the dates, &amp; the vines by the grapes: but when the roote is drie, the body cut, the fruite gathered, the leafe fallen, &amp; when the tree is laide on the fire and become aſſhes, I would now know if this aſhes
<pb facs="tcp:21411:93"/>
could be knowen of what tree it was, or howe a man might know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the one from the other? By this compariſon I meane to ſaye, that for ſomuche as the life of this death, and the death of this life co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to ſeke vs out, we are all as trees in the orcharde, whereby ſome are knowen by the rootes of their predeceſſours, others by the leaues of their wordes, others by the braunches of their frendes, ſome in the floures of their beauty, and other ſome by the barke of their foule ſkynne. The one in their merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the other in their ſtoutnes, others in their hardines being aged, others in the haſtines of their youthe, others in their barronnes by their pouertie, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by their fruitfulnes in ryches, fynally in one onely thinge we are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, that is to wete that all vniuerſally goe to the graue, not one remaining. I aſke nowe when death hath done his office, executing all earthely men in the latter daies, what differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is there then betwene the faire and the foule, whiche lie both in the narrowe graue? certainely there is none, and if there be any difference, it ſhalbe in the making of the graues, whiche vayne men inuented. And I doe not repent me for calling them vaine, ſince there is no vanitie nor fondnes comparable to this, for they are not contented to bee vaine in their liues, but will alſo after their deathes eterniſe their vanities in ſumptuous and ſtately ſepulchres. The coale of the Ceder (in my opinion) that is highe and faire, is nothing more whither when it is burnte, then the coale of the Oke which is litle and croked. I meane, oftentimes the gods do permitte, that the bones of a poore Philoſopher are more honoured then the bones of princes. With death I will threathen thee no lenger, for ſithe thou art geuen to the vices of this life, thou wouldeſt not as yet that with a word it ſhould deſtroye thee: but I will tell thee one worde more, though it greue thee to heare it, whiche is, that the Gods created thee to die, men begot thee to die, women bare thee to die, and thou camſte into the worlde for to die: &amp; to conclude I ſaye, ſome are borne to daye, on condition they die to morow, and geue their places to others. When the great and fruitfull trees begin to budde forth by the rootes, it ſignifieth that time draweth on for them, to cut the drie and wythered braunches. I meane that to ſee children borne in the houſe is no other, but to cite the grandfathers and fathers to the graue. If a man would aſke me what death is, I woulde ſaye a miſerable lake wherin all worldly men are taken. For thoſe that moſt ſafely thinke to paſſe it ouer, remaine therein moſte ſubtilly deceiued. I haue alwayes redde of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes paſt, and haue ſeene of the younge men preſent, and I ſuppoſe that the ſelfe ſame will be to come hereafter. That when life moſt ſweteſt ſemeth to any man, then ſodainly death entreth in at their dores. O immortal gods, I can not tell if I may call you cruell, I knowe not if I may call you merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, becauſe you gaue vs fleſhe, bones, honour, goodes, frendes, and alſo ye geue vs pleaſure: finally ye geue to men all that they wante, ſaue onely the cuppe of lyfe, whiche to your ſelues you did reſerue. Since I may not that I would, I will that I may: but if it were referred to my will, I woulde rather one onely day of life, then all the ryches of Rome. For what auayleth it to toyle and take paine to increaſe honour, and worldly goodes: ſince lyfe daily diminiſheth. Returning therfore to my firſt purpoſe, thou muſt knowe, that thou eſtemeſt thy ſelfe, and glorifieſt in thy perſonage and beautie: I
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21411:93"/>
would gladly know of the, and of others whiche are yonge and faire, if you doe not remember that once ye muſt come to be olde and rotten. For if you thinke you ſhall lyue but a lytle, then reaſon woulde you ſhoulde not eſteme youre beauties muche: for by reaſon it is a ſtraunge thinge, that lyfe ſhoulde abate vs, and folie trayne vs. Yf you thinke to become aged, ye ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and alwayes to thinke, that the ſteele of the knyfe, whiche dothe muche ſeruice, at length decayeth and is loſt for lacke of lokynge to. Trulye the yong man, is but a new knyfe, the whiche in proceſſe of tyme cankerethe in the edge: for on one daye he breaketh the poynte of vnderſtandynge, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he loſeth the edge of cuttyng, and to morow the ruſt of diſeaſes taketh him, and afterwardes by aduerſitie he is writhen, and by infirmities he is diſeaſed, by riches he is whetted, by pouerty he is dulled agayne: and finally, oftentimes it chaunſeth that the more ſharpe he is whetted, ſo muche the more the lyfe is put in haſarde. It is a true thinge, that the fete and handes are neceſſary to clyme to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vanyties of youth: and that afterwardes ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blynge a lytle, immediately rowling the heade downewardes, we diſcende into the miſerie of age. For (to oure ſeamynge) yeſterdaye we knewe one, that was yonge and beautifull: and with in ſhorte tyme after, we heare that he is dead and rotten. When I conſider manye men, aſwell frendes as enemyes, whiche were (not long a goe) floriſſhyng in beautye and youth, and preſently I ſee them to be olde and drye, ſycke and foule, truly I think that as then I dreamed of them, or that they be not nowe as they were then. What thynge is more fearefull, or more incredible, then to ſee a man become miſerable, in ſhorte ſpace, that the faſhion of his viſage ſhoulde chaunge, the beautie of the face ſhoulde be loſte, the beard waxe whyte, the heade bauld, the cheekes and forheade full of wrynckelles, the teethe (as whit as Iuorye) become blacke, the lighte feete by the goute to ſeme crepeled, and afterwarde waxeth heauie, the palſey weakeneth the ſtrong arme, the fyne ſmothe throte with wrinckelles is pleated, and the bodye that was ſtreight and vpryghte, waxeth weake and croked. Aboue all that I haue ſpoken, I ſay to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Epeſipus</hi> (which preſumeſt to be faire) that he which through hys pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernes in youth was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mirrour of all, becommeth to be ſuch a one, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth whether he be the ſelfe ſame now in his age, that he was in his youth. Doe what thou wilte, prayſe and gloryfye thy beautie aſmuch as thou thinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt good, yet in the ende the beautie of men is none other: but as a veile to couer their eyes, a payre of fetters for the fete, manacles for the handes, a lyme rodde for the winges, a theſe of tyme, an occaſion of daunger, a prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of trouble, a place of lecherye, a ſinke of all euill. and fynallye it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentour of debates, and a ſcourge of the affectioned man. Since thou haſte forſaken thy ſtudye, I am not bound to ſend the any thing, chiefely waſting thy monye in childyſh and youthfull toyes: but notwithſtandyng all thoſe thinges, I ſende the by <hi>Aulus Vegenus</hi> two thouſande crounes for thy appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raile, and trulye thou ſhalt be very vnthankfull, if thou doſt not knowe the benefite done vnto the. For a man ought to giue more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes for that which is done of curteſie: then for that which is offered of neceſſitie. I cannot tell, what to let the vnderſtande in theſe partes, but that thy ſiſter <hi>Anania Salaria</hi> is maried, who ſayeth ſhe is contente. I praye God it be ſo, for with money
<pb facs="tcp:21411:94"/>
men maye be holpen to mariages: but it lyeth in the gods to contente the parties. If thou wilte know of <hi>Toringa</hi> thy coſen, thou ſhalte vnderſtande ſhe is imbarked in the fleete whyche went to <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in dede I neuer thought otherwiſe on her, after ſhe had hene .3. dayes hydde in the waye of <hi>Salaria.</hi> For maydes that will betimes gather their grapesi: t is a token that they will goe on warfare with ſouldyars. Of <hi>Annius Rufus</hi> thy frende and companion, I certify the that he is gon into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Ile</hi> of <hi>Heleſpont,</hi> and he goeth by the authority of the ſenate, to vnderſtand the gouernement therof: and albeit he be yong, yet he is wiſe, and therfore I ſuppoſe he will render a good accompt of his commiſſion. For of theſe two extremities, the aged that do decline, or the yong that are wiſe: I had rather holde my ſelfe to the wiſdom of the yong, then to the white berdes of the aged. My wife <hi>Fauſtine</hi> ſaluteth the, and be thou aſſured that in thy affaires (at the leaſt to my ſeming) ſhe is very fauourable vnto the, and dayly ſhe inſtauntely requireth me not to be angrye with the, ſayenge: that ſage men oughte not to eſteme the lyghtenes of youth, and that there is no olde man that is ſage, but he which in all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, was lighte and youthefull. I ſay no more to the in this caſe, but if thou wylte be good, I cannot denaye that thou art not my nepheue, my old ſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and ſeruaunte. For if in the I ſe amendment, I wil withdrawe mine ire. For trulye amonge the louing hartes, there is nothing that plucketh vp the euill will, vnles it be the good lyfe.

                     <p>ONe of the chiefeſt thynges that wanne reputacion and eternall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morye to the auncient princes and Gouerners, was that they ſought wyſe men to be alwayes couerſaunt about them, whoſe graue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile their realmes alwayes obſerued, and obeyed. It profiteth a king litle, to leade with him a greate nomber of ſages, to gouerne him and his realme: if his ſubiectes are armed with malice not to obey hym. Let princes knowe, whiche eſteme not the counſaile of ſages, that their commaundement of other ſhall not be regarded. For the lawe whiche by will is made, and not of right ordeined, deſerueth not to be obeyed. We which turne and toſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of the auncient hiſtories cannot denay, but that the romaines naturally were proude. Yet we muſte confeſſe, that as they haue ben ſtout in thinges touching warres: ſo they haue ſhewed them ſelues temperate, in the affaires of the publike weale. And truly herin Rome declared her wiſedom &amp; might, for as by hardye and ſtoute captaynes the enemies were deſtroied in warre: ſo by ſages and wiſe men the common wealth was gouerned and maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in peace. Ofte tymes with my ſelfe I muſe whereuppon all theſe diſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des grew, betwene lords and ſubiectes, princes and vaſſalles: and my count being made, I finde that they haue both reaſon. For the ſubiectes complaine of the litle loue of their lorde: and the lordes complaine of the great diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of their ſubiectes. For to ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, diſobedience is ſo much augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21411:94"/>
and the deſier of commaundement is become ſo licencious, that it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the ſubiectes that the waighte of a fether is lead: and on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary it ſemeth to princes that for the flieng of a flye, they ſhould draw their ſwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. All this euill and damage commeth not, but becauſe the princes haue not with them wiſe men, whiche maye counſaile them: for there was neuer any good prince, that credited euil counſaile. There are two thinges in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and prelates whiche gouerne the ſoule, thone is the dignitie of the office, and the other is the nature of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſon. It may wel be that on may be good in his perſon, and euill in his gouernement: and the contrary, he may be euil of his perſon, and good in gouernement. And therfore <hi>Tullius Cicero</hi> ſayeth, that there neuer was nor ſhall be ſuch a <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> in his perſon, nor ſo euill a gouernour as he was for the common wealth. It is a great grace in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be good, but it is much more that he be a good prince: and for the contrary, it is a great euil for a man to be euill, but it is much worſe for him to be an euil prince. For the euill man is only euil to him ſelfe, but the euill prince indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageth al others: for the more the poiſon is ſcatered through the body, in ſo much more daunger he is of his lyfe. I meane, the more power a man hath ouer the common wealth: ſo much the more euil and domage he doth if his life be euill. I maruell why princes and great lordes ſhould be ſo curious to ſerche the beſt medicines to cure their bodies: &amp; that they are ſo ſlacke &amp; ſlow in ſeking ſage perſons to gouerne their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. For w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon, it is greater domage that the common wealth be euill gouerned, then if the prince and gouernour therof ſhould be ſicke in his perſon. Hitherto we haue neyther red nor ſene that any Prince haue perriſhed for lacke of phiſike, but for lacke of counſailours we haue ſeen and red of infinite kinges and realmes that haue ben deſtroyed, and vtterly vndone.</p>
                     <p>The lacke of a phiſicion maye cauſe daunger in mans perſon: but the lacke of a wiſe man, may ſet diſcord amongeſt the people. For where ther is any tumulte amongeſt the people a ripe counſaile of a wyſe man profiteth more: then a hundreth purgacions of rubarbe. <hi>Iſidorus</hi> in the forth boke of his <hi>Etimologies</hi> affirmeth, that the romaines were foure hundreth yeares with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out phiſicions. For <hi>Eſculapius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Apollo</hi> was the laſte phiſician in <hi>Grece.</hi> And in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the ſame <hi>Eſculapius,</hi> they ſet by the image of <hi>Archa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buto,</hi> a man very notable in ſurgery. For the romaynes were ſo beneficious to vertuous parſones, that to euery on that exceaded other in any kynde of vertue, they rewarded him with mony, they ſet vp a ſtatute of him for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, or els they made him fre in the common wealth. And then when the ſurgian <hi>Archabuto</hi> was become auncient, and very riche, &amp; when by occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great and daungerous wondes he dyd cutte of the armes and legges of certayne Romaynes, they thought him a cruell an vnnaturall man. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they droue him out of his houſe, and killed hym with ſtones in the fielde of <hi>Mars.</hi> And let no man maruel therat, for ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times men ſuffer leſſe harme in enduring the paine, then to tary for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruell remedies the ſurgians applie vnto it. Some men will ſay, that when Rome was without ſurgians, the romaynes were diſconfaited and halfe loſt. To this I wil aunſwere, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they neuer had a more proſperous time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .400. yers when they wer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ſurgians. For then was Rome vndone, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they receiued ſurgions, for at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tune they droue philoſophers out of rome. I do not ſpeake this as a preiudice
<pb facs="tcp:21411:95"/>
to any ſurgian, for me thinketh that princes cannot be without ſome amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them. For as the fleſhe is feble and delicate, ſo dayly nedeth it remedies to comforte it. The ſage ſurgeons geueth vs none but good and healthfull counſailes. For they do not perſwade vs to any other thing, but that we be: ſober and continent, in eating, drynking, ſleapinge, trauailing, and workinge and that in all thinges we ſhould be temperat. The end why I ſpeake theſe thinges is, to perſwade princes, prelates, and great lordes, that the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence they haue to ſeke ſurgeans, &amp; the ſomme of money they waſt to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne and content them, they ſhould ſpend parte of that to ſeke wiſe men to counſaile their perſonnes. For if men knewe what it were to keape a wyſe man, to commaunde in their houſe, they would giue for on only wiſe man al their goods. Ye ought to haue pitie and compaſſion vpon thoſe princes, and great lordes, which loſe ſo many dayes in the moneth, and ſo many houres in the daye, in ſpeaking of warres, buildinges, weapons, meates, beaſtes, of huntinges, and medecines, and oftentimes of othermens doinges, &amp; of other vaine thinges, not neceſſary for mans lyfe. And this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication they vſe with thoſe that are neither vertuous, nor wiſe: the which can neither wiſely talke, nor yet aunſwere directly vnto that whiche is aſked. Oftentimes it chaunſeth that a prince at randon moueth a matter, which they neuer ſawe writen before, nor with their eares they neuer hard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like, neither in all their life time they had knowledge therof, and yet they will ſeme to giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, (or better to ſaye) obſtinatlie to cotend, as if all the dayes of their lyfe they had ſtudyed it: which thing procedeth of great ſhame, and euil brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng vp. For the priuy counſaile may ſpeake before their princes, but be they neuer ſo priuye, with licence or without licence it is not lawfull for them to contend. <hi>Helius Spartianus</hi> in the lyfe of <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> ſayeth, that the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Seuerus</hi> was demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded once by an embaſſadour of <hi>Graece,</hi> what thing was moſt painefull to hym in Rome? wherunto the emperour aunſwered. There is nothing greueth me more, then when I am mery, that my ſeruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſhould rayſe any ſtrife or debate: I am not diſpleaſed that matters ſhuld be debated, but this greueth me when on wil obſtinately ſtriue, that hath no ground of that he ſpeaketh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whych giueth reaſon of that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, cannot be called obſtinate. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperoure was once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded what a prince ought to do to be good, wherunto he au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered, the vertuous prince whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he goeth abroad, ought to haue graue and wiſe men in his compagnie to diſcourſe with all, when he is at his meate to haue wyſe men at his bourde diſputing, and when he withdraweth him ſelf a parte to be reading with wiſe men: and finally at all vacant tymes, he ought to be founde with ſage men counſaling. For the knight which entreth into bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile without weapons, is as hardye as the prince whiche will gouerne the common wealth, without the counſaile of wyſe men. <hi>Lampridius</hi> in the booke of the Romayne geſtes ſaieth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> nether at hys meate, at his going to bed, at his vpriſing, in his trauaile, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, nor ſecretely, ſuffered at any time that fooles ſhuld ſing or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with him, but only wiſe &amp; vertuous men, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> always he moſt intierly loued. Of truthe he had reaſon, for there is nothing, be it in ieſt or in earneſt, but is better lyked of a wiſe man, then of a foole. Yf a prince be ſad, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not a wiſe man peraduenture by the ſaienge of the holy ſcripture counſell him better, then a foole by folyſh
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21411:95"/>
wordes? Yf a Prince be proſperous, ſhall it not be better (to kepe him in the ſame proſperity) to aſſociate him ſelfe with a wyſe man, rather then to put his truſt in a foole and malicious perſon? Yf a prince be deſtitute of money, cannot perchaunce a wiſe man find him better meanes to get it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a foole which doth nothing but aſke? If a prince wil paſſe the time away, ſhall not he be more comforted with a wiſe man, that rekeneth vnto him the ſauorye hiſtories done in times paſt, then harkening a foole ſpeakyng foliſhely, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring thinges diſhoneſtly, with the ſayenges of the malicious of the tyme preſent? That that I ſpeake of ſurgians, the ſelfe ſame I ſpeake of foles. For I do not ſay that they keape them for their paſtime, though truly we might better ſay to loaſe their time, then to paſſe their time. For that may iuſtly be called time loſt, which is ſpent without the ſeruice of God, &amp; profite of theyr neighbours. That which I moſt maruel at is, not ſo much for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rity y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fooles haue in the pallaces of princes &amp; great lordes, as for the litle ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour &amp; credite which wiſe men haue among them. For it is a great iniury, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fooles ſhould enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palace of princes euen vnto their bed ſide, and that one wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not nor dare not enter into the halle. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to the on there is no dore ſhut: and to the other there is no gate open. We which are at this preſent, of right do commend thoſe. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were before vs, for no other cauſe, but that in times paſt, though the ſages were few in nomber, &amp; the world was repleniſhed with barbarous people: yet the ſages of thoſe barbarous people were greatly eſtemed, and had in reuerence. And this cuſtome endured long tyme in <hi>Grece,</hi> that when a philoſopher paſſed by a Greke, he roſe and ſpake vnto hym, and he might not ſit: for the contrary, al thoſe which ſhal liue here after will reproue vs which are at this preſente. Foraſmuch as we haue ſo great a multitude of ſages, and do not liue amongeſt barbarous, but amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Chriſtians: and it is a grefe to ſee, and ſhame to write, how litle wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are eſtemed. For at this day (throughe oure offences) not thoſe which haue moſt ſcience: but thoſe which haue moſt ryches, in the common wealthe doe commaund. I know not whether the deuine wiſdom hath depriued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or that the worldly malice hath loſt the taſt of them. For now a dayes ther is no ſage, that liueth al alone to be wiſe, but it is neceſſary for him to trauaile how to gaine his liuing: for neceſſitie enforceth him, to violate the rules of true philoſophy. O world, world, I know not how to eſcape thy handes, nor how the ſimple man &amp; ideote defendeth him ſelfe out of thy ſnares, when the ſage and wyſe men (yea with al their wiſdome) can ſcarſely ſet their foote ſure on the ground. For al that wiſe men of this world know, is litle ynough to defend them from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> malitious. Readyng that which I read of time paſt, and ſeing that which I ſe of time preſent: I am in doubte which was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the care that vertuous princes had in ſeekyng out ſages to counſell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or the great couetouſnes that others haue at this preſent, to diſcouer mynes and treaſures. Speaking therfore in this matter as I thinke, I deſire that thoſe which haue the charge of gouernement (whether he be prince, prelate, or priuate parſon I paſſe not) that they once may haue about them ſage me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that be wiſe in dede, and that they would loue them aboue all the treaſour they had heaped. For in the end, of good counſaill there commeth profite: and much treaſour, is a token of great daunger. In the old time when vertuous
<pb facs="tcp:21411:96"/>
Princes died, and that they lefte their children for ſucceſſours in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almes, &amp; beſides that foraſmuch as they ſaw their children yong, &amp; euill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the affaires of their realmes, they committed them to tutours, that ſhould teache the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good workes &amp; doctrine: rather than they would giue them ſurueyours, whych ſhould encreaſe &amp; augment their cofers and rentes. For truly if the common wealth be defended with great treaſures, it is not gouerned with good counſayles. The princes which are yong, accuſtomely are giuen to vyces: for in the one part youth reigneth, &amp; on the other part ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty wanteth. And to ſuch truly vices ar very daungerous, ſpecially if they want ſages to counſaile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to keape them from euil company. For the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious youth will not be brydeled, nor their great libertie can be chaſtyſed. Princes without doubt haue more nede of wyſe men about them, to profyte them in their counſailes: then any of all their other ſubiectes. For ſynce they are in the view of all, they haue leſſe licence to commyt vice than any of all. For if they doe behold all, and that they haue auctoritie to iudge all, will they nill they, they are beholden and iudged of all. Princes ought to be circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpect whom they truſt with the gouerneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their realmes, and to whom they commytte the leading of their armies: whom they ſend as embaſſatours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtraunge countreys, and whom they truſt to receiue and keape their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurs: but much more they ought to be circumſpecte in examinyng of thoſe whom they chooſe to be their counſalours. For looke what he is that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaileth the Prince at home in his palace: ſo likewyſe ſhall his renowne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e in ſtraunge countreis, and in his owne common wealthe. Why ſhould they not then willingly examin, and correct their own proper palace? Let princes know, if they doe not know, that of the honeſtie of their ſeruauntes, of the prouidence of their counſayles, of the ſagenes of their perſonnes, and of the order of their houſe, dependeth the welfare of the common wealth. For it is impoſſible that the braunches of that tree, whoſe rootes are dried vp, ſhould be ſene to beare grene leaues.</p>

                        <hi>IGnatius</hi> the Hyſtorian in the boke that he made of the .2. <hi>Theodoſij,</hi> of the .3. <hi>Archadij,</hi> and of the .4. <hi>Honorii</hi> declareth, that the firſt and great <hi>Theodoſius</hi> being fyftie yeares old, and hauing gouerned the Empire .11. yers, lyenge on his death bed, called <hi>Archadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> his .2. ſonnes, and committed them to <hi>Eſtilconus</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus</hi> to be inſtructed, and ordeined them lykewiſe for gouerners of their eſtates, and ſignories. Before that the father dyed he had now created his children Ceſars, beyng then of the age of .17. yeares. Therfore the father ſeynge them not as yet rype, nor able to gouerne their Realmes and ſignories: he committed them vnto maiſters and tutours. It is not alwayes a generall rule, though one be of .25. yeares of age, that he hath more diſcretion to gouerne realmes then another of .17. For dayly we ſee, that we allow and commend the .10. yeares of one, and reproue the .40. yeares of an other. Ther are many princes tender of yeres, but ripe in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes: and for the countrary there are other princes old in yeares, &amp; yong in counſailes. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good Emperour <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> died, they determined to put his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne <hi>Titus</hi> in the gouernement of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> empire, or ſome other aged Senator,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21411:96"/>
becauſe they ſaid <hi>Titus</hi> was to yong. And as they were in controuerſie of the matter, the Senatour <hi>Rogerus Patroclus</hi> ſaid vnto the Senate. For my parte I require rather a Prince which is yong, and ſage: then I do a prince which is old and foolyſh. Therfore now as touchyng the children of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> one day <hi>Eſtilconus</hi> the tutour of <hi>Archadius</hi> ſpeaking to a greke philoſopher, very ſage, whoſe name was <hi>Epimundus,</hi> ſayde thus vnto him. Thou and I long time haue bene acquainted together in the palace of the emperour <hi>Theodoſe,</hi> my lord, who is dead and we ar aliue: thou knoweſt it had bene better that we .2. had died, and that he had liued. For there be many to be ſeruauntes of princes, but there ar few to be good princes. I feele no greater griefe in this world, than to know many princes in one realme. For the man whiche hath ſene many princes in his lyfe: hath ſene many nouelties and alterations in the common wealth. Thou knoweſt well that when <hi>Theodoſius</hi> my maiſter died, he ſpake to me theſe wordes, the which wer not ſpoken without great ſighes: and multiplienge of teares. O <hi>Eſtilconus</hi> I dye, and am going into an other world, wherin I ſhall giue a ſtreighte accompte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Realmes and ſeignories which I had vnder my charge: And therfore when I thinke of myne offences, I am meruelouſly afrayed. But when I remember y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercy of God, then I receiue ſome conforte and hope. As it is but mete we ſhould truſt in the greatnes of his mercy: ſo likewiſe is it reaſon we ſhould feare the rigour of his iuſtice. For truly in the chriſtian law they are not ſuffred to liue (as we which are Princes that liue in delightes of this world) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward without repentaunce to goe ſtreighte to Paradyſe. Then when I thinke of the great benefittes which I haue receiued of God, and of the great offences which I haue committed, &amp; when I thynke of the long tyme I haue lyued, and of the litle which I haue profited, &amp; alſo that vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly I haue ſpent my time: On the one part I am loath to dye, for that I am afrayed to come before the tribunall ſeate of Ieſus Chriſt: and on the other part, I would liue no lenger, becauſe I do not profit. The ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an euil life, why doth he deſire to lyue any longer? My lyfe is now finiſhed, &amp; the tyme is ſhorte to make amendes. And ſithe god demaundeth nought els but a contrite harte, with all my harte I doe repente, and appeale to his iuſtice, of mercie, from his Iuſtice to his mercy, becauſe it maye pleaſe him to receiue me into his houſe, and to giue me perpetuall glorie, to the confuſion of al my ſynnes and offences. And I proteſt I dye in the holy catholike faith, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my ſoule to god, &amp; my body to the earth, &amp; to you <hi>Eſtilconus</hi> &amp; <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> my faithful ſeruauntes, I reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende my dere beloued children. For herby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ſene, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the father forgetteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not at the houre of his death. In this caſe of one only thing I doe warne you, one only thing I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire you, one only thing I deſire you, &amp; one onely thing I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund you, &amp; that is, that you occupye not your mindes in augmentinge the Realmes &amp; ſeignories of my childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but only that you haue due reſpect to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good education &amp; vertuous ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. For it was only the wiſe men which I had about me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thus long haue mainteined me in this great auctoritie. It is a goodly thing for a prince to haue ſtoute captains for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres: but without compariſon it is better to keape &amp; haue wiſe men in his palace. For in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, the victory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battaille conſiſteth in the force of many: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernement
<pb facs="tcp:21411:97"/>
of the common weale oftentimes is putte vnder the aduiſe of one alone. Theſe ſo dolefull and pitiefull wordes, my lord and maiſter <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſpake vnto me: now tell me <hi>Epimundus</hi> what I ſhould doe at this preſent, to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill his commaundement? For at his harte he had nothing that troubled him ſo much, as to thinke whether his children would vndoe, or encreaſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthe. Thou <hi>Epimundus,</hi> thou art a Grecian, thou art a philoſopher, thou haſt vnderſtandyng, thou art an olde ſeruaunt, thou arte my faithfull frend, therfore for al theſe thinges thou art bound to giue me good &amp; health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful counſaile. For many times I haue heard <hi>Theodoſius</hi> my maiſter ſay, that he is not accompted ſage which hath turned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaues of many bookes: but he which knoweth, and can geue good &amp; healthful counſailes. <hi>Epimundus</hi> the philoſopher aunſwered to theſe wordes. Thou knoweſt wel Lord <hi>Eſtilconus,</hi> that the auncientes and great Philoſophers, ought to be brief in wordes, and very parfect in their workes. For otherwiſe to ſpeake muche, &amp; worke litle, ſemeth rather to be done like a tyraunt: then like a greeke philoſopher. The Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was thy Lord, and my frend. I ſay frend, becauſe it is the libertie of a greeke Philoſopher, to acknowledge no homage nor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to any ſuperiour. For he in his hart can haue no true ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to rebuke the viicous kepeth his mouth ſhut. In one thing I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent my ſelfe in <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſe</hi> aboue al other princes, which were in the Romaine empire, and that is, that he knew and talked wiſely of al his affaires, and alſo was very dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to execute the ſame. For all the fault of Princes is, that they are prompte &amp; bold to talke of vertues: and in executing them, they are very ſlacke &amp; feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For ſuch Princes can not continew in the vertue, which they doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende: nor yet reſyſte the vyce, which they do diſpraiſe. I graunt that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> was an executour of iuſtice, mercifull, ſtoute, ſober, valiaunt, true, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, thankfull, and vertuous: and finally in all thinges, and at all times he was fortunate. For fortune oftentimes bringeth that to Princes, which they will and deſire: yea many times better then they looke for. Preſuppoſe it to be true (as it is moſt true) that the time was alwayes proſperous to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> yet I doubte whether this proſperity wil continew in the ſucceſſion of his children. For worldlye proſperitie is ſo mutable, that with one only man, in a moment, ſhe maketh a thouſande ſhrewde turnes: and ſo much the more it is harde to continue ſtedfaſt in the ſecond heyre. Of ſlowe and dull horſes, come oftentimes couragious and fyerſe coltes: and euyn ſo of vertuous fathers, come children euill brought vp. For the wicked children inherite the worſte of the father, whiche is ryches: and are dyſenherited of the beſt, whiche are vertues. That whiche I perceyue in this matter, as wel of the father whiche is dead, as of the children whyche are alyue, is that <hi>Theodoſe</hi> was vertuous in deede, and the children are capable to follow both good and euill, and therfore it is requiſite that you nowe goe aboute it. For the prince whyche is yonge, is in greate perill, when in hys youth he begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to folowe the ſteppes of vertue. To ſpeake particulerly of <hi>Archa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> and <hi>Honorius,</hi> I let the know <hi>Eſtilconus,</hi> that it is a thyng ſuperfluous to talke of it, for I ſhould loaſe my tyme: becauſe the thynges of Prynces are very delicate, and though we haue lycence to prayſe theyr vertues, yet we are bounde to diſſemble their faultes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:21411:97"/>As a ſage father <hi>Theodoſe</hi> deſire y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to giue his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good doctrine, &amp; always to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany them: But I as a frend do counſaile y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, that thou kepe them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euil. For in the end al is euil, to accompany with the euil, &amp; forſake the good: but the worſe euill purſueth vs, rather by the preſence of the euill, than by the abſence of the good. It may wel be, that one beyng alone, &amp; without the company of the good, may yet notwithſtandyng be good: but for one that is accompanied with euil men, to be good, of this I greatly doubte. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame day: that a man accompanieth him ſelfe with the vicious: the ſelfe ſame day he is bound to be ſubiecte to vice. O <hi>Eſtilconus,</hi> ſince thou ſo much deſireſt to accompliſhe the commaundement of thy lord and maiſter <hi>Theodoſe,</hi> if thou canſt not cauſe that <hi>Archadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> (which are yong princes) doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company with the good: yet at the leaſt withdraw them from the company of the euil. For in the courtes of princes vicious men are none other, but ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citours in this world to attempte others to be vitious. How many, &amp; what ſolicitours haue we ſeene (thou and I in Rome) the which forgetting the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of their Lordes, did ſolicite for them ſelues, vices and pleaſurs. I will not tell what ſeruauntes of princes haue bene in times paſt: but what they were, &amp; what they are, euery man may eaſely ſee. I will tell the only, not of thoſe whiche ought to be counſellours of princes: but alſo of thoſe, whyche ought not to liue in their courtes. For the counſellers and officers of princes ought to be ſo iuſt: that ſheares can not finde what to cut away in their ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, nor that ther neadeth any nedle or thred to amend their fame. If thou <hi>Eſtilconus</hi> haſte hard what I haue ſayd: marke now what I wyll ſaye, and keape it in memory, for peraduenture it may profite the one daye.</p>
                     <p>In the courtes of princes, proude men ought to haue no familiarity nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteinement. For it is vnſemely that thoſe which are not gentle in wordes, ſhuld commaund: &amp; thoſe that haue not their hartes ready to obey, ſhould be familier with the prince. In the courtes of princes, ther ought not to be of counſaile, &amp; much leſſe familiar, enuious men: for if enuie reigne amongeſte Princes and counſailours, there ſhall alwayes be diſcentions in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. In the courts of princes haſty men ought not to haue familiaritie: for oftentimes it chaunceth, that the impacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the counſellers, cauſeth the people to be euill content with their princes. In the courtes of princes ther ought not to be familiar, nor of counſaile, gready nor couetous men: for the Princes giue great occaſion to the people to be hated, becauſe their ſeruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes haue alwayes their handes open to receyue bribes. In the courtes of princes ther ought not to be familiar fleſhelye men: for the vice of the fleſhe hath in it ſo litle profite, that he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is wholie ouercome ther with, is or ought to be to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince alway ſuſpected. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palace of a king ther ought not to be drunkerdes, nor gluttons: for wheras the familiers ought principaly to ſerue their princes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile, in mine opinion a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being full &amp; ſurcharged with exces is more like to bealche &amp; breake wind after his ſurfette: then able to gyue any profitable counſaile in the common wealth. In the palace of princes ought not to be reſient nor familiar blaſphemers: for the man whiche is a ſeruaunt, and openlye dare blaſpeme his creator: will not ſpare in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to ſpeake euyll of hys Lorde.</p>
                     <p>In the palace of princes ought not to be of counſail, nor familiar, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> negligent and delicat perſons: For ther is nothing (next vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuine prouidence) that

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes are faythful, and diligent. In the palace of princes defamed men ought not to haue familiaritie: for the prince can not excuſe him ſelfe to be thought culpable when they doe rebuke him, if in his houſe he mainteyne ſeruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, which openly are defamed.

Thou doeſt eſteme litle (as truth is) theſe my ſmall giftes, and preſentes which I ſend the: yet I praye the greatly eſteme the will and hart wherwith I doe viſite the. For noble hartes receyue more thankefully that whych a man deſireth to gyue them: then that which they doe giue them in dede.

                        <p>
                           <hi>ANacharſis</hi> the leaſt of the philoſophers, wiſheth to the <hi>Creſus,</hi> moſt migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye and puiſſaunt king of <hi>Lides,</hi> the health whiche thou wiſſheſt hym, and the increaſe of vertue which thou ſendeſt him. They haue told vs many thinges here in theſe parties, aſwel of thy realme, as of thy perſon, and there in thoſe parties they ſay many thinges, as wel of our vniuerſity, as of my ſelfe. For the harte taketh greate pleaſour, to knowe the condicions and liues of all thoſe in the world. It is wel done to deſier and procure to know all the liues of the euill, to amend our owne. It is wel done to procure and knowe the liues of the good for to follow them: but what ſhall we do, ſince now a dayes the euill doe not deſire to knowe the liues of the euil, but for to couer them and kepe them ſecrete, and do not deſier to know the liues of the good for to followe them. I let the know (king <hi>Creſus</hi>) that the philophers of <hi>Greece</hi> felte not ſo muche payne to be vertuous, as they felte in defendyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the vicious. For if a man once behold vertue, immediatly ſhe ſuffreth to be taken: but the euil for any good that a man can doe vnto them, neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth them ſelues to be vanquiſhed. I beleue well that the tirannye of the Realme is not ſo great as they talke of here, neyther oughteſt thou lykewyſe to beleue that I am ſo vertuous, as they reporte me to be there. For in mine opinion thoſe whiche declare newes of ſtraunge countries, are as the poore which were their garmentes al to patched and peced, wherof the peces that were ſowen on of new, are in more quantity of clothe: then the olde whyche before they had, when they were firſt made. Beware (king <hi>Creſus</hi>) and be not as the barbarous princes are, which vſe good wordes, and euill dedes. For they go about with faire wordes, to couer the infamie of their cruel dedes. Meruell not though we philoſophers, readers in ſcholes, deſire not to liue with you Princes, gouernours of Realmes. For euil Princes for none other intente ſeke the companye of wyſe menne, but onelye becauſe they woulde throughe them excuſe their faultes. For doinge as thou doeſt (of wyll, and not of ryghte) you will that the vulger people thincke you doe it by the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle of a wyſe man. I let the vnderſtande (Kynge <hi>Creſus</hi>) that the Prince which deſireth to gouerne his people wel, oughte not to be contente to haue one only ſage in his palace. For it is not mete that the gouernement of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, doe conſiſte in the aduiſe of one alone. Thy imbaſſadour hath ſayde by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:21411:99"/>
worde, and the ſelfe ſame thy letter teſtifieth, that thou arte certified that I am counted for ſage throughout all Greece, and that this preſuppoſed, I woulde come to thee to gouerne thy common wealthe. And for the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thou doyng thus (as thou doeſt) condemneſt me to be an Idiote, for thou thynkyng that I woulde take thy golde is nothyng els, but for to rayle vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon me as a foole. The chiefe poynte wherein true philoſophie is knowen, is when he diſpyſeth the thinges of the worlde: for there neuer agreeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the lybertie of the ſoule, and the care of goodes in this lyfe. O kyng <hi>Creſus,</hi> I let thee vnderſtande, that he whiche knoweth moſte the courſe of the elemente is not called ſage: but it is he whiche leaſte knoweth the vices of this worlde. For the true Philoſopher profiteth more by not knowynge the euyll, then by learnyng the good. I let thee vnderſtande I am three ſcore and ſeuen yeares olde, and yet neuer before this tyme there reigned Ire in me, but whan thy embaſſage was preſented to me, and that I ſawe layde at my feete ſuche treaſure and ryches. For vppon this deede I gather, that either wyſedome lacketh in thee, or that great couetouſnes aboundeth in me. I doe ſende thee thy golde againe which thou ſendeſt me, and thy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour ſhall declare (as witnes of ſyghte) how greatly it hath ſclaundered all Grece. For it was neuer ſene nor heard of, that in any wyſe they ſhoulde ſuffer golde to enter into the vniuerſitie of <hi>Athens.</hi> For it ſhould not onely be a diſhonour to the philoſophers of Grece to haue ryches: but alſo it woulde turne them to great infamy to deſire them. O king <hi>Creſus,</hi> if thou knoweſt it not, it is but reaſon thou know it, that in the ſcholes of Grece we learne not to commaunde, but to obey: not to ſpeake, but to be ſilent: not to reſiſt, but to humble our ſelues: not to get much, but to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent vs with litle: not to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge offences, but to pardon iniuries: not to take from others, but to giue oure owne: not to be honored, but to trauaile to be vertuous: finally we learne to deſpiſe that which other men loue: and to loue that which other men deſpiſe, which is pouertie. Thou thoughteſt that I would accept thy golde, or els y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I would not. If thou thoughteſt I would haue taken it, then thou haddeſt had reaſon not to haue receiue me afterwardes into thy palace: for it is a great infamy, that the couetous man ſhuld be acceptable to a prince. If thou thoughteſt that I would none of it, thou were not wyſe to take the paynes to ſende it: for princes ought neuer to take vpon them thinges: wherein (as they thinke) the ſubiectes ſhould loſe their honeſtie in receiuing them. See king <hi>Creſus,</hi> and behold that by diligence it litle auaileth to ſerche for the phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; afterwards to do nothing of that which by him is ordeined. I meane that it ſhall not profite, but rather it ſhabe harme, that I come into thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, &amp; that afterwardes thou wilt not doe that whiche I ſhall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine therin, for great daungers enſue to alter the humors with ſiropes: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they take afterwardes a purgation to purge away the ſame. For to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe thy barbarous realme, &amp; to ſatiſfie thy good deſier, I am determined to condiſcende vnto thy requeſt, and to accompliſhe thy commaundement, vpon condition, that thou ſhalt enſure me of theſe thinges folowing. For the labourer ought not to ſowe his ſede, before the ground be plowed &amp; tilled.</p>
                        <p>The firſte, thou ſhalt forſake the euill cuſtome which ye barbarous kings doe vſe, that is to wete, to heape vp treaſures, and not to ſpende them.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:100"/>
For euery prince, whiche is couetous of treaſures, is ſcarſely of capacitie to receiue good counſayle.</p>
                        <p>The ſeconde, thou ſhalt not only baniſhe out of thy place, but alſo out of thy courte all flatterers: for the prince that is a frende of flatterers: of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie muſt be an enemy of the truthe.</p>
                        <p>The thirde, thou ſhalt ende the warres whiche thou (at this preſent) doeſt mainteine againſt the people of <hi>Corinthe:</hi> for euery prince that loueth forayne warres, muſt nedes hate the peace of his common wealth.</p>
                        <p>The fourth, thou ſhalt banniſhe from thy houſe all thoſe Iugglers, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diantes and minſtrels: for the prince which occupieth him ſelfe to heare vaine and trifling thinges, in time of neceſſitie ſhall not applie him ſelfe to thoſe whiche be of weight and importaunce.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, thou ſhalt prouide that all loiterers and vacaboundes be expulſed from thy perſone, and banniſhed thy palace: for idlenes and negligence are cruell enemies of wyſedome.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly, thou ſhalt baniſh from thy court and palace, al liers and ſedicious men: for when liers are ſuffered in the palace of princes, it is a ſigne that the kyng and the realme falleth into vtter deſtruction.</p>
                        <p>The ſeuenth, thou ſhalt promiſe that in al the daies of thy life thou ſhalt not preſſe me to receiue any thing of thee: for the day that thou ſhalt corrupt me with giftes, it is neceſſary that I corrupt thee with euill counſailes. For ther is no counſel that is good, but that whiche procedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the man that is not couetous.</p>
                        <p>If on theſe conditions the king <hi>Creſus</hi> deſireth the philoſopher <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> phi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loſopher <hi>Anacharſis</hi> deſireth the king <hi>Creſus:</hi> &amp; if not, I had rather be a diſciple of ſage philoſophers, then a king of the barbarous people. <hi>Vale felix rex.</hi>

                     <p>IN the laſte yeare of the Latines, and in the firſte yeare of the Romaynes, <hi>Ezechias</hi> beinge kyng of the Iewes, and <hi>Azarias</hi> great Byſſhoppe of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temple, <hi>Abacuck</hi> Prophet in Iewry, and <hi>Merodach</hi> beyng kynge in <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> buylte <hi>Bizaunce</hi> (whiche nowe is <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople) Phalaris</hi> the famous tyraunt was then lyuinge. Of this <hi>Phalaris Ouide</hi> ſaieth, that he was deformed in his face, ſpoore blynde of his eyes, and excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding couetous of riches, and neuer obſerued any thynge that he promyſed.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21411:100"/>
He was vnthankefull to his frendes, and cruell to his ennemies: finally he was ſuch a one, that the tyrannies which ſeuerally were ſcattered in others, in hym alone were altogethers aſſembled. Amongeſt all the iniquities that he inuented, and amongeſt all the tyrannies that he committed, he hadde one vertue very great, whiche was, that euen as he was onely head of all tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: ſo was he chiefe louer and frende of al philoſophers and ſage men. And in all thoſe ſixe and thirty yeares whiche he gouerned the realme by tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they neuer founde that any man touched his bearde, nor that any man ſatte at the table with him, ſpake vnto him, or ſlepte in his bed, nor that any man ſawe in his countenaunce any mirthe, vnleſſe it were ſome philoſopher or ſage man, with whome, and to whom he liberally put his body in truſte. And they ſayde that this <hi>Phalaris</hi> ſaide oftentimes. The prince that abſenteth him ſelfe from ſage men, and accompanieth with fooles: I ſaye vnto him, though he be a prince of his common wealth, he is a cruell tyraunt of his perſon. For it is a greater paine to lyue among fooles, then to die amongeſt ſages. <hi>Pulio</hi> in the ſixte booke <hi>De geſtis Romanorum</hi> ſaieth, that a worthy and excellent painter preſented a table to <hi>Octauian</hi> the Emperour, wherein were drawen all the vertuous princes, and for their chefetaine, <hi>Octauian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroure was drawen: at the foote of this table were all the tyranous Princes paynted, of the whiche <hi>Phalaris</hi> was chiefe and captaine. This table vewed by <hi>Octauian</hi> the Emperour, he commended the worke, but he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalowed the intention thereof, ſaiyng: me thinketh it not mete that I beinge aliue, ſhould be ſet chiefe and princicipall of all the vertuous menne that are deade. For during the time of this wicked lyfe, we are all ſubiecte to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of weake and feble fleſhe. Alſo it ſeameth vnto me an vniuſte thing, that they ſhould put <hi>Phalaris</hi> for principall, and captaine of all the tyrauntes: ſince he was a ſcourge and enemy, to fooles and ignoraunt men: and ſo earneſt a louer and frende of ſages, and wyſe philoſophers. The fame of this cruell tyraunte <hi>Phalaris</hi> beinge knowen, and his extreame cruelties he vſed, ſpred through all Greece.</p>
                     <p>A neighbour and artificer of <hi>Athens</hi> called <hi>Perillus</hi> (a man very excellent in metalles, and a great worker in works of fountaines) came to <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tyraunt, ſaying that he would make ſuche a kinde of torment, that his harte ſhould remayne reuenged, and the offender well puniſhed. The matter was, that this workeman made a bull of braſſe, wherein there was a gate by the whiche they put the offender, and in putting the fier vnder the bul, it roared, and cried, in maner as it had bene aliue: whiche thing was not onely a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and cruell tormente, to the myſerable creature that endured it, but alſo it was terryble to hym or thoſe that ſawe it. Let vs not marueile neyther at the one, nor at the other: for truely the pitefull harte (whiche is not fleſhed in crueltie) hath as muche pitie to ſee an other man ſuffer, as of the ſorrowe and tormente whiche he hym ſelfe feeleth. <hi>Phalaris</hi> therfore ſeing the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this tormente (whereof the inuentour hoped great rewarde) proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the inuentoure of the ſame ſhould be put within the bull, and that the crueltie of the tormente ſhoulde be experimented in none, ſaue onely on the inuentour. Truly in this caſe <hi>Phalaris</hi> ſhewed him ſelf not a cruel tyrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but rather a mercifull Prince, and a ſage Philoſopher: for nothyng can be
<pb facs="tcp:21411:101"/>
more iuſte, then that the inuention of the malice be executed, on the frayle fleſhe of the inuentoure. Nowe becauſe <hi>Phalaris</hi> was a great frende of ſages, the philoſophers of Grece came oftentymes to ſee hym, whiche were verye gently receiued of hym. Though to ſaye the truthe they profited more with his goodes then he did with their phyloſophie. This tyraunte <hi>Phalaris</hi> was not onely a frende of ſages: but alſo he was very well learned, and depelye ſeene in morall philoſophie. The whiche thing appeareth well in the epiſtles, whiche he wrote with his owne hande. I can not tell wherein he ſhewed hym ſelfe greater, either in the ſentences and doctrines whiche he wrote with his penne: or in the ſlaughter and cruelties whiche he did with his ſworde. O howe many companions had <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tyraunt, in this caſe in tymes paſſe: and that (as I woulde) there were none alſo at this time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, whiche in their pleaſaunte wordes did not reſemble the Emperoure <hi>Nero.</hi> I neuer reade other thynge of thoſe that are gone, neyther haue I ſeene otherwyſe of thoſe that are preſent, but many they are that blaſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and infinite whiche runne after vices. For of truth we are very lighte of tongue, and to feble of fleſhe. The Epiſtles whiche this <hi>Phalaris</hi> wrote are knowen to all men, I meane of thoſe which knowe Greke, or laten: and for thoſe that knowe them not, I was wylling to drawe theſe that are preſent, and to put them in our vulgare tongue for twoo cauſes. The one to the ende princes myght ſee howe good a thynge it is to be ſage, and howe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauntes were prayſed for being Sages, and geuing good counſayles. The other, to the ende the people mighte ſee howe eaſie it is to ſpeake well, and howe harde it is to woorke well. For there is nothyng better cheape in the worlde, then counſayle. The ſentences therefore of the Epiſtles of <hi>Phalaris</hi> are theſe whiche followe, in ſuch ſorte as I could moſte briefly gather them, to reduce them in good and profitable ſtile to wryte them.</p>
                     <p>The particuler loue whiche princes ſhew to one more then an other, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth oftentimes muche enuie in their Realmes. For the one being loued, and the other hated, of this commeth hatred, &amp; of hatred co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth euil thoughtes, of euyll thoughtes proceadeth malice, and of malice commeth euyl wordes, the whiche breake out into worſe deedes: Finally when a prince ſheweth not to equalles his fauoure indifferently, he ſetteth fyre in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. Princes ought to forbidde, and Sages ought not to conſente, that rebelles and quarellers ſhould trouble thoſe whiche are quiet and peace makers: for when the people riſe, immediatly couetouſnes is awaked. When couetouſnes groweth, iuſtice falleth, force and violence ruleth, ſnatchynge reigneth, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie is at lybertie, the euyll haue power, and the good are oppreſſed: final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all doe reioyce one to lyue to the preiudice of an other, and euery man to ſeeke his owne priuate commoditie. Many vayne men doe rayſe diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and quarelles amongeſt people, thinking that in troubled water, they ſhoulde augmente their eſtates, who in ſhorte ſpace doe not onely looſe the hope of that they ſought: but alſo are put out of that they poſſeſſed. For it is not onely reaſonable, but alſo moſte iuſte, that thoſe by experience fele that, whiche their blynde malyce wyll not ſuffer them to knowe.</p>
                     <p>It is muche good for the people that the gouernours be not vnfortunate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that of their nature they were happy. For to lucky Prynces, fortune
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21411:101"/>
geueth many thinges euen as they demaunde, yea and geueth them better then they looke for. The noble and valiaunt princes, when they ſee them ſelues with other princes, or that they are preſent in great actes, oughte to ſhewe the freenes of their harte, the greatnes of their realme, the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of their perſone, the loue of their common wealthe, and aboue all the diſcipline of their courte, and the grauitie of their counſayle and palace. For the ſage and curious men ſhoulde not beholde the prince in the apparayle, whiche he weareth: but the men whiche he hath to counſayle him. The ſage men, and thoſe that be not couetous, if they do employe their forces to heape vp treaſures, ought to remember in their hartes how to employ themſelues to ſpende their money well. Sithe fortune is maiſtres in all thinges, and that to her they doe impute both good and euil workes, he alone may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a princely man, who for no contrarietie of fortune is ouercome. For truly that man is of a ſtoute courage, whoſe harte is not vanquiſhed by the force of fortune. Though we prayſe one for valiaunt with the ſworde, we wyll not therefore prayſe him for excellent with the penne. Although he be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with his penne, he is not therefore excellent with his tongue. Though he haue a good tongue, he is not therefore well learned. And thoughe he be learned, he hath not therefore good renowme. And though he hath good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme, he is not therefore of a good lyfe. For we are bounde to receyue the doctrines of many whiche wryte: but we are not bounde to folowe the lyues whiche they doe leade. There is no worſe office amongeſt men, then to take the charge to punyſhe the vices of an other, and therefore men ought to flye from it, as from the peſtylence: for in correctinge vyces, hatred is more ſure to the correctour, then amendement of lyfe is to the offender.</p>
                     <p>He hath and poſſeſſeth muche that hath good frendes: For many ayde their frendes, when they woulde haue holpen them more if they coulde. For the true loue is not weried to loue, nor ceaſeth not to profite. Though ſage men haue loſte muche, they oughte not therefore to diſpayre, but that they ſhall come to it agayne in tyme. For in the ende, tyme doth not ceaſe to doe his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed alterations, nor perfecte frendes ceaſe not to doe that which they oughte. The proude and diſdainefull man (for the moſte parte) alwayes falleth into ſome euill chaunce, therefore it is a commendable medecine ſome tymes to be perſecuted: for aduerſitie maketh a wyſe man lyue more ſafely, and to walke in leſſe daunger. For ſo muche as we doe excuſe hym whiche committeth the faulte, there is neither the offender, nor the offence but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth payne. For ſuche a one that committeth the faulte through ſodayne anger, dyd euyll: and if he dyd committe it by deliberation, he did muche worſe. To deſyre to doe all thynges by reaſon is good, and lykewyſe to laye them all in order is good, but it is very harde: For temperate men haue ſuche reſpecte in compaſſing their doynges, and by weyght ſo caſt all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, that ſcarcely they euer determyne to goe about it. To the man whiche hath gouernement twoo thynges are daungerous, that is to wete, to ſone or to late: But of thoſe twoo, the worſte is to ſone. For if by determining late, a man loſeth that whiche he myght haue gotten: by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining to ſone, that is loſte whiche is nowe gayned, and that whiche a man might haue gayned.</p>

I receyued thy letter here in <hi>Agrigentine,</hi> and though it ſauoured ſomewhat Satirlike, I was not agreued therewith: for of philoſophers and ſages (as thou art) we ſhuld not be greaued with the ſharpe wordes you tell vs, but to conſider the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereupon you ſpeake them. Quarellers and malicious perſons, wyll haue the wordes by weight and meaſure, but the vertuous and pacient me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doe not regarde but the intentions. For if we ſhould goe about to examine euery worde they ſpeake vnto vs: we ſhould geue our ſelues to much paine, and we ſhould alwaies ſet in the common wealth debate. I am a tyraunt, &amp; as yet am in tyrannie: but I ſweare vnto the immortall gods, whether the worde were good, or bad, I neuer altered it. For if a good man tell it me, I take it for my paſtime. Thou wryteſt vnto me that all Grece is offended with me there: but I let them vnderſtande that all <hi>Agrigentine</hi> is all edified with thee here. And thereof thou maiſte praiſe me. For if the tyrauntes were not ſo muche diſpraiſed, the philoſophers ſhould not be ſo well loued. Thou art counted for good, &amp; art good: and I am counted for euill, and am euyll. But in mine opinion thou ſhouldeſt not be proud for the one, neither I ſhuld diſpeire for the other. For the day of the life is long, and therein fortune doth many thinges, &amp; it may wel be, that from a tyraunt I ſhalbe a philoſopher: &amp; thou from a philoſopher ſhalt be a tyraunt. Se my frend, that the long tyme maketh oftentimes the earth to be turned to ſiluer: &amp; the ſiluer &amp; gold becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth nothing worth. I meane, that there neuer was a tyrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in any realme, but that firſt he had bene brought vp in the ſtudies of Grece. I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that all the renowmed tyrauntes haue not bene nouriſhed in <hi>Scicile:</hi> but alſo thou ſhalt not deny me, that they were not borne in Grece. Therfore ſee and beholde to whom the fault is: from the mother whiche bare them, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the nurſe which gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuck. I do not ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhalbe, but I ſay that it may wel be, that if I were there in Grece, I ſhould be a better philoſopher than thou: &amp; if thou were here in <hi>Agrigentine,</hi> thou wouldeſt be a worſer tyraunt tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I. I would thou ſhouldeſt thinke, that thou mighteſt be better in Grece where thou art: and that I might be worſe in <hi>Agrigentine</hi> where I am.</p>

The conning man <hi>Perillus</hi> came into theſe partes and hath made a Bul, wherin he hath put a kind of torment, the moſt feare fulleſt in the world: and truly I cauſed, that that which his malyce had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, ſhould be of none other than of himſelfe experimented.

                     <p>IF <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> deceiue me not, the great <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſonne to kyng Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyppe of <hi>Macedome,</hi> dyd not deſerue to be called great, for that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with thouſands of men of warre: but he wanne the renowne of great, for that he had more philoſophers on his counſaile then all other princes had. This great prince neuer toke vpon him warres, but that firſte the order of executyng the ſame ſhoulde before his preſence be examyned of the ſages, and wiſe philoſophers. And truly he had reaſon. For in affaires, wher good counſaile haue proceded, they may alwayes loke for a good end. Theſe Hiſtoriographers whych wrote of great <hi>Alexander</hi> (as wel the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as the <hi>Latines</hi>) knowe not whether the fierſnes wherwith he ſtroke his enemyes was greater, or the humanitie wherewith he embraced his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle. Though the ſage philoſophers whych accompanied the great <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> were many in nombre: yet notwithſtandyng amongeſt all thoſe, <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Anaxarcus,</hi> and <hi>Onoſichrates</hi> were his moſt familiars, And herein <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhewed hymſelfe very wiſe. For wiſe princes ought to take the counſaile of many, but they ought to determine and conclude vpon the opinion of few. The greate <hi>Alexander</hi> did not contente himſelfe, to haue ſages with hym, neyther to ſende onlye to deſire thoſe whiche were not his: but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes himſelfe in perſonne woulde goo ſee theym, vyſite theym, and counſayle with theym. Saying that the Princes whiche are the ſeruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of ſages, come to be made maiſters and Lordes ouer all.</p>
                     <p>In the time of <hi>Alexander Magnus, Diogenes</hi> the philoſopher lyued, who neither for entreatye, nor yet for any promiſes made, would come to ſee <hi>Alexander</hi> the great. Wherfore the great <hi>Alexander</hi> went to ſe him, and when he had deſired him to go with him, and acompany him, <hi>Diogenes</hi> aunſwered.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſince thou wilte winne honoure in keapinge of menne in thy companye: it is not reaſon that I ſhoulde looſe it, to forſake my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: For in folowing the, I ſhall not folow my ſelfe: and being thyne, I ſhal ceaſe to be myne.</p>
                     <p>Thou arte come to haue the name of the greate <hi>ALEXANDER,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:103"/>
for conqueringe the worlde, and I haue attayned to come to renowme of a good Phyloſopher in flyeng the world. And if thou doſt ymagine that thou haſt gotten, and wonne: I thinke that I haue not erred, nor loſt, And ſince thou wilt be no leſſe in aucthoritye then a king, do not thinke that I wil loſe the eſtimacion of a philoſopher. For in the world there is no greater loſſe vnto a man, then when he looſeth his proper lybertie. When hee had ſpoken theſe wordes, <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaid vnto them that were about him with a loude voyce. By the immortall gods I ſweare, and as god <hi>Mars</hi> rule my handes in battaile, if I were not <hi>Alexander</hi> the greate, I would be <hi>Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> the Philoſopher. And he ſayd further, in myne opinion there is no other felycitie vpon the earth, then to be <hi>Alexander</hi> king, who commaundeth al, or to be <hi>Diogenes</hi> to commaund <hi>Alexander,</hi> who commaundeth all. As king <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> was more familyar with ſome philoſophers, then with others: ſo he eſtemed ſome bookes more then others. And they ſay he read oftentimes in the Iliades of <hi>Homere,</hi> which is a booke where the ſtorye of the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Troy</hi> is: and that when he ſlept, he layde vnder his head vpon a bolſter his ſword, and alſo his booke. When the great king <hi>Alexander</hi> was borne, his father King of <hi>Macedonie</hi> did two notable things. The one was, that he ſent many and very riche giftes into the Ile of <hi>Delphos,</hi> wher the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> was, to the end to preſent theym with him, and to praye him, that it would pleaſe him to preſerue his ſonne. The other thing that he did was, that immediatly he wrote a letter to the greate Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotel,</hi> wher in he ſayd theſe words.</p>

                           <hi>PHilippe</hi> king of <hi>Macedonie,</hi> wiſheth healthe and peace, to the Philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotel,</hi> which readeth in the vniuerſitie of Grece. I let the vnderſtand, that <hi>Olimpias</hi> my wife is brought to bedde of a goodly man child, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of both ſhe and I, and all <hi>Macedonie</hi> do reioyce. For kinges &amp; realmes ought to haue great ioy, when there is borne any ſonne ſucceſſour of the naturall prince of the prouince. I render thankes vnto the immortall gods, &amp; haue ſent many great giftes to the Temples, and it was not ſo much for that I haue a ſonne, as for that they haue giuen him vnto me, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of ſo great and excellent philoſopher. I hope that thou wilt bringe him vp, and teache him in ſuch ſort, that by heritage he ſhalbe Lord of my patrimonye of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donie,</hi> and by deſert he ſhalbe lorde of all <hi>Aſia:</hi> ſo that they ſhould call him my ſonne, and the his father. <hi>Vale foelix, iterumque vale. Ptolomeus</hi> father in lawe, who was the viii. kinge of the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> did greatly loue the ſages as wel of <hi>Caldea,</hi> as of Grece, and this thinge was eſtemed for a great vertue in king <hi>Ptolome.</hi> For there was aſmuch enuy betwene the Philoſophers of Greece, and the ſages of <hi>Egipt:</hi> as betwene the captaines of Rome, and the captaines of <hi>Carthage.</hi> This <hi>Ptolome</hi> was very wiſe, and did deſire greatly to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pained with philoſophers: and after this he learned the letters of the <hi>Laty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Caldes,</hi> and <hi>Hebrues,</hi> For the which cauſe, though the kinges named <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomei</hi> were .11. in nombre, and all warrelyke men: yet they put this for the chiefe, and captaine of all, not for the battayles which he wanne, but for the ſentences which he learned. This king <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> had for his famyliar, a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher called <hi>Eſtilpho Megarenſe,</hi> who was ſo entierlye beloued of this prince
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21411:103"/>
that (laying aſide the gentlenes and benifites which he ſhewed him) he dyd not only eate with the king at his table: but oftentimes the king made him drincke of his owne cuppe. And as the fauours which princes ſhew to their ſeruauntes, are but as a watche to proue the malycious: it chaunſed, that when this king gaue the phyloſopher to drincke that whyche remayned in his cuppe, an <hi>Egiptian</hi> knight moued with enuye, ſayd vnto king <hi>Ptolome.</hi> I thinke Lord how that thou art neuer ſatiſfyed with drinking, to leaue that whiche remayneth in the cuppe, for the philoſopher to drinke after the. To whom the king aunſwered. Thou ſayſt wel, that the phyloſopher <hi>Eſtilpho</hi> is neuer fylled with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I do giue him. For that which remayneth in my cuppe, doth not profite him ſo much to drinke: as the phyloſophye which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth in hym ſhould profite the, if thou wouldeſt take it. The king <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> was one of the moſte renowmed ſeruauntes, that kinge <hi>Alexander</hi> the great euer had, who after his death enherited a great part of his empire. For how much happie the king <hi>Alexander</hi> was in his lyfe, ſo much he was vnhappie at the tyme of his death: becauſe he had no children whych might enherite his goodes, and that he had ſuch ſeruauntes as ſpoyled him of his renowme. This king <hi>Antigonus</hi> was an vnthrift, and exceſſiue in all vyces: But for all that he loued greatly the Phyloſophers, which thing remayned vnto him from kinge <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe palace was a ſcoole of all the good Phyloſophers of the world. Of this enſample they may ſe what great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite enſueth, of bringing vp of them that be yonge, for there is none that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was ſo wicked or enclyned vnto euyl: but that in longe contynuannce may profyte ſomewhat in his youth. This kyng <hi>Antigonus</hi> loued ii. philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers greatly, the which floriſhed in that tyme, that is to wete <hi>Amenedius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Abio,</hi> of which ii. <hi>Abio</hi> was wel learned, &amp; very poore. For in that time no phy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loſopher durſt openly read phyloſophy, if he were worth any thing in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall goodes. As <hi>Laertius</hi> ſayth, and as <hi>Pulio</hi> declareth it better, in the booke of the rulers and noble men of the Greekes. The ſcholes of the vniuerſytie were ſo correct, that the Phyloſopher whych knew moſt, had leaſt goodes: ſo that they did not glorifie of any thing els: but to haue pouertye, and to know much of philoſophy. The caſe was ſuch, that the philoſopher <hi>Abio</hi> was ſicke, and with that ſicknes he was ſo vexed, that they might almoſt ſee the bones of his weake body. The king <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to viſite him by his owne ſonne, by whom he ſent hym much money to he helpe him wyth all. For he lyued in extreame pouerty, as it behoued the profeſſours of Philoſophy. <hi>Abio</hi> was ſore ſicke, being aged, and croked, and though he had made himſelfe ſo leaue with ſicknes: yet notwithſtanding he burned always vpon the weeke of good life. I meane that he had no leſſe courage to diſpiſe thoſe giftes: then the kinge <hi>Antigonus</hi> had nobles to ſend them. This Philoſopher not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue deſpiſed theſe giftes in ſuch ſort, ſaid vnto the ſonne of <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> who brought theym. Tell king <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that I giue him great than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, for the good enterteinment he gaue me always in my life, and for the giftes he ſendeth me now at my death.</p>
                        <p>For one frende can doo no more to an other, thanne to offer him hys parſonne, and to departe withe his proper goodes. And tell the kynge thy father, that I maruayle what he ſhoulde meane, that I nowe beinge

foure ſcore yeres of age, &amp; haue walked al my lyfe time naked in this world, ſhould now be laden with veſtures &amp; money, ſince I muſt paſſe ſo ſtreight a goulfe in the ſea, to goe out of this world. The Egiptians haue a cuſtome to lighten the burden of their camels, when they paſſe the deſertes of <hi>Arabia</hi> which is much better then to ouercharge them. I meane, that he only paſſeth without trauayle the daungers of the lyfe, which banniſheth from him the thought of temperal goods of this world. Thirdly thou ſhalt ſay to the king thy father, that from henceforth when any man will dye, he do not ſuccour nor healpe him with money, gold, nor riches, but with good and ripe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle. For gold wil make him leaue his lyfe with ſorow, and good counſail-will moue him to take his death with pacience. The fift king of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> was called <hi>Archelaus,</hi> who they ſay to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grandfather of kinge <hi>Philip,</hi> father of the great <hi>Alexander.</hi> This kinge boſteth himſelfe to deſcend from <hi>Menelaus,</hi> king of the Grecians, and principall captaine which was at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> This kyng <hi>Archelaus</hi> was a great frend to the ſages and amongeſt others there was a <hi>Poete</hi> with him called <hi>Euripides,</hi> who at that tyme had no leſſe glory in his kind of <hi>Poetrie:</hi> then <hi>Archelaus</hi> in his kingdome being kyng of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> For now a days, we eſteme more the ſages for the bookes which they wrote: then we do exalt kynges for the realmes which they ruled, or the battayles whych they ouercome. The familiarity whych <hi>Euripides</hi> had wyth the kyng <hi>Archelaus</hi> was ſo ſtreight, and his credite wyth <hi>Archelaus</hi> was ſo great, that in the Realme of <hi>Macedonie</hi> nothyng was done, but firſt it was examined by the hands of this phyloſopher. And as the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ignoraunt would not naturally be ſubiecte to the ſage: it chaunſed that one nyght <hi>Euripides</hi> was talkyng a long time wyth the kyng, declaring vnto hym the auncient hyſtoryes, and when the poore Poete would depart to go home to his houſe, hys enemyes eſpyed him, and let hungrye dogges fly vpon hym: the whych dyd not only teare hym in peces, but eate hym e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery morſell. So that the intraylles of the dogges, were the wofull graue of the myſerable poete, The king <hi>Archilaus</hi> being certifyed of this woful caſe, immedyatly (as ſone as they told hym) was ſo chafed, that almoſt he was bereft of hys ſences. And here at merueile not at al. For gentle hartes do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter greatly, when they are aduertyſed of any ſodayne myſhappe. As the loue whych the kyng had to <hi>Euripides</hi> in hys lyfe was much, ſo lykewyſe the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row whych he felte at hys death was very great. For he ſhed many teares from hys eyes, he cut the heares of hys head, he rounded his beard, he chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the apparayle whych he weare, and aboue all, he made as ſolempne a funeral to <hi>Euripides,</hi> as if they had buried <hi>Vliſſes.</hi> And not contented wythal theſe thyngs he was neuer mery, vntil ſuch tyme he had done cruel execucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the malefactours, For truly the iniury or death whych is done vnto him whom we loue: is no other but as a bath and token of our owne good wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. After iuſtice was executed of thoſe homycides, and that ſome of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (all gnawen of the dogges) were buryed, a Grecian knight ſayd vnto kyng <hi>Archelaus.</hi> I let the know excellent kyng, that all <hi>Macedonia</hi> is offended with the, becauſe that for ſo ſmall a loſſe thou haſte ſhewed ſo greate ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. To whom kynge <hi>Archelaus</hi> aunſwered. Among ſages it is a thinge ſufficientlye tried, that noble hartes oughte not to ſhewe theymſelues

ſadde, for miſhappes and ſodaine chaunces: For the king being ſadde his realme can not (and though it might, it ought not) ſhew it ſelfe mery. I haue heard my father ſay once, that princes ſhould neuer ſhedde teares, vnleſſe it were for one of theſe cauſes.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The firſt, the Prince ſhould bewaile the loſſe and daunger of his common wealth: for the good Prince ought to pardon the iniuryes done to his par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon: but to reuenge the leaſt act done to the common wealth, he ought to haſarde himſelfe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The ſecond, the good prince ought to lamente if any man haue touched his honour in any wiſe: for the Prince which wepeth not droppes of bloud for the thinges touchinge hys honoure, deſerueth to be buryed quycke in his graue.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The third, the good Prynce ought to bewayle thoſe whych can lytle, and ſuffer muche: For the Prynce whych bewayleth not the calamities of the poore, in vaine and without profite lyueth on the earth.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 The fourth, the good Prince ought to bewayle the glory and proſperity wherin the Tiraunts are: For that prince whych wyth tyrannye of the euil is not diſpleaſed, wyth the hartes of the good is vnworthye to be beloued.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 The fift, the good Prynce ought to bewayle the death of wiſe men: For to a Prynce there can come no greater loſſe, then when a wyſe man dyeth in his common wealth.</p>
                        <p>Theſe were the words, which the king <hi>Archelaus</hi> aunſwered the Grecian knight, who reproued him becauſe he had wept for the death of <hi>Euripides</hi> the phyloſopher. The auncient Hiſtoriographers can ſay no more, of the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon whych the Phyloſophers and wyſe men had, as well the <hi>Greekes</hi> as the <hi>Latynes:</hi> but I wyl tell you one thinge worthy of noting. It is wel knowen through all the world, that <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Ethnicke,</hi> was one of the worthyeſte that euer was in Rome: for by hys name, and by hys occaſion, Rome gotte ſuch a memorye as ſhall euermore endure. And this was not only for that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quered <hi>Affrycke,</hi> but for the great worthynes of hys perſon. Men ought not to eſteme a lytle theſe two giftes in one man, that is to wete, to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, and aduentures: For many of the auncientes in times paſt wanne glory by their ſwords, &amp; after loſt it by their euil liues. The Romaynes hiſtorogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay, that the firſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wrote in heroical meeter in the Latin tongue, was <hi>Ennius</hi> the poete, the workes of whom was ſo eſtemed of <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Ethnicke,</hi> that when this aduenturous &amp; ſo lucky Romaine dyed, he commaunded in hys wil and teſtament, that they ſhould hange the image of thys <hi>Ennius</hi> the Poet ouer his graue. By that the great <hi>Scipio</hi> did at his death, we may wel coniecture how great a frend he was of ſages in his life: ſince he had rather for his honor, ſet the ſtatue of <hi>Ennius</hi> on his graue: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the banner wherwith he wanne and conquered <hi>Affricke.</hi> In the time of <hi>Pirrus</hi> (which was king of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> &amp; great enemy of the Romaines) floriſhed a philoſopher named <hi>Cinas,</hi> borne in <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> who (as they ſay) was the diſciple of <hi>Demoſthenes.</hi> The hiſtoriographers at that time did ſo much eſteme this <hi>Cinas,</hi> that they ſayd he was the maiſter &amp; meaſure of mans eloquence. For he was very pleaſaunt in words, &amp; profound in ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tences. This <hi>Cinas</hi> ſerued for 3. offices in the palace of king <hi>Pyrrus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <pb facs="tcp:21411:105"/>1 Firſt he made paſtime at his table in that he dyd declare: for he had a good grace in thinges of laughter.</p>

Ther is at this day no Lion ſo fierce, no Serpent ſo venimous, no Viper ſo infectiue, no Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picke ſo mortall, neyther any beaſt ſo tirrible, but at the leaſt both male &amp; female do once in the yere mete &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne: and thoughe that in brute beaſtes there lacketh reaſon, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtandynge they haue a naturall inſtinction to aſſemble themſelues for the conſeruacion of their kinde. In this caſe men deſerue no leſſe reproche then beaſtes merite prayſe: for after that the females by generacion are bigge, they neuer agre that the males ſhould accompany with theym. Accordinge to the diuerſitye of nacions, ſo amonge themſelues they differ the one from the other, in lawes, languages, ceremonyes, and cuſtomes: but in the ende all agre in one thinge, for that they inforce themſelues to celebrate mariage. As the ſcriptures teacheth vs, Since the worlde was created, there hath nothyng bene more auncient, then the ſacrament of mariage: for that daye that man was formed, the ſelfe ſame day he celebrated mariage with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the tereſtrial paradiſe. The auncient hiſtoriographers (aſwell Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes as latins) wrote many great thinges in the prayſe of mariage: but they could not ſay nor write ſo much, as continuall experience doth ſhew vs. Therfore leauing the ſuperfluous, and taking the moſt neceſſary, we ſaye that fyue commodyties folow the ſage man, who hath taken the yoke of matrimonye.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, the memory whych remayneth to the children as ſucceſſours and heires of their fathers. For as the phyloſopher <hi>Pithagoras</hi> ſayth, when a father paſſeth out of this preſent lyfe, and leaueth behind him a child being hys heire, they cannot ſay vnto him that he dieth, but that he waxeth yonge in his chyld, ſince the chyld dooth inherite the fleſhe, the goodes, and the memorye of the father. Amonge the auncientes it was a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, that the taſte of all taſtes is bread, the ſauor of ſauours is ſalte, and the greateſt loue of al loues is from the fathers to the children. And though
<pb facs="tcp:21411:106"/>
perchaunce we ſee the fathers ſhew ſome rigor to their children, we ought not therfore to ſay that they hate them, and diſpiſe them: for the tender loue of the father to the ſonne is ſuch, that he cannot endure him to do any thing amyſſe, or worthye of rebuke. Not only men of reaſon and brute beaſtes, but alſo the hedge and gardeine trees, to their poſſibylitye procure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewe their kind: and it is plainly ſene, in that before the fruites and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes were formed to be eaten, the ſeades and kirnelles were made to be kept. Men naturally deſire honour in their lyfe, and memory after their death. Therfore I ſay, that they come to honour by highe, and noble, and heroical fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>es, but the memorye is left by the good and legittimate children: for the chyldren which are borne in adultery, are begotten in ſinne, and with great care are nouriſhed.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond benefite of mariage is, that they avoide adultery, and it is no ſmal matter to auoide this vyce. For the adulterers are not only taken in the chriſtian relygion for offendours: but alſo amongeſt the gentyles they are counted infamous.</p>
                     <p>The ſage <hi>Solon</hi> in the lawes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he gaue to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> comaunded vpon ſtraighte preceptes that they ſhould mary, to auoide adulterye, vpon paine that the chyld that ſhould be borne in adulterye, ſhould be made the comon ſlaue of the city. The Romaynes (as men foreſeinge all things) ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the tables of their lawes, that the children which were borne in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, ſhould not be heires of the goodes of their fathers. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oratoure <hi>Eſchines</hi> was banniſhed out of <hi>Athens,</hi> as he came by the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> he toke no ſuch paines in any one thing as he did in perſwadyng the <hi>Rhodians</hi> to mary and not to liue in adultery: for amonge thoſe barbarous, matrimonye was not common, but only amonge them which were officers of the common wealth. <hi>Cicero</hi> in a famylyer epyſtell ſayth, that the great Romayne <hi>Marcus Porcio</hi> being gouernour in the common wealth, neuer agred that an vncle of his ſhold be maiſter of the Romaine cheualry, vnleſſe he were maried: which office was promyſed him by the ſenate. His name was <hi>Rufus,</hi> a ſtout and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyaunt man in warre: this notwithſtandyng <hi>Marcus Porcio</hi> ſayde, that that praiſe which <hi>Rufus</hi> deſerued for being valyaunt and hardy: he loſt againe for lyuing in adultery. And that he would neuer graunt his voyce, nor be in place where they commytted any charge in the warres, to a man that had not a lawfull wife. I ſay therfore, that if the gentyles and infidels eſtemed mariage ſo much, &amp; dyſpiſed the dedes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> adulterers ſo greatly: much more Chriſtians ſhould be in this caſe ware &amp; circumſpect. For the gentiles feared nothing but only infamy: but the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ought to feare both infamy &amp; alſo paine. Since that of neceſſity mans ſede muſt increaſe and that we ſe men ſuffer theym ſelues to be ouercome wyth the fleſhe: it weare muche better they ſhould maintaine a houſehoulde, and lyue vprightly wyth a wife: then to waſt their goodes, and burden their conſcyence with a concubyne. For it is oft tymes ſeene, that that whiche a gentleman conſumeth abrode vppon an harlotte wythe ſhame, woulde keape his wyfe and chyldren at home with honeſty.</p>
                     <p>The third commodytie of mariage is, the laudable and louing company,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21411:106"/>
the which is, or ought to be betwene them that are maryed. The auncient Philoſophers defining what man was, ſayde, that he was a creature, the whych by nature was ſociable, communycable, and riſyble, wherof it folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth, that the man being ſolitarye and cloſe in his condicions, can not be in his ſtomacke but enuyous. We that are men loue the good inclinacion, and do alſo commend the ſame in beaſtes: for all that the ſedicious man and the reſtye horſe eate, we thinke it euyl ſpent. A ſad man, a ſole man, a man ſhut in, and ſolytary, what profite can he do to the people? for if euery man ſhould be locked vp in his houſe, the common wealth ſhould forthwith periſh. My intencion is to ſpeake againſt the vacabondes, which without taking vpon them any craft or facultie, paſſe the age of forty, or fifty yeares, and woulde not, nor wil not marie yet, becauſe they woulde be vicious all the dayes of their lyfe. It is a great ſhame and conſcyence to many men, that neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine with them ſelues to take vpon them any eſtate, neyther to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, chaſt, ſecular, or eccleſiaſtiall: but as the corke vppon the water they ſwyme, whether their ſenſualytie leadeth them. One of the moſt lawdable &amp; holy compagnyes which is in this lyfe, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> compagny of the man &amp; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ineſpeciallye if the woman be vertuous: for the noble and vertuous wife, withdraweth al the ſorowes from the hart of her huſband, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſheth his deſires, wherby he lyueth at reſt. When the wyfe is vertuous, &amp; the huſband wiſe, we ought to beleue that betwene them two is the true loue: for the one not being ſuſpect with the other, and hauing children in the myddeſt, it is vnpoſſible but that they ſhould lyue in concord. For al that I haue red and ſene I would ſay, that if the man and the wife do lyue quyet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly together, a man may not only cal them good maried folkes, but alſo holy perſonnes: for to ſpeake the truth, the yoke of matrimony is ſo great, that it cannot be accompliſhed without much merite. The contrary ought and may be ſaied of thoſe whych are euill maried, whom we wil not cal a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigny of ſayntes, but rather a houſe of deuylles. For the wife that hath an euil huſbande, may ſay ſhe hath a deuyl in her houſe: and the huſband that hath an euil wife, let him make accompt that he hath hel it ſelfe in his houſe. For the euyl wyues are worſe then the infernal furyes. Becauſe in hel ther are none tormented but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euil only: but the euil woman torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth, both the good, and the euyl. Concluding therfore this matter, I ſay alſo and affirme, that betwixt the buſband and the wife which are wel maryed, is the true and very loue: and they only, and no others, may be called perfite and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall frendes. The other parentes and frendes, if they do loue and praiſe vs in our preſence, they hate vs and diſpiſe vs in our abſence. Yf they giue vs faire wordes, they beare vs euill hartes: finally they loue vs in our proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, and forſake vs in our aduerſity: but it is not ſo amongeſt the noble and vertuous maried perſonnes. For they loue both within and without the houſe, in proſperity, and in aduerſitie, in pouertie, and in riches, in abſence, and in preſence, ſeing them ſelues mery, and perceiuing them ſelues ſad, and if they do it not, trulye they ought to doo it: for when the huſband is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his foote, the wyfe ought to be greued at her hart.</p>
                     <p>The fourth commodity of mariage is, that the men and women maryed haue more aucthority and grauity then the others. The lawes whych were
<pb facs="tcp:21411:107"/>
made in old time in the fauour of mariage, were many and diuerſe. For <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharoneus,</hi> in the lawes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he gaue to the Egiptians, commaunded and ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon greuous paynes, that the man that was not maried, ſhould not haue any office of gouernment in the common wealth. And he ſayd furder, that he that hath not learned to gouerne his houſe, can euil gouerne a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth. Accordyng to the lawes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he gaue to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> he perſwaded al thoſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comon wealth to marie themſelues voluntarily: but to the hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and captaines, which gouerne the affaires of warre, he commaunded to marye of neceſſity, ſayeng that to men which are lecherous, God ſeldome giueth victories <hi>Licurgus</hi> the renowmed gouernour and geuer of the lawes of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> commaunded, that al captaines of the armyes, and the prieſtes of the Temples ſhould be maried: ſayeng that the ſacrifyces of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried men were more acceptable to the gods, then thoſe of any other. As <hi>Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> ſayth, in an epiſtle that he ſent to <hi>Falconius</hi> his frende, rebuking him for that he was not maried, where he declareth that the Romaynes in old time had a law, that the dictatoure, and the Pretor, the Cenſour, and the Queſtor, and al the knightes ſhould of neceſſity be maried: for the man that hath not a wife and children legittymate in his houſe, cannot haue nor hold greate aucthority in the common wealth. <hi>Plutarche,</hi> in the booke that he made of the prayſe of mariage ſayth, that the prieſtes of the Romaynes dyd not agre to them that were vnmaried, to come and ſytte downe in the Temples: ſo that the yong maydens prayed without at the church dore, and the yonge men prayed on their knees in the temple, only the maried men were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſitte or ſtande. <hi>Plynie</hi> in an epiſtle that he wrote to <hi>Fabatus</hi> hys father in law ſayth, that the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had a cuſtome, that he neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any yonge man in his preſence to ſitte, nor permitted any man maried to tel his tale on foote. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the booke that he made in the prayſe of women ſayth, that ſince the realme of <hi>Corinthe</hi> was peopled more with Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelours, then with maried men: they ordeyned amongeſt theym, that the man or woman that had not bene maried and alſo that had not kept chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and houſe, (if they lyued after a certaine age) after their death ſhoulde not be buried.</p>

                     <p>BY the ſundry examples that we haue declared, and by al that whych re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth to declare, a man may know wel enoughe of what excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy matrimony is, not only for the charge of conſcience, but alſo for the thinges touching honour: for to ſay the truth, the men that in the common wealth are maried, giue ſmal occaſion to be ſclaundered, &amp; haue more cauſe to be honored. We cannot denay, but that matrimony is troubleſome &amp; char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be maried for two cauſes.

                        </gap>e we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny, but that the good &amp; vertuous wife is ſhe that ſetteth a ſtay in the houſe, and kepeth her huſband in eſtimacion in the common wealth: for in the publike affaires, they giue more faith and credit vnto thoſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21411:107"/>
that are charged with children, then vnto others that are loden with yeres.</p>
                     <p>The fifth commodity that enſueth matrimony, is the peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliacions that are made betwene the enemyes, by meanes of mariage. Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this age are ſo couetous, ſo importune, and malicious, that there are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few but haue enemyes, wherby groweth contencion and debate: for by our weaknes, we fall dayly into a thouſande occaſions of enimities: and ſcarcely we can find one to bring vs againe into frendſhip, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering what men deſire, what thinges they procure, and wherunto they aſpire. I mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile not that they haue ſo few frendes: but I much muſe that they haue no moe enemyes. For in thinges of weight, they marke not who haue bene their frendes, they conſider not they are their neighbours, neyther they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that they are chriſtians: but their conſcience layd a part, and honeſty ſet a ſide, euery man ſeketh for himſelfe, and his owne affaires, though it be to the preiudice of all his neighbours. What frendſhip can ther be amongeſt proud men, ſince the one wil go before, and the other diſdayneth to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind? What frendſhip can ther be amongeſt enuyous men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince the one pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſſeth, and the other poſſeſſeth? what loue can there be betwene two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous men, ſince the one dare not ſpend, and the other is neuer ſatiſfyed to hourd, and heape vp. For al that we can reade, ſe, go, and trauaile, and for al that we may do, we ſhall neuer ſe nor here tell of men that haue lacked ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes: for eyther they be vycious, or vertuous. Yf they be euil and vycious, they are alwayes hated of the good: and if they be good and vertuous, they are continually perſecuted of the euill. Many of the auncient philoſophers ſpent a great part of their time, &amp; loſt much of their goodes, to ſerche for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies and meanes to reconcile them that were at debate, &amp; contencion, &amp; to make them by gentlenes good frends and louers. Some ſaid that it was good and profitable, to forget the enimities for a time: for many things are pardoned in tyme, which by reaſon could neuer take end. Others ſayd that for to appeaſe the enemyes, it was good to offer money, becauſe moneye doth not only breake the feminate and tender hartes, but alſo the hard and craggy rockes. Others ſaied that the beſt remedie was, to ſet good men to be mediatours betwene them, in eſpecially if they were ſage and wiſe men: for the honeſt faces &amp; ſtout hartes are aſhamed when they are proferred mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the good do humble them ſelues by intreaty. Theſe meanes well conſidered, and the remydies wel ſoughte out to make frendes, there are none ſo ready, &amp; ſo true as mariage: for the mariage done ſacramentally is of ſuch &amp; ſo great excellency, that betwene ſome it cauſeth perfite frendſhip, &amp; betwene others it appeaſeth great iniuries. During the time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> kept him ſelfe as father in law to the great <hi>Pompeius,</hi> &amp; that <hi>Pompeius</hi> helde himſelfe his ſonne in law, ther was neuer euil wil nor quarels betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but after that <hi>Pompeius</hi> was deuorced from the houſe of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> hatred, enuy, &amp; enimities engendered betwene them: in ſuch ſort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they contended in ſuche &amp; ſo cruell warres, that <hi>Pompeius</hi> againſt his wil loſt his head, &amp; alſo <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> ſhortned his life. When thoſe that dwelled in Rome rauiſhed &amp; robbed the doughters of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Sabines,</hi> if after they had not chaunged their counſel, &amp; of theues to become huſbandes, without doubt the Romaines had bene all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: for the <hi>Sabines</hi> had made an othe to aduenture both their goodes and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:108"/>
their lyues, for to reueng the iniuries done vnto them, their doughters, and wiues: but by the meanes of mariage, they were conferred in great amity and loue. For the Romaines receued in mariage the doughters of the <hi>Sabines</hi> whom before they had rauiſhed. Greater enimity ther ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be, then that of god towards men, through the ſinne of <hi>Adam:</hi> notwithſtanding ther neuer was, nor neuer ſhalbe greater frendſhip then that, which was made by the godly maryage: and for greater aucthority to confirme mariage, the ſonne of god woulde that his mother ſhould be maried, and afterward he himſelfe was preſent at a mariage, where he turned the water into wine, though now a days the euil maried men do turne the wine into water. He doth not ſpeake here of religious perſonnes, nor men of the Church, neither of thoſe which are cloſed in deuout places: for thoſe (fleing the occaſions of the world, and choſing the wayes leſſe daungerous) haue offered their ſoules to god, &amp; with their bodyes haue done him acceptable ſacrifices: For ther is difference betwene the relygion of Chriſt, and the ſinfull Sinagoge of the Iewes: for they offered kyddes and muttons, but here are not offered but teares and ſighes. Leauyng therfore all thoſe ſecretes apart, which men ought to leaue to God: I ſay and affirme, that it is a holy and commendable counſel, to vſe his profite with the Sacrament of mariage: the which though it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of al voluntaryly, yet Princes &amp; great lordes ought to take it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. For the prynce that hath no wife nor chyldren ſhal haue in his realme, much grudgyng and diſpleaſure. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the booke he made of mariage ſayth, that amongeſt the <hi>Lidiens</hi> ther was a law wel obſerued and kept, that of neceſſity their kings and gouernours ſhould be maried: &amp; they had ſuch reſpect to this thing, and were ſo circumſpect in this matter, that if a prince dyed and left his heire an infant, they would not ſuffer him to gouerne the realme vntil he were maried. And they greatly lamented the day of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting of their Quene out of this lyfe: for with her death, the gouermente ceaſed, the royal aucthorytie remained voyd, and the common wealth with out gouernment, ſo long tyme as the king deferred to take another wyfe: &amp; ſo they were ſome times, without kyng, or gouernment. For princes are, or ought to be, the mirrour and example of al, to lyue honeſt, and temperate, the which cannot welbe done vnleſſe they be maried, or that they ſe themſelues to be conquerers of the fleſh, &amp; being ſo they are ſatiſfyed: but if they be not maried and the fleſh doth aſſault them, then they lyue immedyatly conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Wherfore of neceſſity they muſt go by their neighbours houſes, or els by ſome other diſhoneſt places ſcattered abrode, to the reproch and dyſhonour of them and their kindredes: and oftentymes to the great peryl and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their parſonnes.</p>

                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:21411:108"/>The auncientes neuer diſagreed one from another, in the approbation and acception of mariage: but ther was amongeſt them great difference, &amp; ſtrife, vpon the contractes, ceremonies, and vſages of the ſame. For they vſed as muche difference in contractinge matrimony, and choſinge their wyues: as theſe Epicures doe deſire, the varietie of ſundry delicate meates. The deuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his booke he made of the common wealth, did councel that al things ſhould be common, and that not onely in brute beaſtes, in mouables, and heritages, but alſo that women ſhould be commen: for he ſaide, that if theſe twoo wordes, thine, and mine, were aboliſſhed and out of vſe, there ſhoulde not be debates, nor quarelles in this worlde. They call <hi>Plato</hi> deuine, for many good thinges whiche he ſpake: but nowe they may call him worldly, for the councell profane whiche he gaue. I can not tell what beaſte lines it may be called, nor what greater rewdenes may be thought, that the apparrell ſhuld be proper, and the wyues commen. The brute beaſte doth not knowe that whiche came out of her belly, longer then it ſucketh of her breaſtes. And in this ſorte it would chaunce to men, yea and worſe to, if women were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the common wealth. For though one ſhoulde knowe the mother, whiche hath borne him: he ſhould not knowe the father that hath begotten him. The <hi>Tharentines</hi> (whiche were well renowmed amongeſt the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientes, and not a litle feared of the Romaines) had in their citie of <hi>Tharente</hi> a lawe and cuſtome, to marie them ſelues with a legittimate wife, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gette children: but beſides her a man might yet choſe twoo others for his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret pleaſures. <hi>Spartianus</hi> ſaide that the Emperour <hi>Hellus Verus,</hi> as thouching women, was very diſſolute: and ſince his wife was younge and faire, and that ſhe did complaine of hym becauſe he ledde no honeſt lyfe with her, he ſpake theſe wordes vnto her. My wyfe, thou haſte no cauſe to complayne of me, ſynce I remayne with thee vntill ſuche tyme as thou arte quicke with chylde: For the reſidue of the tyme, we huſbandes haue licence and priuilege to ſeke our paſtimes with other women. For this name of a wyfe, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in it honour: but for the reſidue, it is a greuous burden and painfull of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. The like matter came to <hi>Ptolome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Admitte that all the Grekes haue bene eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be very wyſe, amongeſt all thoſe the <hi>Athenians</hi> were eſtemed of moſt excellent vertue: for the ſages that gouerned the common wealth, remained in <hi>Athens</hi> with the philoſophers which taught the ſciences. The ſages of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> ordeined, that all the neighbours and inhabitauntes might kepe twoo lawful wiues, &amp; furthermore vpon paine of greuous puniſhmentes did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none ſhuld preſume, nor be ſo hardie to maintaine any concubine: for they ſayde, when men haunte the companie of light women, commonly they miſuſe their lawfull wiues. As <hi>Plutarche</hi> ſaith in his politiques, the cauſe why the Grekes made this lawe was, conſidering that man coulde not, nor ought not to liue without the company of a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and therfore they wold that man ſhuld mary with two wiues. For if the one were diſeaſed and lay in, yet the other might ſerue in bedde, wayte at the table, and doe other buſynes in the houſe. Thoſe of <hi>Athens</hi> had an other great reſpect and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to make this lawe, which was this, that if it chaunced the one to be barrayne, the other ſhould brynge foorth chyldren in the common wealthe:
<pb facs="tcp:21411:109"/>
and in ſuche caſe ſhe that brought forth children, ſhould be eſtemed for mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres: and the other that was barraine, ſhould be taken for a ſeruaunt. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this law was made, <hi>Socrates</hi> was married with <hi>Xantippa,</hi> and to accompliſh the lawe, he toke an other called <hi>Mitra,</hi> whiche was the doughter of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher <hi>Ariſtides:</hi> and ſithe thoſe two women had great quarrels, &amp; debates together, and that thereby they ſlaundered their neighbours, <hi>Socrates</hi> ſayde vnto them. My wyues, you ſee righte well that my eyes are holowe, my legges are wythered, my handes are wryncled, my head is balde, the body is litle, and the heares are whyte: why doe ye then that are ſo faire, ſtand in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and ſtrife for me that am ſo defourmed? though <hi>Socrates</hi> ſayde theſe wordes (as it were in ieſte) yet ſuche woordes were occaſion, that the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relles and ſtrifes betwene them ceaſed. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> (that in tyme of peace and warre, were alwayes contrarie to the <hi>Athenians</hi>) obſerued it for an inuiolate lawe, not that one man ſhould mary with twoo wyues, but that one woman ſhould mary with twoo huſbandes: and the reaſon was, that when one huſbande ſhould go to the warres, the other ſhould tary at home. For they ſayde, that a man in no wyſe ſhould agree to leaue his wife alone in the common wealth. <hi>Plinie</hi> wryting an Epiſtle to his frende <hi>Locratius,</hi> and ſaint <hi>Hyerome</hi> wryting to a friere called <hi>Ruſticus</hi> ſaieth, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> dyd vſe to marie the bretherne with the ſiſters: but they did not permitte the Auntes to marie with their nephewes, neither the vncles with their neices. For they ſaide, that brothers and ſiſters to marye togethers, was to marye with their ſemblable: but for vncles to marye nieces, and auntes with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, was as of fathers to doughters, &amp; of mothers to ſonnes. <hi>Melciades</hi> whiche was a man of great renowne amongeſt the Gretians, had a ſonne called <hi>Cymonius</hi> who was maried to his ſyſter called <hi>Pinicea,</hi> and beinge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of one why he toke his ſiſter in mariage, he aunſwered: my ſyſter is fayre, ſage, ryche, and made to my appetite, and her father and myne dyd recommaund her vnto me, and ſince by the commaundement of the Gods a man ought to accompliſhe the beheſtes and requeſtes of fathers: I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined (ſince nature hath geuen her me for my ſyſter) willingly to take her for my lawfull wyfe. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſayth, that before the Egiptians recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any lawes, euery man had as many wyues as he would: and this was at the libertie of both parties, for as muche as if ſhe would go, ſhe went libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and forſooke the man: and likewiſe he left her, when ſhe diſpleaſed him. For they ſaide that it was impoſſible for men and women to liue long toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without muche trouble, contentions, and brawles. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſaid one thing, ſpeaking of this matter, that I neuer red in any booke, nor heard of the auncientes paſte, whiche was that amongeſt the Egiptians there was no difference in children: for they acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted them all legittimate, though they were children of ſlaues. For they ſaide, that the principall doer of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration was the father, and not the mother, and that therefore the children whiche were borne among them, toke only the fleſhe of the mother, but they did inherite the honour and dignitie of the parte of the father. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in his commentaries ſaieth, that (in great Britaine, called nowe Englande) the Britons had an vſe, that one woman was maried vnto fiue men, the which beaſtlines is not redde to haue bene in any nation of times paſte: for if it be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21411:109"/>
ſclaunder for one man to haue diuers wyues, why ſhoulde it not alſo be a ſclanderous and ſhamefull thing, for one woman to haue many huſbandes. The noble and vertuous women ought to be maried for twoo cauſes. The firſt to the ende God ſhould geue them children, and benediction, to whome they may leaue their goodes, and their memory. The ſecond, to thend they ſhould liue euery one in their owne houſe, accompanied and honoured with their huſbandes. For otherwiſe, I ſaie for a truthe, that the woman that is not contented and ſatiſfied with her owne propre huſbande, will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented nor ſatiſfied with all men in the worlde. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his apotheames ſayeth, that the <hi>Cymbres</hi> did vſe to mary with their propre &amp; naturall dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: the whiche cuſtome was taken from them by the Conſul <hi>Marius,</hi> after that he did ouercome them in Germany, and that of them he had triumphed at Rome. For the chylde whiche was borne of ſuche mariage, was ſonne of the doughter of one ſole father, and was ſonne and brother of one onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they were alſo coſins, nephewes, and brother of one onely father &amp; brother. Truly ſuche cuſtome procedeth rather of wylde beaſtes, then of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures: for many or the more parte of brute beaſtes (after the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males haue brought forth males) within one yeare after they doe accompany with their dammes which brought them forth. <hi>Strabo</hi> in the ſituation of the worlde, and <hi>Seneca</hi> in an Epiſtle ſaye, that the <hi>Lydes</hi> and the <hi>Armenians</hi> had a cuſtome, to ſende their doughters to the Ryuers and hauens of the ſea to gette their mariages, ſelling their owne bodies to ſtraungers: ſo that thoſe whiche would marie were firſte forced to ſell their virginitie. The Romains (whiche in all their affayres and buſyneſſes were more ſage and modeſte, then other nations) vſed muche circumſpection in all their mariages: For they kepte it as an auncient lawe, and vſe accuſtomed, that euery Romaine ſhould marie with one woman, and no mo. For euen as to kepe two wyues among the Chriſtians, is a great conſcience; ſo was it demed amongeſt the Romaines muche infamie.</p>
                     <p>Amongeſt the auncient and renowmed oratours of Rome, one was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Metellus Numidicus,</hi> the whiche one daye makinge his oration to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, ſayde theſe wordes. Worthy Senatours, I let you vnderſtande, that I haue greatly ſtudied what the counſelles ſhould be, that I ought to geue ye touching mariage: For the counſell raſhe and ſodeyne, oftentymes is not profitable. I doe not perſwade you at all to mary, neyther doe ſaye that ye ſhall not mary: but it is true, that if ye can lyue without a woman, yee ſhall be free from many troubles. But what ſhall we doe, O ye Romaines, ſynce that nature hath made vs ſuch, that to kepe women it is a great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and to lyue without them, it is more daunger. I dare ſaye (if in this caſe my opinion myght be accepted) that it ſhould not be euyll done to reſiſte the luſt, ſince it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by fittes: and not to take wiues, which are continuall troubles. Theſe were the wordes, which <hi>Metellus Numidicus</hi> ſpake, the which were not very acceptable, nor pleaſaunt to the fathers being in the Senate: for they would not that he ſhuld haue ſpoken ſuch wordes againſt mariage. For there is no eſtate in this lyfe, wherein fortune ſheweth her force more: then in this ſtate of matrimonie. A man maye proue them in this ſort, that if the faſhions and vſages of the auncientes were diuerſe, as concernynge
<pb facs="tcp:21411:110"/>
ordinaunce: truly there was no leſſe contrarietie in their contractes, and ceremonies. <hi>Boccaſe</hi> the Florentine, in a booke that he made of the mariages of the auncientes, reciteth many and ſondrie cuſtomes that they vſed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the mariages, whereof he telleth ſome, not for to allowe, nor maintaine them: but to reproue and condemne them. For the wryters did neuer wryte the vices of ſome, but onely to make the vertues of others more clerely to be knowen. The <hi>Cymbres</hi> had a cuſtome that when they would marie (after the mariage was nowe agreed vpon) he that was made ſure, ſhoulde pare his nayles, and ſende them to his wife that ſhould be: and ſhe in like ſorte ſent hers vnto him. And then when ſhe of him, and he of her had receiued the nayles the one of the other, they toke them ſelues maried for euer: and did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes liue together as man and wyfe. The <hi>Theutonians</hi> had a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that the man that was ſure, rounded the heere of her to whome he was made ſure, and ſhe did the lyke vnto him: and when the one ſuffered the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to doe ſo, immediatly they celebrated mariage. The <hi>Armenians</hi> hadde a lawe, that the brydegrome ſhould pinche the right eare of the bryde, and the bryde ſhould likewyſe pinche the lefte eare of the brydegrome: and then they tooke them ſelues maried for euer. The <hi>Elamites</hi> had a cuſtome, that both parties whiche were made ſure, pricked one the others litle finger vntil they bledde: the whiche bloud they did ſucke naturally, and this done they were maried. The <hi>Numidians</hi> vſed, that the brydegrome and the bryde ſhoulde gather together a pece of earth, and with their ſpet tell they tempered it, and therewith the one annointed the foreheade of the other: ſo that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage betwene theym, was to annoynte the one and the other with a litle claye. When thoſe of <hi>Dace</hi> would be maried, the brydegrome and the bryde, eche one by them ſelues, were brought in chariottes, the one metinge the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and when they came togethers, the brydegrome gaue a newe name to the bryde, and ſhe likewyſe to him, and from that tyme forewarde they liued as in lawfull matrimony. When thoſe of Hungary would marye, the one ſent vnto the other a familier god made of ſyluer, whom they called <hi>Lares,</hi> and when they had receiued the God of eche other, the mariage was fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and they lyued as man and wyfe. The <hi>Siconians</hi> had a cuſtome and lawe, that when they ſhould mary, the one ſent to the other a ſhooe: and that receiued of both, they agreed to the mariage. The <hi>Tharentins</hi> had a cuſtome, that when they did marie, they ſet them ſelues at the table to eate, and the one did feade the other: ſo that if by miſhappe the one ſhould chaunce to feade him ſelfe, that mariage was not eſtemed for conſtant, nor good. The <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> had a cuſtome, and they kept it as a lawe, that when men and women ſhould marie, as nowe they touche the handes the one of the other: ſo did they them touche with their feete, afterwards they ſet together their knees, then they touched with their handes, and then they ſette their buttockes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſo their heades, and in the ende they imbraced the one the other. All theſe ceremonies done, the mariages were aſſured, and ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: and ſo we might ſaye of many others, but to auoyde tediouſnes we will folowe our matter.</p>

For the which it is alſo neceſſary, that we geue now vnto the wyues ſome healthfull counſell, whereby they may beare and ſuffre quietly ſuche great troubles. For at this daye there is no huſbande ſo louing, nor ſo vertuous, in whom the wife ſhall not finde ſome euill conditions. Firſt of al wiues ought to endeuour them ſelues to loue their huſbandes vnfainedly, if they deſire their huſbandes ſhould loue them without diſſimulation: for as we ſee by experience, mariage is ſeldome broken through pouertie, nor yet continued with riches. For the euill maried folkes through debate, and ſtrife, be ſeparated in on week, where as by good and true loue they are preſerued all the dayes of their life. To eate drie and vnſauory meates, they vſe to take ſalte for to amende it. I meane, that the burdens of matrimonie are many, and troubleſome, the whiche all with loue onely maye be endured. For as <hi>Plato</hi> the deuine philoſopher ſayeth, one thinge oughte not to be called more painefull then an other, for the labour we thereunto employ: but for the great or ſmall loue that thereunto we haue. Though ſome ſondry thyngs be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and tedious, yet when with loue it is begonne, it is eaſely folowed, and ioyefully achieued: for that trauayle is nothyng noyſome, where loue is the mediatour. I knowe right well and doe confeſſe that the counſell whiche I geue to women is ſharpe, that is: for an honeſt woman to loue a diſſolute man, for a ſage wyfe to loue a fooliſhe huſbande, for a vertuous wyfe, to loue a vitious huſbande. For as dayly experience ſheweth, there are ſome men of ſo fooliſh conditions, &amp; other women of ſo noble conuerſation,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:111"/>
that by reaſon apparant they ought to take them for miſtreſſes, rather then they ſhould accepte them for huſbandes. Although this, in ſome particuler caſes is true, I ſaye and affirme, that generally all women are bounde to loue their huſbandes, ſince that willingly, and not by compulſion they were not enforced to take them: for in like manner, if the mariage pleaſed not the woman, ſhe hath not ſo much cauſe to complaine of her huſbande for aſking her: as ſhe hath reaſon to complayne of her owne ſelfe that accepted hym. For the miſfortunes that by our folly doe chaunce, though we haue cauſe to lamente them, we ought alſo to haue reaſon to diſſemble them. Be the man neuer ſo wylde and euill brought vp, it is impoſſible, if the wife loue him, but he muſt nedes loue her againe. And though perchaunce he can not force his euill condition to loue her, yet at the leaſte he ſhall haue no occaſion to hate her. The whiche ought not to be litle eſtemed, for there are many wyues not onely of the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> but alſo of the noble dames, that coulde be content to forgeue their huſbandes all the pleaſure they ſhould doe them, and alſo all the loue that they ought to ſhewe: if they would refraine their tongues from ſpeaking iniurious wordes, and kepe their handes from dealinge lothſome ſtripes. We haue many notable examples in hiſtories, of manye noble and ſtoute Ladies (as well Grekes as Romaines) whiche after they were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, had ſo great faithfulnes, and bare ſuche loyaltie to their huſbandes: that they not onely folowed them in their trauailes, but alſo deliuered them in their daungers. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the booke of noble women declareth, that the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cedemonians,</hi> keping many nobles of the <hi>Athenians</hi> priſoners (whiche at that tyme were their cruell and mortall enemies) and beinge iudged to die: their wyues concluded to goe to the pryſon where they laye, and in the ende they obtayned of the Gayler thereof, that they myght goe in, and talke with their huſbandes: for in dede the teares were many that before them were ſhed, &amp; the giftes were not fewe whiche vnto them were offered. The wiues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entring into the pryſon did not onely chaunge their apparell with their huſbandes, but alſo the libertie of their perſonnes: for they went out as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the women in their ſteades remained there as men. And when they brought out theſe innocent wyues from pryſon, to execute iuſtice, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they were men, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> vnderſtandinge the faithfulnes of the women, determined that they ſhould not only be pardoned: but alſo that they ſhould be greatly rewarded, and honoured, for the good examples of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther women to whom they were maried. The auncient and great renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Panthea,</hi> when newes was brought her that her huſbande was dead in the battayle, ſhe her owne ſelfe determined to goe ſeke him out, with hope that as yet he was not vtterly dead: and fynding him dead, with the bloud of him ſhe waſhed all her body, and likewyſe her face, ſtryking with a knife her ſelfe to the harte, and imbracing her huſbande ſhe yelded vp the ghoſt, &amp; ſo togethers they were caried to the graue. <hi>Porcia,</hi> the doughter of <hi>Marcus Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> the great, when ſhe hearde that her huſband <hi>Brutus</hi> was taken and ſlayn, ſhe felte for that newes ſo great ſorowe, that all her frendes ſeinge her take the matter ſo greuouſly, hidde from her all Irone where with ſhe might kill her ſelfe: and did laboure to kepe and preſerue her from daungers, wherein ſhe might fall and ſhorten her life. For ſhe was ſo excellent a Romaine, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21411:111"/>
ſo neceſſary to the common wealth, that if they had lamented the death of <hi>Brutus</hi> her huſband, with teares of their eies: they ought to bewayle the loſſe of his wife <hi>Porcia,</hi> with droppes of bloud in their hartes. <hi>Porcia</hi> therefore fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in her ſelfe a wofull and afflicted harte, for the death of her entierly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued huſband, to declare that that whiche ſhe did was not fained, nor for to pleaſe the people, but to ſatiſfie her great &amp; marueilous loue: ſince ſhe founde neither ſworde nor knife to kill her ſelfe, nor corde to hange her ſelfe, neither welle to drowne her in, ſhe went to the fire, and with as great pleaſure did eate the hote firie coales, as an other would haue eaten any delicate meates. We may ſay that ſuch kinde of death was very ſtraunge and newe, whiche the Romaine founde to encreaſe, augmente, and manifeſt her loue: Yet we can not denie, but that ſhe wanne to the poſteritie of her name a perpetuall memorie. For as a noble dame ſhe would quenche with coles of fire her bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning harte, that enflamed was with firie brondes of loue. As <hi>Diodorus Sicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> ſaith, it was a lawe &amp; cuſtome amongeſt the <hi>Lidians,</hi> to mary them ſelues with many wiues: and whan by chaunce their huſbandes died, the wiues which they had met together, and fought in ſome plaine place. And the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which remained only aliue, and of the conflict had the victory, caſt them ſelues into the graue of their huſbande: ſo that thoſe women then fought for to die, as men nowe fight for to liue.</p>

                     <head>¶Of the reuenge a woman of Grece toke of him that had killed her huſband, in hope to haue her in mariage. Cap. v.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>PLutarche</hi> in the booke that he made of the noble and worthy women, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth a thing worthy of reherſall, and to be had in memory.</p>
                     <p>In the citie of <hi>Galacia</hi> were two renowmed citezens, whoſe names were, <hi>Sinatus</hi> &amp; <hi>Sinoris,</hi> whiche were by bloud coſins, &amp; in familiaritie frendes: and for the loue of a Grekes doughter, being very noble, beautifull, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceading gratious, they both ſtriued to haue her in mariage, and for to attain to their deſires, they both ſerued her, they both folowed her, they both loued her, and for her both of them deſired to die. For the dart of loue, is as a ſtroke with a clod of earth: the which being throwen amongeſt a company, dothe hurte the one, and blinde the others. And as the fatal deſtinees had ordeined it. <hi>Sinatus</hi> ſerued this lady called <hi>Camma</hi> in ſuche ſorte, that in the ende he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined her in mariage for his lawfull wife: whiche thing when <hi>Sinoris</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he was aſhamed of his doinges, &amp; was alſo wounded in his harte. For he loſt not only that, which of ſo long time he had ſought, loued, and ſerued: but alſo the hope to attaine to that, which chiefly in his life he deſired. <hi>Sinatus</hi> therfore ſeing that his wife <hi>Camma</hi> was noble, meke, gratious, faire, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and that in all thinges ſhe was comely and well taught: decreed to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer her to the goddeſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> to the end that ſhe would preſerue her from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, and keape her from infamie. Truly we cannot reproue the knight <hi>Sinatus</hi> for that he did, nor we ought to note him for raſhe in his counſel: for he ſawe that his wife was very faire, and therfore much deſired. For with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie that is kepte, whiche of many is deſired. Though <hi>Camma</hi> was nowe married, and that ſhe was in the protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the goddeſſe <hi>Diana:</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding her olde frend <hi>Sinoris</hi> died for her ſake, and by all meanes poſſible he ſerued her, continually he importuned her, daily he folowed her, &amp; howerly
<pb facs="tcp:21411:112"/>
he required her. And all this he did, vppon certayne hope he had, that ſuche diligent ſeruice ſhould ſuffice to make her chaunge her ſacred mynde: and as ſhe had choſen <hi>Sinatus</hi> for her huſbande openly, ſo he thought ſhe ſhoulde take him for her frend ſecretly. For many women are as men without taſt through ſickenes, the which eate more of that that is hurtful and forbidden: then of that whiche is healthſome, and commaunded. Not without a cauſe <hi>Camma</hi> was greatly renowmed throughout all <hi>Galatia</hi> for her beautie: and much more among the vertuous eſteamed for her honeſtie. The which eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in this was ſene, that after ſhe was maried, <hi>Sinoris</hi> could neuer cauſe her to receiue any iewell, or other gifte, nor that ſhe would heare him ſpeake any worde, nor that ſhe would ſhew her ſelfe in the wyndowe, either to him, or to any other, to the ende to be ſene in the face. For it is not ſufficient for Ladies to be pure good: but alſo to geue no occaſion for men to iudge (that if they durſte) they would be euill. As it is true in dede, that the harte which is intangled with loue, dare boldely aduenture him ſelfe in many kynde of daungers, to accompliſhe that whiche he deſired: ſo <hi>Sinoris</hi> ſeing that with faire wordes he could not flatter her, nor with any giftes wynne her, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to kyll <hi>Sinatus</hi> her huſbande, vpon hope that when ſhe ſhould be wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, he might eaſely obteine her in matrimonie. For he thought although <hi>Camma</hi> was not euyll, it was not for that ſhe wanted deſier to do it: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had no commodious place to accompliſhe it. And to be ſhorte, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris</hi> would neades execute and bryng to effect his deuellyſhe and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intente: ſo that ſone after he vylie ſlewe his ſaide compaignion <hi>Sinatus.</hi> After whoſe death the noble lady <hi>Camma</hi> was of <hi>Sinoris</hi> greatly deſired, and by his parentes muche importuned, that ſhe would condiſcende to take and mary him, and that ſhe would forgyue him the death of her huſband <hi>Sinatus,</hi> whiche then was buried. And as ſhe was in all her doinges ſuche a prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly woman, ſhe imagened with her ſelfe, that vnder the pretence of mariage, ſhe might haue opportunitie to accompliſhe her deſiers: wherfore ſhe aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered vnto his parentes, that ſhe did accepte their counſel, and ſaide to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris</hi> that ſhe did chooſe him for her huſbande, ſpeakyng theſe woordes more for to comforte him, then with intente to pardon him. And as amongeſt thoſe of <hi>Galatia</hi> there was a cuſtome, that the newe maried folkes ſhoulde eate togethers in one diſhe, and drynke in one cuppe: the daye that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was celebrated, <hi>Camma</hi> determined to prepare a cuppe with poyſon, and alſo a lute, wherewith ſhe began to playe, and ſinge with her propre voyce before the goddeſſe <hi>Diana</hi> in this maner.</p>

And truly her death of all Grece, with as great ſorowe was lamented: as her life of all men was deſired. Princeſſes and great Ladies, may moſte euidently perceiue by the examples herein conteyned, howe honeſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable it is for them to loue, and endeuoure them ſelues to be beloued of their huſbandes: and that not onely in their lyfe, but alſo after their deathe. For the wyfe to ſerue her huſbande in his life, ſeameth oft tymes to proceade of feare: but to loue and honour him in his graue, proceadeth of loue. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and great Ladies ought not to doe that, which many other women of the common people doe, that is to wete, to ſeke ſome drinkes and inuente ſome ſhamefull ſorceries to be beloued of their huſbandes: for albeit it is a great burden of conſcience, and lacke of ſhame in lyke maner to vſe ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, yet it ſhould be a thing to vniuſt and very ſlaunderous, that for to be beloued of their huſbandes, they ſhould procure to bee hated of God. Truly to loue, to ſerue, and contente God, it is not hurtefull to the woman, for that ſhe ſhould be the better beloued of her huſbande: but yet God hathe ſuffered, and doth permitte oftetymes, that the women beinge feble, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med poore, and negligent, ſhould be better beloued of their huſbandes, then the diligent, faire, and ryche. And this is not for the ſeruices they doe to their huſbandes, but for the good intention they haue to ſerue, &amp; loue God, whiche ſheweth them this eſpeciall fauour: for otherwyſe God doth not ſuffer, that he being with her diſpleaſed, ſhe ſhould lyue with her huſbande contented. If women would take this councell that I geue them in this caſe, I wil teache them furthermore a notable enchauntement, to obteine the loue of their huſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bandes, whiche is: that they be quiet, meke, pacient, ſolitary, and honeſt, with which fiue herbes they may make a confection, the which neither ſeene nor taſted of their huſbands, ſhal not onely cauſe them to be beloued, but alſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.

                     <p>MAny auncient hiſtoriographers trauailed greatly, and conſumed long tyme in wryting, to declare what authoritie the man ought to haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the woman, and what ſeruitude the woman oweth to the man: and ſome for to auaunce the dignitie of the man, and others to excuſe the frailtie of the woman, alleged ſuch vayne thinges, that it had bene more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb facs="tcp:21411:114"/>
for them not to haue written at all, then in ſuche ſorte as they did. For it is not poſſible but the wryters ſhould erre, whiche wryte not as reaſon teacheth, but rather as their fantaſie leadeth. Thoſe that defende the frailtie of the women ſaied, that the woman hath a body as a man, ſhe hath a ſoule as a man, ſhe hath reaſon as a man, dieth as a man, and was as neceſſarie for generation as man, ſhe liueth as a man, and therefore they thought it not mete that ſhe ſhould be more ſubiect to man, then man to her: for it is not reaſon that that whiche nature hath made free, ſhould by any lawes of man be made bond. They ſaide furthermore, that God created not the creatours, but to augmente the generation of mankinde, and that in this caſe the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was more neceſſary then the man: for the man engendreth without payne or trauayle, but the woman is deliuered with perill and daunger, and with payne and trauayle noryſheth vp the childe. Wherfore it ſeameth great vnkindnes and crueltie, that the women (whiche are deliuered with peryll, and daunger of their lyues, and brynge vp their chyldren with laboure, and toyle of their bodyes) ſhould be vſed of their huſbandes as ſclaues. They ſayed further, that men are thoſe that curſſe, that moue ſeditions, that make warres, that mayntayne enmytie, that weare weapons, that ſheade mans bloude, and committe ſondrie other miſchiefes, whiche the women doe not: but in ſteade of kylling menne, ſheading bloude, and other notorious euilles that men doe, they imploye them ſelues to increaſe men. And ſince it is ſo, then women, rather then men, oughte to haue dominion, and commaunde in the common wealthe: for women increaſe the common wealth, and men dyminiſhe it. For neyther deuine nor humayne lawe commaundeth, that the foolyſhe man ſhould be free, and gouerne: and that the wyſe woman ſhould be bonde, and ſerue. Thoſe of <hi>Achaia</hi> affirmed this opinion, and groundeth them ſelues vppon this reaſon, and obſerued it as a cuſtome: that the huſbandes ſhould obeye, and the wyues commaunde. And ſo they dyd, as <hi>Plutarche</hi> ſayeth in the booke of conſolation: for the huſbande ſwept and made cleane the houſe, made the bedde, waſſhed the bucke, couered the table, dreſſed the dynner, and went for water. And of the contrary part, his wyfe gouerned the goodes, aunſwered the affayres, kepte the money, &amp; if ſhe were angrye, ſhee gaue hym not onely foule woordes: but alſo ofte tymes layed her handes on hym, to reuenge her anger. And hereof came this auncient prouerbe, the which of many is redde, and of fewe vnderſtanded: that is to wete, <hi>Vita Achaiae,</hi> the lyfe of an <hi>Achaian.</hi> When in Rome the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſuffred to be ruled &amp; commaunded of his wyfe, the neighbours would ſaie vnto him in maner of a reproche, <hi>Vita Achaiae:</hi> whiche is as muche as if a man would ſay, go, go, as thou art, ſince thou liueſt after the law of <hi>Achaia,</hi> where men haue ſo litle diſcretion, that they ſuffer them ſelues to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (be it well or euil) of their wyues, and that euery woman commaundeth her huſbande. <hi>Plinie</hi> in an epiſtle that he wrote, reproued greatly his frende <hi>Fabatus,</hi> for that he kepte in his houſe a wyfe, the whiche in al his doinges ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and commaunded him: wherein he tolde him that he durſt do nothinge, without her commaundement. And to make the matter to ſeme more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, in the latter ende of his epiſtle he ſaide theſe wordes, <hi>Me valde poenitet quod tu ſolus Rome polles vita Achaiae:</hi> whiche is, it greueth me muche that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21411:114"/>
thou alone in Rome ſhouldeſt leade the life of one of <hi>Achaia. Iulius Capitoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſayth, that <hi>Anthonius Caracalla,</hi> being in loue with a faire Lady of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſeing that he could not enioy her nor obtaine his deſire, promiſed to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie her according to the lawe of <hi>Achaia:</hi> and truly ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe more wiſe in her aunſwere, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did in his demaund, telling him that ſhe would not, nor might not marye, for becauſe ſhe had promiſed her ſelfe to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Veſta,</hi> and that ſhe had rather be a ſeruaunte of the gods, then a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe of men. The <hi>Parthes</hi> had a law contrary to them, and likewiſe thoſe of <hi>Thrace,</hi> the which ſo lytle eſteamed women, that their huſbandes vſed them none otherwiſe then lyke ſeruauntes.</p>
                     <p>And in this caſe men had ſo great lybertie, or to ſay better, lightnes: that after a woman had borne and brought forth twelue children, the children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned in the houſe, and the huſbandes ſold their wiues to them that wold giue moſt, or els they chaunged them for others that were more yong.</p>
                     <p>And the children agreed to the ſelling of their owne mother, to thintent that their father might refreſh himſelfe with another that was more yong: and the old and baren woman, ſhould eyther be buried quicke, or els ſerue as a ſlaue. <hi>Dioniſius Halicarnaſeus</hi> ſayth, that the <hi>Lides</hi> had a law, and the <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midians</hi> in lyke maner, that the woman ſhould commaund thinges without the houſe, and the man ſhould prouide for thoſe that were within. But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my poore iudgement, I cannot tell how this law was kept, nor how they could fulfil it, for by reaſon the wife ſhould not go out of the houſe but very lytel, and therfore me thinketh that they ought not to commaund any thing abroade, nor the huſband ſhould enter into another mans houſe, for to commaund there. <hi>Ligurgus</hi> in the lawes that he gaue to the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> ſayth, that the huſbands ſhould prouyde abrode, ſee al thinges neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the houſe, and that the wiues ſhould keape and dipoſe them within: ſo that this good philoſopher deuided the trauaile betwene the man and the woman, but yet notwithſtanding he reſerued the rule and aucthority to the man For to ſay the truth, it is a monſterous thing that the wife ſhoulde commaund the huſband in his houſe. Vnder our Chriſtian relygion ther is neyther deuine, nor humaine lawes, but wil preferre man aboue all other thinges: and though ſome philoſophers would diſpute to the contrary, &amp; that manye men would haue folowed theym, yet me thinketh that a man ſhould not prayſe nor commende them for their opinyons. For there can be nothyng more vaine nor lyght, then by mans lawe to giue that aucthority to woman, which by nature is denyed her.</p>
                     <p>We ſe by experience that women of nature are al weake, fraile, feareful, and tender: and finally in matters of weight not very wiſe. Then if mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of gouernment requyre not only ſcience &amp; experience, but alſo ſtrengthe &amp; courage to enterpriſe doubtfull things, wiſedome for to know them, force to execute them, dyligence for to folow them, pacyence to ſuffer them, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to endure theym, and aboue all great ſtrengthe and hope to compaſſe them: why then wyl they take frome man the gouernemente, in whom all theſe thynges abounde, and giue it to the woman, in whome all theſe theſe thyngea do wante? The ende whye I ſpeake theſe thynges before, is to requyre, to counſell, to admoniſhe, and to perſwade Princeſſes, and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:115"/>
great Ladyes, that they thinke it ſpoken (if they wilbe happie in mariage) to thend they ſhould be obedient to their huſbandes: for ſpeaking the truth, in that houſe where the wife commaundeth the huſband, we may cal her a maſculyne woman, and him a feminine man. Many women are deceyued, in thinking that in commaunding their huſbands they lyue more honorably and be better eſteamed: but truly it is not ſo, for all thoſe that ſee, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, accompteth the woman for vaine, and the men in lyke maner for folyſhe. I know, and can tel right wel, that there are ſome huſbandes ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue in ſpending, and ſo wanton in liuing, that it were not only good that their wiues ſhould rule them, but alſo chaſtice theym, but yet in the end I ſaye, that notwithſtandynge all this is better and more tollerable that all the goodes be loſt, then betwene them any malyce, hate or diſſencion ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If a womans chyldren dye, ſhe may bring forth others, if ſhe looſe her goods, ſhe may get them againe, if her ſeruauntes goeth from her, ſhe may find others, if ſhe ſe her ſelf ſad, God may comfort her, if ſhe be ſicke, ſhe may be healed, but if ſhe be at debate with her huſband, I cannot tell what ſhe ſhal do: for the wife that forſaketh the frendſhip of her huſband, gyueth to all men occaſion to ſpeake of her follye. Sith women naturally are all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe, and that of gelouſye procedeth ſuſpition, I counſel them, if they will not that their huſbandes commit a fault, that they do not anger nor chafe them: for if in gage ſhe haue his hart, no other woman ſhal haue his body, becauſe from that which he would not abſteyne for conſience, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine for ſhame. Oft times y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> huſbands come home chafed, troubled, wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, angry, and vexed: and then women ought to take hede that they ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart them not, for if they do it cannot be otherwiſe, but that they ſhall haue eyther euil wordes with his tongue, or els ſuffer ſore blowes with his fiſtes. Truly it is not mete, neyther in any caſe profitable, that Princeſſes &amp; great dames ſhould ouerthwarte their huſbandes with froward wordes, nor that they ſhould vſe to ſtriue againſt them, but rather that the wife in all caſes ſhould be obedient, and louyng to her huſbande: for it may happen and dayly it doth chaunce, that they begin to argew in ieſt, and afterward they end in earneſt. The woman which is ſage, wiſe, and vertuous, ought to wey with her ſelfe, that eyther her huſband hath occaſion ſo to taunt her, or els peraduenture he doth it of a wil. I ſay that in this caſe if he haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, ſhe ought to ſuffer and endure him: if he doth it of will, ſhe ought to diſſemble with him. For otherwiſe, it myght ſo take her in the hed, that ſhe would burden him with many euyll wordes: ſo that he beginnyng then the debate ſhould remayne excuſed, and ſhe being without fault at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, might in the end be condempned.</p>
                     <p>Ther is nothing wherin a woman ſheweth her wiſedom more, then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a raſhe huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. A woman in nothing ſheweth her ſage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She can ſhew her worthines in nothyng ſo much, as in bearing with an vnworthy huſband. I meane, thoughe ſhe vnderſtode that her huſband hath lytle, that he knoweth lytle, and that he were worth lytle: yet ſhe ſhould make men beleue that he hath much, that he knoweth enough, and can do much. For al the honour which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:21411:115"/>
ſhe ſhal giue ſo to her huſband, ſhal wholy againe redounde on her ſelfe. It is an euyl thinge (me thinketh) that women ſhould be ſo bold to ſpeake againſt their huſbandes: for they can not ſay euyl of them, but that they muſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe diſhonour of them ſelues. For if her huſband be a dronkard, they will ſay that ſhe is a dronkardes wife, and if he be a foole, that ſhe is the wife of a foole, and what more: when the huſband ſhal come to amende, and to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate himſelfe, the woman in the end ſhalbe blamed. For if ſhe burden him with euill wordes, he acquyteth her with ſharpe ſtripes. But if ſhe toucheth his honour, it may chaunce he taketh away her lyfe. If perhappes the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhould commaund the wife any vniuſt thing, I would be of opinion that ſhe ſhould obey him, but not reſiſt him: and after that his raging furye were paſt, &amp; his choler qualyfied, then ſhe might ſay vnto him, that he was very raſhe to commaund, and ſhe verye wiſe to obey. For if ſhe be quicke of tongue, to aunſwere to euery word that he ſhal ſpeake, without doubt they wil not lyue one day in concord. Reading therfore that which I haue redde, hearing that whych I haue heard, and hauing ſene alſo that I haue ſene, I would counſel women that they ſhould not preſume to commaunde theyr huſbands: and I would admonyſhe huſbandes that they would not ſuffer their wiues to rule them. For in doing the contrary, it is none otherwiſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eate with the feete and trauaile with the handes, to go with the fingers, and to feede them ſelues with theyr tooes. My mind is not here to ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the woman, nor againſt the Princeſſes and great Ladyes, which of their patrimonye and herytage poſſeſſe many Townes, and Cyties: for to ſuch I wyl not take away the ſeruices, which are due vnto theym by theyr ſubiectes, but I do perſwade theym to the obedyence which they ought to haue to their huſbandes. It is no merueyle thoughe that women of meane eſtate haue ſome tymes quarrelled wyth theyr huſbandes: for they haue ſmal riches to loſe, and leſſe honour to aduenture, then the Princeſſes and great Dames haue, the whych ſynce they do aduenture to commaund ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, why wil they not humble themſelues to obey one? ſpeakyng with due reuerence, It is for aboundaunce of follye, and want of wiſedom, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhold haue preſumption to gouerne a whole Realme, and that ſhe hath not grace to obey one huſband. <hi>Seneca</hi> in a Tragedye ſaith, that in the time of the warre of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> it chaunced in Rome that the Conſulles ſent to the old knightes, ad commaunded that they ſhould al be in a redines to go with <hi>Silla</hi> the Conſull into the warres. And it happened that when they came into ones houſe in Rome to publiſhe the edicte, to warne him to be redye they found not the huſband but the wife, who made anſwere and ſayd: that her huſband ought not nor could not go to the warres, and though he would he ſhoulde not, neither would ſhe giue him lycence. For he was an olde and auncyente knyght, and therefore he oughte to be exempted frome the warres.</p>
                     <p>Wyth this aunſwere, thoſe that herd it were greatly abaſhed, &amp; the whole ſenate no leſſe offended: wherfore they commaunded that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> huſband ſhold be banyſhed Rome, and the wife to be caried to the pryſon <hi>Mamortine,</hi> not for that he excuſed himſelf for going to the warres: but becauſe ſhe comaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her huſband, and bycauſe he ſuffered himſelfe to be commaunded of her.

Oh, god giueth a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gift &amp; grace to that man which hath ſuch and ſo good a wife, that of her owne nature loueth to kepe her ſelfe within the houſe. And truly I ſay that ſuch one doth excuſe many griefes, &amp; ſaueth much money. For ſhe ſpendeth not the goodes in apparel, nor giueth occaſion to men to iudge euil of her perſonne. The greateſt debate that is betwene man and wife, is for that he deſireth to get and kepe his goodes to bringe vp his chyldren, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his family: and on the other part that ſhe deſireth to ſpend all vppon apparell. For women in this caſe are ſo curious in louinge of themſelues, that they would abſteine from meates that ſhould mainteyne their life, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to bye a new gowne to ſet out their pride. Women naturally do loue to keape, and wil not ſpend any thinge, except it be in apparell: For euery houre (that is in the day and the night) they deſire to haue a new gowne to chaunge. My entencyon is not to ſpeake of apparell only, but to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Princeſſes and great Ladyes, that they would kepe themſelues in their houſes: and in ſo doing, they ſhould excuſe theſe ſuperfluous waſtes &amp; expenſes. For her neighbour ſeing her better apparelled then ſhe is, loketh vpon her huſband as ſhe were a Lyon. It chaunceth oftentymes (I would to god I had no cauſe to ſpeake it) that if by chaunce there commeth anye great or ſolempne feaſt or mariage, ſhe wil neuer loke louyngly on his face, before he hath geuen her a new gowne to her backe: and when the poore gentleman hath no money to paye, of neceſſity he muſt runne in credit.

For touching apparell, there is no woman ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> endure that an other meaner woman ſhoulde make compariſon with her, nor that in like maner her equal ſhould excell her. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in the lawes that he gaue to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> commaunded that their wiues ſhould not goe out of their houſes, but at dyuers ſolempne feaſtes in the yere. For he ſayde, that the women ought to be makinge their prayers in the Temples to the gods, or els in their houſes bringing vp their children. For it is not honeſt, nor commendable, that the wife ſhold paſſe her time abroade, trotting from ſtrete to ſtrete as common women. I ſay that the Princeſſes and great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are much more bound to kepe them ſelues at home in their houſes, then other women of meaner degre: &amp; without a cauſe I ſpeake it not, for therby they ſhal get them more reputacion. For ther is no vertue wherby the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man winneth more reputacion in the common wealth, then alwayes to be ſene reſident in her houſe. I ſay alſo that a wife ought the moſt part of her time to keape her houſe, bycauſe ſhe hath leſſe occaſion then other haue to go abroade. For if the poore wife (the <hi>Plebian</hi>) go out of her houſe, ſhe goeth for no other cauſe but for to ſeke meate: but if the riche and noble woman goeth out of her houſe, it is for nothing but to take her pleaſure. Let not princeſſes maruel, nor let not great ladies wonder, if they diſpoſe their feete to trotte, &amp; occupye their eyes to behold, though their ennemyes and neighbours with cankered hartes doth iudge them, and with euil tongues defame them: for the fond dedes that women do, maketh men to be raſh of iudgement. I like it wel that the huſbands ſhould loue their wiues, that they ſhould comfort them, and make much of them, and that they ſhould put their truſt in them: but I do diſcommend that the women ſhould go gadding abroad in viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, from houſe to houſe, &amp; that their huſbands dare not gaine ſay them. For admyt that they be good in their perſonnes: yet in this doing they giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for men to eſteme them vaine and light. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaieth in an epiſtel, that the great Romaine <hi>Cato</hi> the cenſor ordeyned, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no woman ſhold go out of her houſe being alone, &amp; if perhappes it were in the night, ſhe ſhould not go alone without company, &amp; that the company ſhold not be ſuch as ſhe would choſe, but ſuch as her huſband or parent would aſſigne: ſo that with the ſame cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <hi>LUcretia</hi> by the conſent of all, was counted the cheafeſt of all other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones of Rome, and not for that that ſhe was more faire, more wiſe, of greater parentage, or more noble. But becauſe ſhe did withdrawe her ſelfe from company, and abode ſolitary. For ſhe was ſuch a one, that in the heroical vertues there could be nothing more deſired: nor in womens weakenes there was nothinge in her to be amended. The hiſtorye of the chaſt <hi>Lucretia,</hi> is euident in <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> that when the huſbandes of diuers Romaines came home from the warres to their houſes, they founde their wiues in ſuch ſort, that ſome were gaſing out of the windowes, others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing vainely at their doores, others in the field wandering, others in their gardeynes banqueting, others in the market byeng, and others in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the ſtreates, here and there gaddyng: but the famous <hi>Lucretia</hi> was found in her houſe alone, weuing in ſilke, ſo that ſhe flyeng company for that ſhe would not be ſene, made her ſelfe in her honour and renowne better to be knowen. I wil giue an other counſell to Princeſſes and great Ladyes, the which I am willyng to giue, ſo I wiſhe they would be as deſyrous to receiue, that is to wete: if they will be eſtemed and counted for honeſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that they muſt kepe them ſelues from euil company. For thoughe the ſtinking carreine doth no harme, becauſe we eate it not: yet the vnſauorye ſent therof annoyeth vs by ſmelling. The honour of women is ſo delicate a thing, that if we giue them lycence to go abrode to vyſite women: we muſt alſo giue them leue to be viſited of men. For that one Dame ſhould viſite an other, it ſemeth much charitie: but that men ſhould vyſite women, I cannot but thinke it much diſhoneſtye. In the preſence of their huſbandes and nere kynneſfolkes, they may be viſited and talked withall, and this is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtode, of approued and honeſt perſonnes: not withſtanding I ſay if the huſband be not at home, I would it ſhold be compted ſacrilege, if any man paſſe the threſſhold of the doore to viſite the wife. <hi>Plutarche</hi> ſaith in the booke of the prayſes of women, that the wiues of the <hi>Numydians,</hi> when their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes were gone out of their houſes, kept their gates ſhut, &amp; locked them ſelues in their houſes: and they had a lawe, that what ſo euer he were that knocked at the dore beyng ſhutte, without calling, he ſhould haue his righte hand cutte of. <hi>Cicero</hi> in the booke of his lawes ſaieth, that amongeſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines ther was an auncient law, and much vſed: that if perchaunce any woman did owe any monye to any man, and that the huſbande beinge the detter were out of his houſe, the creditour ſhould not aſke his wife the debt, bycauſe that vnder the couller of recouering the goodes, he ſhould not diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her in her fame. I would ſay therefore, that if the creditour was not permitted in Rome to recouer his good? for that the wife was not of her huſbande accompanyed: muche leſſe they woulde giue lycence to viſite a woman alone. For it were more reaſon that the creditour ſhoulde enter for to recouer his goodes: then thou ſhouldeſt enter onlye for thy paſtime. The deuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the bookes of the common wealth ſayth, and by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21411:117"/>
reaſons perſwadeth the wiues of Grece, that they haue no ſecret fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, but that euery one kepe this ſaying in memory for a principal: that the woman ought not to haue any other frend but her huſband. For women oughte not to haue lycence to make frendes: nor condicions to make enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes. Princeſſes and greate Dames oughte to conſider, that euery one of them geueth their bodies, their goodes, and their liberty to their huſbands. Then ſince it is ſo I ſay, that with the lybertie, ſhe ought alſo to geue him her will. For it lytel auaileth the man and the wife that their goodes be common, if their willes be priuate: For to the end that god be ſerued, and the people edified, both ought in one houſe to abide, at one table togethers to eate, in one bedde to ſlepe, and beſides this, they both ought one thinge to loue. For if the man and the wife in loue do differ, in their lyues they ſhal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be quiete. I admonyſh, deſire, and counſel all women, if they wil be wel maried, that they thinke it good that their huſband wil, that they prayſe al that he prayſeth, that they proue al that he proueth, that they content them ſelues with that wherwith their huſbandes are contented, &amp; aboue al, that they loue no more then their huſbandes ſhal loue: for otherwiſe it might be that the wife ſhould ſet her eyes vpon one, and the huſband ingage his hart to an other. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the booke of his pollytikes ſayth, that a woman af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe is maried, hath nothing propre: for the day that ſhe contracteth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariage, ſhe maketh her huſband the only Lord of her goodes, her libertie, and of her perſonne. So that if the wife willeth any other thing, then that which the huſband willeth, if ſhe would loue any other thing then that that her huſband loueth, we wil not cal her a true louer, but an open thefe: for theaues do not ſo much harme to robbe the huſband of his moneye, as the wife doth in withdrawing from him her hart. If the woman wil lyue in peace with her huſband, ſhe ought to marke wherunto he is enclyned, for ſo much as if he be mery, ſhe ought to reioyce, and if he be ſadde, ſhe muſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per her ſelfe, if he be couetous, ſhe ſhould kepe, if he be prodigall, ſhe ſhoulde ſpend, if he be vnpacient, ſhe ſhould dyſſemble, and if he be ſuſpected, ſhe muſt beware. For the woman which is wiſe and ſage, if ſhe can not as ſhe would, ſhe ought to wyl what ſhe may. Wel, whether the huſband be euil inclined, or in his condicions euyl manered, I ſweare, that he cannot ſuffer that his wife ſhold haue any other louers: For though the man be of a meane ſtocke, he had rather alwayes that his wife ſhould loue him alone, then the beſt of the nobilitie in the towne, One thing I cannot diſſemble, bycauſe I ſe that god is therwith offended. Which is, that many Ladyes make their excuſes through ſicknes, becauſe they would not paſt once in the weke come to here ſeruyce and yet we ſe them buſye dayly trotting about to vyſite their fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and the worſt of al is, that in the morning for cold they wil not ryſe to go to the churches, and yet afterwardes in the heate of the daye they go a gaddyng from houſe to houſe, wheras they are often tymes vntyl night.</p>
                     <p>I would that the Ladyes would conſider with theym ſelues, before they ſhould go out of their houſes on viſitacion, to what end they go abroad: and if perchaunce they go abroad to be loked on, let them know for a ſewerty, that ther be few that wil prayſe their beautye, but ther be manye that will dyſcommend their gaddyng. And wherfore do theſe Dames aſſembel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:118"/>
for ſome graue matters I warrant you, ſhal I tel you, it is eyther to banquet with ſome dainty diſhes, to talke of their petigres, to deuyſe of their huſbands, to ſee who hath the beſt gowne, to note who is euil attired, to flatter the faire, to laugh to ſcorne the foule, to mourmure of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and that which is worſt of al, that they them ſelues which ſpeake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll of them that are abſent, do gnaw the one the other with enuye. Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome tymes it chaunceth that the Dames chide not with their huſbands, after that in this ſort they haue bene together: for ſomuche as the one no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the euil apparel, the other babblyng, they note the one to be a foole and the other to be ſimple, ſo that it ſemeth not that they are mete to vyſite the one the other: but to loke, &amp; accuſe the one the other. It is a ſtraung thing for the ſage woman to thinke that ſhe ſhold take pleaſure abroad, ſince ſhe hath her huſband at home to whom ſhe may talke: &amp; hath her children to learne, her doughters to teach, her family to order, and her goodes to gouerne: ſhe hath her houſe to kepe, and her parentes whom ſhe ought to pleaſe: then ſynce ſhe hath within her houſe ſuch paſtime, why do they accept company of ſtraunge men? That maryed women ſhould haue priuate frendes, and loue to be vyſited: it foloweth oftentimes that god is offended, the huſband iniuried, and the people ſlaundered: &amp; the woman that is maried, taketh ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle profite &amp; it hindereth the mariage of her that is to mary. For in ſuch a caſe thoughe ſome deſire her for her riches: yet mo wyl forſake her for her euyl fame.</p>

No man can denay but that mans lyfe is a long and tedious iorney, the which beginneth at our birth, &amp; endeth at our death: for in the end to haue a long or ſhort life is none other, but to come ſoner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the graue. The chiefeſt folly of al (in mine opinion) is this, that ſome in their owne opinions thinke they haue counſel enough for others, and to all others it ſemeth that they want for them ſelues. For of right he may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a foole, that condemneth all other as fooles: and auaunceth himſelfe to be wiſe. Euery man ought to let his neighbour lyue in peace, and though he do eſteame himſelfe to be wiſe, yet he oughte not to thinke his neighbour a foole: for ther is none ſo wyſe, but that he may occupie it all. For we neuer ſaw any man ſo wiſe of himſelfe, but that he neaded the counſel of an other. And if this want be in thoſe that be very old, truly it is much more in them that be yong: whoſe fleſhe is not dry, but grene, the bloud not cold, but hote, no deadly heate, but very liuely, the beſtial mocions not mortifyed, but quick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned, and hereof enſueth, that yong men loue their owne aduyce and opyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and dyſpiſe the counſaile of all other.</p>

They take the haukes in the neaſt, to make them more famyliar: &amp; when the beaſtes are litle, they take them to teach them. I meane, that a man ought to inſtruct his children, to the end they may know to liue wel here after. I admoniſh, and tel the mothers that haue doughters, that ther is no remedy to reforme the euil inclinacion of our children, but to teach them, and to bring them vp wel in their youth: for ther is no wound but is daungerous, if in tyme the playſter be not layd therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Returnyng now to our purpoſe, ſynce that in al thyngs ther is order and meaſure, we wil declare preſently how the male child ought to be taught: &amp; firſt of al we wil treat, how a man ought to prouide when the infant is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and when as yet it is alyue in the mothers wombe, to the entente Princeſſes and great Ladyes ſhould lyue very circumſpectlye, when they know they are conceyued with child. I ſhould be excuſed to ſpeake of this matter, ſince it is not my profeſſion, and that as yet I was neuer maried, but by that I haue red of ſome, and by that I haue hard of others, I will and dare be ſo bold to ſay one word. For the ſage oft times geueth a better accompt, of that he hath red: then the ſimple doth of that he hath proued.</p>
                     <p>Thys thing ſeameth to be true, betwene the phiſicion and the pacient: for wher the pacient ſuffereth the euyl, he oft tymes demaundeth the phyſicion what his ſicknes is, &amp; wher it holdeth him, and what it is called, and what remedy ther is for his diſeaſe: ſo the phiſicion knoweth more by his ſcyence, then the pacient by hys exſperience, A man ought not to denay, that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and in eſpecially great ladyes know not by experience, how they are al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tered when they are quycke, and the great paynes they ſuffer when they are deliuered: we could not denay but that ther is great daunger in the one, &amp; greate peril in the other, but they ſhal not knowe from whence al commeth and from whence al procedeth, and what remedy is neceſſary. For there are many which complayneth of robberyes, but they know not what the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues are that haue robbed them, Firſt according to my iudgement and opiny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that which the woman quicke with childe ought to do, is that they go ſoftly &amp; quietly, and that they eſchue running, eyther in commyng or goyng: for though ſhe lytel eſteme the helth of her perſon, yet ſhe ought greatly to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gard the lyfe of the creature. The more precious the licour is, and the more weaker the veſſell is which conteyneth it: ſo much the more they ought to feare the daunger, leaſt the licoure ſhed, and the veſſel breake. I meane, that the complection of women (being with child) is very delicate, and that the ſoule of the creature is precious, &amp; therfore it ought with great diligence to be preſerued: for al the treaſure of the Indes is not equal in valewe, to that which the woman beareth in her bowelles. Whan a man pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth a vineyard forthwith he maketh a ditch, or ſome fence about it, to the end that beaſtes ſhold not croppe it while it is yong: nor that trauailers ſhold gather the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes when they are ripe. And if the labourer doth this thing for to get a litel wine only, the which for the ſoule and body is not alwayes profitable: how much more circumſpection ought the woman to haue to preſerue her chyld, ſince ſhe ſhall render an accompte to the creator of her creature, vnto the church of a chriſtyan, and vnto her huſband of a child. In my opinyon, wher
<pb facs="tcp:21411:119"/>
the accompt at the houre of death is ſo ſtreight, it is requiſite that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of her life ſhe be circumſpect: for god knoweth euery thinge ſo well in oure lyfe, that ther is none that can begile hym in rendering hys accompt at his death. Ther is no wighte can ſuffer, nor hart dyſſemble, to ſee a man haue hys deſire that is to ſay, to haue his wife great with child, and redy to bring forth good fruite, &amp; afterward to ſe the woful mother, through ſome ſodeine accident peryſhe, &amp; the innocent babe not to be borne. When the woman is healthful, &amp; bigge with child, ſhe is worthy of great reproch, if eyther by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, leaping, or dauncing, any miſchaunce hap vnto her. And truly the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hath great cauſe to lament this caſe: for without doubt the gardiner fealeth great grefe in his hart, when in the prime time the tre is loden with bloſomes, and yet by reaſon of ſome ſharpe and bitter froſte it neuer beareth fruit. It is not only euyl that women ſhould runne &amp; leape when they are bigge, &amp; great with chyld, but it is alſo diſhoneſt, and ſpecially for great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: for alwayes women that be common dauncers, are eſteamed as light houſewiues. The wiues in general, princeſſes and great ladies in particuler, ought to go temperately, &amp; to be modeſt in their mouinges: for the modeſte gate argueth diſcretnes in the perſon. Al women naturally deſire to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, &amp; reuerenced: &amp; touching that I let them know, that ther is nothing which in a common wealth is more honor for a woman, then to be wiſe &amp; ware in ſpeaking, moderate &amp; quyet in going. For it is vnpoſſible but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman which is lyght in her going and malycious in her talking, ſhould be diſpiſed and abhorred. In the yere of the foundacion of Rome .466. the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines ſente <hi>Curius Dentatus</hi> to make warre agaynſt king <hi>Pirrus,</hi> who kept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> city of <hi>Tharent,</hi> &amp; did much harme to the people in Rome: for the Romaines had a great corage to conquere ſtraunge realmes, &amp; therfore they could haue no pacience to ſuffer any ſtraunger to inuade theirs. This <hi>Curius Dentatus</hi> was he which in the end ouercame king <hi>Pirrus,</hi> &amp; was the fyrſt that brought the Oliphantes to Rome in his tryumphe, wherfore the fiercenes of thoſe beaſts aſtonyed the Romaine people much: for they weyed lytel the ſight of the kyngs loden with irons, but to ſe the Oliphants (as they did) they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered much. <hi>Curius Dentatus</hi> had one only ſiſter the which he intierly loued.</p>
                     <p>They wer ſeuen children, two of the which dyed in the warres, &amp; other thre by peſtilence: ſo that ther were none left him, but that ſiſter, wherfore he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her with al his hart.

This ſiſter of <hi>Curius Dentatus</hi> was maried to a Romaine conſul, &amp; was conceiued &amp; gone .7 moneths with child: and the day that her brother triumphed (for ioy of her brothers honor) ſhe lea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ped &amp; daunced ſo much, that in the ſame place ſhe was deliuered, &amp; ſo vnluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely, that the mother toke her death, &amp; the chyld neuer lyued, wherupon, the feaſt of the triumphe ceaſed, and the father of the infant for ſorow loſt hys ſpeach. For the hart which ſodainly feleth grefe, incontinently loſeth vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. <hi>Tibullus</hi> the Grecian, in the third booke <hi>De caſibus triumphi.</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the hyſtorie in good ſtile, how, and in what ſorte it chaunced. Nyne yeares after that the kings of Rome weare bannyſhed from the rape that <hi>Tarquine</hi> dyd to the chaſt <hi>Lucretia,</hi> the Romaine created a dignytie whiche they called <hi>DICTATVRA,</hi> and the Dictatoure that hadde this office,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21411:119"/>
was aboue al other lord &amp; chiefe: for the Romaines perceiued that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth could not be gouerned, but by one head alone. And becauſe the Dictatour had ſo great aucthority, as the Emperour hath at this preſent, &amp; to thend they ſhould not become tirauntes: they prouided that the office of the Dictatourſſhip ſhould laſt no longer then vi. moneths in the yeare, the which paſt and expired they choſe another. Truly it was a good order that that office dured but vi. moneths. For oft tymes princes thinkinge to haue perpetual aucthority, become necligent in vſing iuſtice. The firſt dictatour in Rome was <hi>Largius Mamillus,</hi> who was ſent againſt the <hi>Volces,</hi> the which at that time were the greateſt enemies to the Romaines: for Rome was foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded in ſuch a ſigne, that alwayes it was beloued of fewe, and abhorred of many. As <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> ſaith, this <hi>Largius Mamillus</hi> vanquiſhed the <hi>Volces,</hi> &amp; tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed ouer theym, &amp; in the end of the warre diſtroyed their mighty citye called <hi>Curiola,</hi> and alſo diſtroyed and ouerthrewe many places and fortreſſes in that prouince: for the cruel hartes do not only diſtroy the perſonnes, but alſo take vengeaunce of the ſtones. The hurtes which <hi>Largius Mamillus</hi> did in the country of the <hi>Volces</hi> were maruelous, and the men which he ſlewe were many, and the treaſories he robbed were infinite, and the captiues which he had in his triumphe were a great nomber, amongeſt whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſpecial he brought captiue a noble mans doughter, a beautiful gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the which he kept in his houſe for the recreacion of his perſon: for the aunciente Romaines gaue to the people al the treaſours to maintayne the warre, &amp; they toke to them ſelues al the vycious things to kepe in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The caſe was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this damſel being with child, <hi>Largius Mamillus,</hi> brought her to ſolace herſelfe in his orchard, wher were ſondry yonge fruites, and as then not ripe to eate, wherof with ſo great affection ſhe did eate, that forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe was delyuered in the ſame place of a creature: ſo that on the one part ſhe was delyuered: and on the other part the chylde died.</p>
                     <p>This thinge chaunſed in the gardeins of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> two dayes after the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe of <hi>Largius Mamillus,</hi> a ruful and lamentable caſe to declare, foraſmuch as both the child that was borne, the mother that was delyuered, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the father that begat it, the ſelfe ſame day dyed, and were buried all in one graue: and this thing was not wythout great waylyng, &amp; lamenting throughout al Rome. For if with teares their lyues myght haue bene reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: wythout doubt none of them ſhould haue ben buried. The firſt ſonne of Rome which rebelled againſt rome was <hi>Tarquin</hi> the proud. The ſecond that wythſtode Rome (being as yet in <hi>Lucania</hi>) was <hi>Quintus Marcius.</hi> The third y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> went agaynſt Rome was the cruel <hi>Silla.</hi> The domages which theſe thre, did to their mother Rome, were ſuch and ſo great that the thre ſeueral warres of <hi>Affricke</hi> were nothing to be compared, to thoſe thre euil children: for thoſe enemyes could ſcarcely ſe the walles of Rome, but theſe vnnatural chyldre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had almoſt not left one ſtone vpon another. A man ought not great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to eſteme thoſe buildings that theſe tirauntes threw to the ground, nor the buildings that they diſtroyed, neither the men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſlew, nor the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they forced, ne yet the orphanes which they made: but aboue al things we ought to lament for that, that they brought into Rome. For the comon wealth is not diſtroyed for lacke of riches, &amp; ſumpteous buildings: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:21411:120"/>
vices abound, &amp; vertuous want. Of theſe thre Romaynes, he whoſe name was <hi>Quintus Marcius,</hi> had ben conſul thriſe, once Dictatour, &amp; foure ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Cenſor, and in the end he was with much ſhame baniſhed from Rome, wherwith to reueng this iniury he came with a great power &amp; army againſt Rome: for the proud hart, wounded with iniury, is neuer quiet in his life time vntyl he ſe his enemyes deſtroyed, or that on them he hath taken vengeance. <hi>Quintus Marcius</hi> being very nigh to the gates of Rome, was moſt inſtantlye requyred that he wold not diſtroy his mother Rome: but he toke no regard, nor would condiſcend to any requeſt, vntil ſuch time that his mother iſſewed with a niece of his, whom he loued entierly. At whoſe interceſſion &amp; teares he left his anger, &amp; raiſed his ſiege from Rome: for many are ouercome ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wyth teares, then wyth importunate &amp; reaſonable requeſtes. The ladies of Rome vſed much to haue their heares long and yellowe, and to weare their waſtes high: and ſtreight. And as the Niece of <hi>Quintus Marcius</hi> was great &amp; bigge with child, the day that the peace was made betwene <hi>Quintus Marcius,</hi> &amp; Rome, lacinge her ſelfe to hard in her attire, to ſeme more proper &amp; comely, ſhe long before her time was delyuered of a creature: &amp; the caſe was ſo woful &amp; vnfortunate, that the creature deliuered dyed: the mother loſt her lyfe, and the mother loſyng her lyfe, ſodainlye her graundmother fel dead to the ground, through which occaſion al the ioy and mirth was turned into ſorow &amp; ſadnes. For it is commenly ſene, when the world is in the greateſt ioy, then fortune ſodainly turneth it into ſorow. The aucthors hereof are <hi>Tibulus</hi> and <hi>Porphirius</hi> both Grecians.</p>

                     <p>THe warres of <hi>Tarent</hi> being ended, immedyatly begonne the warres of <hi>Carthage,</hi> of whych ſo long &amp; tedious warres, the poſſeſſion of the Iſles of <hi>Maiorica,</hi> &amp; <hi>Minorica</hi> were occaſion, forſomuch as the one would take it, and the other defend it. This warre endured wel nyghe the ſpace of 40. yeres, for oft tymes the waſtes and domages which are done in the warres are greater: then the profite, for which they contend. The firſt captayne in this warre of the Romaines was <hi>Gaius Duellus,</hi> and the fyrſt of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens</hi> was <hi>Hammon,</hi> the whych wyth their ſhyppes fought on the ſea of <hi>Sicili,</hi> the whych was very cruel: for there they feared both the fury of the ſea, and alſo the cruelty of the pike, the which two things put mans life in great dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Of thys cruel battaile the Romaine captaine remayned victorious, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he drowned 14 ſhippes, and toke other 30. he ſlew. 3. thouſande men, and brought 3. thouſand <hi>Carthaginiens</hi> pryſoners: and thys was the firſt victory that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaynes had by ſea. And that that the Romaynes moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyſed at was, that by ſea alſo they remained conquerers. The captaine <hi>Gaius Duellus</hi> departyng from <hi>Sicili</hi> came to Rome, wher he had a ſiſter no leſſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, then rych and beautifull, in whoſe houſe he lodged, where he made a coſtly ſupper to al the ſenatours of Rome, &amp; to al the captaines whiche came wyth hym from the warres: for the vicious men knew not wherin to ſhew their loue to their frendes, but by inuiting them to coſtly bankettes. The ſiſter of the captaine <hi>Gaius Duellus,</hi> for ioye of his comming, and for the pleaſure of the banquet &amp; feaſt which was made in her houſe, did eate more then ſhe was accuſtomed, &amp; alſo more then it behoued one in her caſe, ſo that

in the preſence of al ſhe began to annoy the bidden geſtes: for ſhe not onely vomited out the meate of her ſtomake, but alſo the bloud of her vaines, and therwithal moſt vnluckely brought forth her fruite, which ſhe had in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes, wherwith immediatly after the ſoule departed from the body, and ſo died. Truly this caſe was no leſſe lamentable, then the others, for ſo much as <hi>Gaius</hi> loſt his ſiſter, the huſband loſt his wife &amp; his child, &amp; the wife &amp; the child loſt their liues: and for that that Rome loſt ſo noble and excellent a Roman, &amp; aboue al for that it ſo chaunced in ſuch a time of ſo great ioy and pleaſure. For there can come no vnluckier newes, then in the time of much mirth to heare tel of any great miſchaunce. Of this matter mention is made in <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> in the booke of the declination of the Empire. The ſecond warre of <hi>Afrike</hi> which was betwene Rome and <hi>Carthage,</hi> was the. 540. yeres after the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Rome, wherin were captaines <hi>Paulus Emilius,</hi> and <hi>Publius Varro:</hi> the which two conſulles fought the great and famous battaile of <hi>Cannas</hi> in the prouince of <hi>Apulia,</hi> I ſay famous, becauſe Rome neuer loſt ſuch nobilitie and Roman youth, as ſhe loſt in that day. Of theſe two cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſulles, <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi> in the battaile was ſlaine, and <hi>Publius Varro</hi> ouercome, and the couragious <hi>Hannibal</hi> remained conquerour of the field, wherin died .xxx. ſenatours, and 300. officers of the ſenate, and aboue .xl. thouſand fotemen, &amp; thre thouſand horſemen, finally the end of al the Romain people had bene that day, if <hi>Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> had had the wit to haue folowed ſo noble a victory, as he had the corage to giue ſo cruel a battaile. A litle before that <hi>Publius Varro</hi> departed to goe to the warres, he was maried to a faire &amp; young Romain called <hi>Sophia,</hi> &amp; with in ſeuen monethes ſhe was quicke: &amp; as newes was brought her that <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi> was dead, &amp; her huſband ouercome, ſhe died ſodenly, the creature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining aliue in her body. This caſe aboue al was very pitiful, in that that after he him ſelfe was vanquiſhed, &amp; that he had ſene his compaignion the conſul <hi>Emilius</hi> ſlaine, with ſo great a numbre of the Romaine people, fortune would that with his owne eies he ſhould beholde the intrailes of his wife cut to take out the child, &amp; likewiſe to ſe the earth opened, to bury his wyfe. <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Publius Varro</hi> remained ſo ſorowful in his harte, to ſee him ſelf ouercome of his enemies, &amp; to ſee his wife ſo ſodainly &amp; ſo vnluckely ſtrike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with death, that al the time that his life endured, he neither comed his beard, ſlept in bed, nor dined at the table: &amp; hereat we ought not to marueile, for a man in his hart may ſo be wounded in one houre, that he ſhal neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce all the daies of his life. If we put no doubtes in <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains had long &amp; tedious warres againſt the <hi>Samnites,</hi> which indured for the ſpace of .lxiii. yeres continually, vntill ſuche time as the conſull <hi>Ancus Rutillus</hi> (which was a vertuous man) did ſet a good appointment of peace betwene the <hi>Samnites</hi> &amp; the Romains: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble &amp; ſtout harts ought always by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to bring their enemies to peace. Theſe warres therefore being ſo cruell, &amp; obſtinate <hi>Titus Venurius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Spurius Poſthumius</hi> (which were Romain captains) were ouercom by <hi>Pontius</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valiant captain of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Samnites:</hi> who after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victory did a thing neuer ſene nor hard of before. That is to wete, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romain pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners whom he toke, he put about their necks a yoke, wherin were written theſe wordes. <hi>In ſpighte of Rome, the Romaines ſhalbe ſubiect to the yoke of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites.</hi> Wherwith in dede the Romains were greatly iniuried, wherfore they ſought ſtoutly to be reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged of the <hi>Samnites:</hi> for the hartes that are haughty,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:121"/>
and proud, cannot ſuffer that others haue their mindes lofty and high. The Romaines therfore created to be captaine of the warre, one named <hi>Lucius Papirius,</hi> who had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to go againſt the <hi>Samnites.</hi> This <hi>Lucius</hi> was more fortunate in his doinges, then comly of his perſone, for he was deformed of his face, notwithſtanding he did ſo good ſeruice in the warre, &amp; fortune fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured him ſo wel, that he did not onely ouercome &amp; vanquiſhe, but alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied them: and though the iniury which the <hi>Samnites</hi> did to the Romains was great, yet truly the iniury which the Romains did to the <hi>Samnites</hi> was much greater. For fortune is ſo variable, that thoſe which yeſterday we ſaw in moſt proſperitie, to day we ſee in greateſt aduerſitie. This <hi>Lucius Papirius</hi> therfore did not only vanquiſhe the <hi>Samnites,</hi> kept them priſoners, and made yokes for their neckes: but alſo bounde them with cordes together, in ſuche ſorte, that they made them plough the grounde, drawing twoo and twoo a plough. And yet not herewith contented, but with gaddes they pricked and tormented them. If the <hi>Samnites</hi> had had pitie of the Romains being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, the Romaines likewiſe would haue taken compaſſion of them when they were conquerers. And therefore the proſperous haue as muche nede of good councel, as the miſerable haue nede of remedy. For the man whiche is not mercifull in his proſperitie, ought not to meruaile though he finde no frendes in his neceſſitie. This <hi>Lucius Papirius</hi> had a doughter maried to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour of Rome, who was called <hi>Torquatus,</hi> and ſhe was called <hi>Ypolita.</hi> And about the time that ſhe ſhold haue bene deliuered, ſhe went foorth to receiue her father, the which ſhe ought not to haue done: for the throng of the people in receiuing him being great, &amp; ſhe her ſelfe being great with childe, by a heuy chaunce, as ſhe would haue paſſed in at a narrowe gate, ſhe was ſo preſte in the throng, that ſhe chaunged her life for death, &amp; her father turned his mirth &amp; ioy, into ſorow &amp; ſadnes. For he toke the death of his doughter very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely, &amp; ſo much the more becauſe it was ſo ſodeine. I ſay he tooke it heauily, ſince he was ſo ſtoute a man, &amp; ſo ſage withal, that al Rome thought muche that any ſuch ſodaine chaunce ſhould haue diſmaied ſo wiſe a man, that of his wiſedome he could take no profite: but hereat let no man marueile, for there are many that hath hartes to ſhed the bloud of their enemies, &amp; yet can not withhold the teares of their eies. <hi>Annius Seuerus</hi> in the third booke <hi>De in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felice fortuna</hi> ſaith, that the day that this woful miſhap chaunced to <hi>Lucius Pa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pirius,</hi> he lift vp his eies to the heauens, &amp; weping ſaid. O fortune, deceiuoure of all mortall men, thou madeſt me to conquere in warre, to thintent thou wouldeſt ouercome me in peace. My mynde was to declare vnto you all theſe auncient hiſtories, to the end all may knowe, how tender and delicate women with childe are, and howe diligent their huſbandes ought to be to preſerue them: ſince there is nothing ſo tender to be kept, nor any glaſſe ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to be broken. For there is much glaſſe, that though it fall to the grounde, yet it doth not breake: but a woman with childe, only for treading her foote a wry, we ſee with daunger to be deliuered.</p>

                     <p>IF we vnderſtand the chapter before, we ſhal finde that wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with child haue bene in great daungers, ſome through leaping, ſome by dauncing, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21411:121"/>
by eatinge, others by banquetinge, others through gaddinge, other by ſtraight lacing, &amp; al this proceadeth through their owne follies, that ſeeketh to be deſtroyers of their own bodies. Truly herein princeſſes &amp; great ladies are worthy of great rebuke, when through their owne follies they are not ſafely deliuered of their creatures. And I would gladly they toke example, not only of reaſonable men, but alſo of brute beaſtes: for there is no beaſte ſo brute in the wylde mountaines, but eſcheweth that which to his life &amp; death wilbe hurtful. The Beares, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lioneſſe, &amp; the wolles, neuer iſſue our of their caues &amp; dennes ſo long as they be bigge, &amp; this they do to auoide the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the hunters, becauſe at that time they woulde not be courſed. Then ſince theſe thinges are done by brute beaſtes (whoſe yonglinges are always hurtful to men) to thintent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their gredy whealpes might ſafely be brought forth, to deuour our innocent cattel: how much more then ought the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be careful for her fruite, which is the increaſe of Chriſtian congregation? If women brought not forth, and children were not borne, though there be earth, yet there ſhould be none to people it: for god created al things to ſerue the creature, &amp; created the creatures to ſerue their creator. Let women with child take example by the cheſſenuttes and walnuttes, howe &amp; in what ſorte they defende their fruite after that of their bloſomes they are depriued: for the cheſſenut tree defendeth his fruite with a rough &amp; hard huſke, &amp; the wal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nut kepeth her fruite with a thicke ſhale in like maner, ſo that the water can not wette them, nor the wynde ſhake them. Nowe ſince that the trees whiche haue but a vegetatiue lief, and the beaſtes a ſenſitiue lief, take ſuche hede to them ſelues when they feele them ready to bryng foorth their fruite: much more women with childe ought to take hede to them ſelues, ſince they haue reaſon and vnderſtanding, leaſt through their negligence the creature ſhould periſh. Let euery man iudge how litle he looſeth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he looſeth nuts and cheſſenuts: and for the contrary let euery man iudge what the churche looſeth, when the woman with child do not bring forth their fruite, into the light of baptiſme. For our mother the holy churche bewayleth not for that the vines are froſen: but for the ſoules whiche are loſt. To the ende that the man may ſee the fruitfull bleſſing whiche he deſireth, and that the woman with child may ſee her ſelf wel deliuered: the huſband ought to beware that he enforceth her not much to labour, and the woman likewiſe ought to be circumſpect that ſhe take not to muche idlenes. For in women with childe this is a general rule, that to much traueile cauſeth them before their time to deliuer: &amp; to much idlenes putteth them in daunger. The man is cruell that wil haue his wife trauaile &amp; take as muche paines when ſhe is bigge, as he would haue her at an other time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe is not with child: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man which is clothed, can not runne ſo ſwift, as he that is naked. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſixt booke <hi>de Animalibus</hi> ſaith, when the Lioneſſe is bigge with whelpe, the Lyon doth not only hunt for her him ſelf: but alſo both night &amp; daye he wandreth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually about to watche her. I meane, that princeſſes &amp; great Ladies when they be with child, ſhould be of their huſbandes both tended &amp; ſerued: for the man can not do the woman ſo great a pleaſure before her lieng down, as ſhe doth to him when ſhe bringeth forth a ſonne. Conſidering the daunger that the woman abideth in her deliuerance, &amp; beholding the paines that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb facs="tcp:21411:122"/>
taketh in her ſeruice: without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon that is greater which ſhe ſuffereth, then that which he endureth. For when the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deliuereth, ſhe doth more then her power: and the huſband though he ſerueth her well, doth leſſe then his dutie. The gentle and louing huſband ought not one moment to forſake his wife, ſpecially when he ſeeth ſhe is great: for in the law of a good huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it is written, that he ſhould ſet his eies to behold her, his handes to ſerue her, he ſhould ſpende his goods to cheriſhe her, &amp; ſhould geue his harte to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent her. Let not men thinke it paines to ſerue their wiues when they are with childe: for their labour conſiſteth in their ſtrengthe, but the trauell of their wiues is in their intrailes. And that whiche is moſte pitifull is, that when the ſorowfull women will diſcharge their burden on the earthe, they often times bryng them ſelues vnto the graue. The meane women of the <hi>Plebeians</hi> ought no leſſe to be reproued, for that when they are with childe, they would be exempted from all buſines of the houſe: the whiche neither they them ſelues ought to deſire, nor yet their huſbandes to ſuffer. For idleneſſe is not only an occaſion not to deſerue heauen: but alſo it is a cauſe whereby wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ofte times haue ill ſucceſſe in their trauaile. For conſidering bothe the deintie Ladie with childe, that hath her pleaſure, and doth litle, and on the other ſide the poore mans wyfe whiche moderatly laboureth: you ſhall ſee that the great Ladies for all their pleaſures abydeth more daunger, then the other doth with all her labour. The huſbande ought to keape his wyfe from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng to muche paines, for ſo ought he to doe: and the wyfe lykewyſe ought to flee to much pleaſure, for it behoueth her. For the meane trauaile is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but occaſion of a ſafe deliuerie. The women with childe alſo ought to take hede to them ſelues, and in eſpecially noble and great ladies, that they be not to gredy nor haſty in eating. For the woman being with childe ought to be ſobre: and the woman whiche is a great eater, with great paines ſhall liue chaſte. Women with childe ofte times doe diſordre them ſelues in eating licorous meates, and vnder the colour of feedinge them ſelues and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, they take to exceſſiuely: which is not onely vnholſome for the childe, but alſo diſhonour for their mothers. For truly by the great exceſſe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (being with child) commeth many diſeaſes to the infant when it liueth. The huſbandes alſo ought neither to diſpleaſe nor greue their wiues, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when thei ſee them great with child: for of truth ofte times ſhe deliuereth with more daunger, by reaſon of the offences that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do vnto them: then by the abondaunce of meates which they doe eate. Though the woman when ſhe is with childe, in ſome thinges doth offend her huſband, yet he like a wiſe man ought to forbeare her, hauing reſpect to the child wherwith ſhe is great and not to the iniurie that ſhe hath committed: for in thend, the mother can not be ſo great an offender, but that the childe is muche more innocent. For the profe of this, it neadeth not bookes to reade, but only our eies to ſee: how the brute beaſtes for the moſte parte (when the females are bigge) doe not touche them, nor yet the females ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be touched. I meane, that the noble and high eſtates ought to abſent them ſelues from their wiues car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, beyng great with child: and he that in this caſe ſhal ſhewe him ſelfe moſte temperate, ſhall of all men be deamed moſt vertuous. I do not ſpeake this to thend it ſhould bind a man, or that it were an offence then to vſe the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21411:122"/>
company of his wyfe: but vnto men that are vertuous I geue it as a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. For ſome things ought to be done of neceſſitie, &amp; others ought to be eſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed for honeſtie. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſaith, that in the realme of <hi>Mauritania</hi> there were ſo few men, &amp; ſo many women, that euery man had fiue wiues, where there was a law amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt them, that no man ſhould mary vnder thre wiues: furthermore they had a wonderful &amp; foliſhe cuſtome, that when any huſband died, one of theſe women ſhould caſt her ſelfe quick in to the graue &amp; be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him. And if that within a moneth ſhe did it not, or that ſhe died not, by iuſtice ſhe was then openly put to death: ſaiyng that it is more hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie to be in company with her huſband in the graue, then it is to be alone in her houſe. In the Iſles of <hi>Baliares</hi> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary is ſene, for there increaſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, and ſo few women, that for one woman there was ſeuen men: and ſo they had a cuſtome, ſpecially amongeſt the poore, that one woman ſhould be maried with fiue men. For the ryche men ſent to ſeke for women in other ſtraunge Realmes, wherfore then marchauntes came heuie loden with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as now they do with marchaundiſe to ſell. Vpon which occaſion there was a cuſtome in thoſe Iſles, that (for as muche as there were ſo fewe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) when any woman with chylde drewe nere the ſeuen monethes, they were ſeperated from their huſbandes, and ſhut and locked vp in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, where they gaue them ſuche thinges as were neceſſary for them of the commen treaſure. For the auncientes had their goodes in ſuche veneration, that they would not permitte any perſonne to eate that whiche he brought: but of that whiche vnto the goddes of the Temple was offered. At that tyme the <hi>Barbarous</hi> kepte their wyues locked in the churche, becauſe the gods hauing them in their Temples, ſhould be more mercifull vnto them in their deliuery, and alſo to cauſe them to auoyde the daungers at that tyme: and beſydes that, becauſe they tooke it for a great vilany, that the women during that tyme ſhould remaine with their huſbandes. The famous and renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med philoſopher <hi>Pulio,</hi> in the fift booke <hi>De moribus antiquorum</hi> ſaid, that in the Realme of <hi>Paunonia</hi> (whiche nowe is Hongarie) the women that were great with childe were ſo highly eſtemed, that when any went out of her houſe, al thoſe which met with her, were bounde to returne backe with her, &amp; in ſuch ſorte as we at this preſent do reuerence the holy Comunion, ſo did theſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous</hi> then the women with child. The women of <hi>Carthage</hi> being with child (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Carthage</hi> was <hi>Carthage</hi>) had as great priuileges, as now our ſanctuaries haue for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſafegard of miſdoers: for in times paſt, al ſuch offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dours as could enter into the houſe wher a woman lay in child bed, ſhould haue ben free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> correction of iuſtice. As <hi>Fronto</hi> ſaith, in his booke of the veneration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods, the <hi>Galloys Tranſalpins,</hi> did not only honour &amp; reuerence y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with child, but alſo with much care &amp; diligence watched her deliuery: for it litle auaileth the ſhippe to haue paſſed ſafe the daungerous ſeas, if at the ſhore ſhe be caſt away. The caſe was in this ſort, that al the auncient gentils honoured ſome gods in their temples, &amp; kept other in their houſes, the which were called <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> &amp; <hi>Penates:</hi> &amp; when any woman began to labour, eche neighbour brought his familiar god vnto her to preſent her with all, becauſe they thought that the more gods there were, of ſo much more power they were to kepe her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perils. Speaking like a chriſtian, truly thoſe gods were of ſmall value, ſince

                     <head>¶ What the Philoſopher <hi>Piſto</hi> was, and of the rules he gaue concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning women with childe. Cap. xii.</head>
                     <p>IN the tyme of <hi>Octauian</hi> the Emperour, was a phyloſopher called <hi>Piſto,</hi> whiche was of the ſecte of <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> and when Rome floriſhed, he was very familiar with the Emperour <hi>Octauian,</hi> and welbeloued of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whiche ought not to be a litle eſtemed: for he which of the prince is moſt fauoured, commonly of the people is moſte hated. This Emperour <hi>Octauian</hi> was a prince very deſirous of all vertuous thinges, ſo that when he dyned with his captaines, he ſpake of warre, when he ſupped with the ſages, he rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoned of ſciences, and he that vttered any diſhoneſt or idle worde in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he alwayes afterward toke him as his enemy. This <hi>Piſto</hi> was very graue in weightie affaires, very pleaſaunt in ſlentes and ieſtes, &amp; ofte times he was demaunded many queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Emperour, whereof the anſwers of ſome (according to the demaundes and queſtions) here foloweth.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour ſaid to <hi>Piſto,</hi> of all theſe that liueth, whom takeſt thou to be moſte foole? to whom the Philoſopher aunſwered. In my opinion I take him to be moſte foole, of whoſe worde there commeth no profite: for truly he is not ſo very a foole that ſlingeth ſtones into the winde, as he that vttereth vayne wordes.</p>
                     <p>Tell me <hi>Piſto,</hi> whom ought we of right to deſire to ſpeake, and whom of right to commaunde to be ſilent? he aunſwered. It is good when ſpeache doth profite, and good to kepe ſilence, when ſpeache is hurtfull: for the one deſiring to mainteine the good, and the other to defende the euil, warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne throughout all the worlde.</p>
                     <p>Tell me <hi>Piſto,</hi> from what thing ought the fathers moſte to kepe their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? he ſayd. In my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> parentes ought in nothing to watche ſo much, as to kepe them from being vicious: for the father ought rather to haue his ſonne die well, then to liue euill.</p>
                     <p>Tell me <hi>Piſto,</hi> what ſhall man do if he be brought to this extremitie? that if he ſpeake truthe, he condempneth him ſelfe: and if he make a lie, he ſaueth him ſelfe. The vertuous man (ſaide he) ought rather to choſe to be ouercome by truthe, then to ouercome by lies: for it is vnpoſſible that a man which is a lier, ſhould continue long in proſperitie.</p>
                     <p>Tell me <hi>Piſto,</hi> what ſhall man doe to obtaine reſte? he aunſwered. As I thinke the man can not haue reſte, vnleſſe he forſake worldly affaires: for the menne that are occupied with weightie affaires, can not be without great cares are alwayes accompanied of great troubles.</p>
                     <p>Tell me <hi>Piſto,</hi> wherein a man ſheweth him ſelfe to be moſt wyſe? he aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. There is no greater profe to knowe a wyſe man, then if he be pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſuffer the ignoraunt: for in ſuffering an iniury, the harte is more holpen by wyſedome, then by knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Tell me <hi>Piſto,</hi> what is that thing that the vertuous man may lawfullye deſire? he aunſwered. All that that is good (ſo that it be not to the preiudice of any other) may honeſtly be deſired: but in my opinion that onely ought to be deſired, whiche openly without ſhame may be demaunded.</p>
                     <p>Tell me <hi>Piſto,</hi> what ſhal men doe with their wiues when they are great
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21411:123"/>
with child, to cauſe that the child in ſafetie may be deliuered? he aunſwered. In the world there is nothyng more perylous, then to haue the charge of a woman with child. For if the huſbande ſerue her, he hath payne &amp; trauaile: and if perchaunce he doe not contente her, ſhe is in daunger.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe, the wiues of Rome and their huſbandes alſo oughte to be very diligent, and to the thinges folowyng more careful: the which I ſhew them more for counſell, then for commaundement. For good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell ought to haue as much auctoritie in the vertuous, as the commaundement hath in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. Thou <hi>Octauian,</hi> as thou arte a mercifull and a pitieful Emperour, and that kepeſt thy Nece <hi>Coſſucia</hi> great with childe, I know thou deſireſt that ſhe had preſentely good and luckye deliuery, and that ſhe were deliuered of her paine: all the whyche thou ſhalte ſee, if thou doeſt marke theſe thynges that I will ſhew the here folowynge.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the woman oughte to beware of dauncing, leapinge, and running: for leaping oftentimes maketh man to looſe his ſpeache, and women with childe to looſe their life, wherfore it is not reaſon that the folly of the mother ſhould be permitted to put in hazarde the lyfe of the childe.</p>
                     <p>The ſecound, the woman beyng with child ought to beware that ſhe be not ſo hardye to enter into gardeyns, wher there is much frute, and that for eating to many ſhe be not yll deliuered: for it is no reaſon that the likerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the mother, be puniſhed with the death of the childe.</p>
                     <p>The third, the woman with child ought to beware of ouer harde lacing herſelfe about the midle: for many Roman Dames for to ſeme propre, doe weare their gownes ſo ſtreighte, that it is an occaſion to kyll their creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: which is a heynous mater, that the yonge babe ſhould looſe hys lyfe, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his mother ſhoulde ſeme pretye.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, the women with child ought to beware of eating in a great banket: for oftetimes there commeth a ſodayne deliueraunce, only through eating without meaſure, and it is not mete that for taſtinge a thyng of litell value, the mother and the child ſhould both looſe their liues.</p>
                     <p>The fifte, the woman beyng with child ought to beware that ſhe giueth no eare to any ſodayne newes: For ſhe is in more daunger for hearynge a thing that greueth her, then for ſuffering long ſicknes that paineth her: and it were vniuſt that for knowing of a trifeling matter, the mother that is to be deliuered, &amp; the child that is to be borne, ſhould both in one mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t periſh.</p>
                     <p>The ſixte, the woman with child ought to beware that ſhe go not by any meanes to any feaſtes, wher ther ſhalbe any greate aſſembly of people: for oft times the woman with child, ſeyng her to be to much thruſt and preaſt, beyng not able to ſay I am here, may immediatly dye in the place, and it is not reaſon, but an vniuſt thing, that the woman for the deſire to ſee the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of others, ſhould make of her owne orphanes.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth, the huſband oughte to beware that ſhe being with child, be not denayed any honeſt thing that ſhe do minde: for in graunting her it can not coſt him moche, but in denieng her he may looſe much, and it ſhould not be iuſt, that ſince in her bringing forth ſhe honoreth and increaſeth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wealth of Rome, that Rome ſhould condeſcend that any woman with childe ſhould receyue any hurte or diſhonour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:124"/>Theſe be the aunſwers that <hi>Piſto</hi> made to the Emperour <hi>Octauian,</hi> the which he gaue as rules to women with child, whiche beyng ſo kept, I doe aſſure you that the great Ladies ſhoulde deliuer them ſelues from many perilles, and the huſbandes alſo ſhould eſcape from many ſorowes. Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therfore that which aboue is ſpoken I ſaye, that princeſſes and greate ladies, when they are with child, ought to bee more ware and circumſpect then other meane women: for where man hopeth to haue moſt profit, there oughte he moſt to be carefull. The auctour of this is <hi>Pulio</hi> in his third boke <hi>De moribus antiquorum</hi> and <hi>ſextus. Cheronenſis</hi> in his .5. booke <hi>de legibus domeſticis</hi>

                     <head>Of thre counſelles which <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> gaue vnto a ſecretary his frend, who ſerued the Emperour <hi>Nero:</hi> and how the Emperour <hi>Marke Aureille</hi> diſpoſed all the howers of the daye. Chap. xiii.</head>
                     <p>THe Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> had a Secretary called <hi>Emilius Varro,</hi> the whyche beyng in Rome builded a ſumptuous houſe ioyning vnto the gate of <hi>Salaria,</hi> wherunto he inuited one daye <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> to a banquet, to the end the houſe might be more fortunate: for the Romains had a Prophecye, that accordyng to the good or yll lucke of him that firſt entred into a newe houſe, ſo ſhould it continually be luckye, or vnlucky. <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> graunted to the requeſt of his frende <hi>Emilius Varro:</hi> and when they had well eaten, they went both to ſee this new building, ſhewyng vnto <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> all thinges, at the laſte the Secretary ſayd thus vnto <hi>Seneca.</hi> Thoſe betwene both are for geſtes, thoſe haulles are for marchauntes and ſuetors, theſe ſecrettes are for women, thoſe chambers are for knightes, thoſe galleries which are coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red are to auoyde the ſonne, this loweſt part here is for horſes, the Cellers are for the buttry: in the end he ſhewed him the whole houſe, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> furniſhing wherof there lacked not one iotte. After the Secretarye <hi>Emilius Varro</hi> had ſhewed him all his houſe, he loked when his geſt <hi>Seneca</hi> would greatly prayſe and commend it, but he as though he knew nothing, ſayd vnto <hi>Emilius Varro</hi> as he went out of the dores, whoſe houſe is this? wherunto <hi>Emillius</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, how now <hi>Seneca</hi> canſt not thou tel? I haue employed all my goodes in buildyng this houſe, and haue led the all about to ſee it, and I haue tolde the that it is mine, &amp; yet doeſt thou aſke me againe whoſe it is? <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> aunſwered. Thou haſte ſhewed vs the houſe for ſtraungers, the houſe for ſlaues, the houſe for women, the houſe for horſes, and in all this houſe thou haſt not ſhewed me one litel part for thy ſelf, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an other man doth enter into it: for if thou haſt any intereſt therin, they haue the beſt therof, whiche is the poſſeſſion. I accompt the a wiſe man, I doe accompt the a man of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and alſo I know that withal thy hart thou art my frende: and ſince I haue bene bydden to day by the it is but reaſon, that for to rewarde that whych thou haſt done to me, I do ſome ſeruice vnto the, whych ſhal be to giue vnto the ſome good counſel. For ſtraungers vſe to pay for the feaſt with money, &amp; vaine men with telling lies, bablers by counting vaine tales, childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by flatteries: but vertuous men ought to pay, bygening good counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. This houſe hath coſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> much paine, great griefes, &amp; much money, and if it coſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo much, it is but reaſon that thou inioy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. Take therfore theſe my thre counſelles, &amp; it may be thou wilte finde thy ſelfe better contented with thoſe, then with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> money of ſtraungers: for many haue wherwithal to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21411:124"/>
builde a houſe, but they haue not vnderſtandyng to gouerne the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The firſt counſell is, though that thou loue thy frende verye well, or thy wife aſwell, yet that thou neuer diſcouer all the ſecrettes of thy harte, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to thy frende, nor to thy wyfe: But that thou always reſerue ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler vnto thy ſelfe. For <hi>Plato</hi> ſayeth, to whom a man committeth his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crettes, to him alſo he giueth his libertie.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond counſell is, that neyther in priuate buſines, nor in publicke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires thou occupye thy ſelfe ſo much, but at the leaſt thou do reſerue .3. hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in the day for thine owne reſte.</p>
                     <p>The third councel is, that thou haue in thy houſe ſome ſecret place, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou alone ſhalt haue the key: and therein thou ſhalte haue bookes, wher thou maieſt ſtudy of thy affaires, and alſo talke with thy frendes. Finallye, this place ſhalbe a ſecretory of thy counſelles, and a reſt for thy trauelles. Theſe were the wordes that <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> ſpake to his frende <hi>Emilius Varro,</hi> whiche wordes were ſuch as he him ſelfe was, that is to wete, of a ſage and excellent perſonnage: and thoughe the banquet was riche, yet the paymente of <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> was much more worth. For the minde feleth more taſt in the good and rype counſell: then the bodie doth in ſauory and delicate meates. I haue tolde you this example of <hi>Lucius Seneca,</hi> for to tell an other that happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> with his wiſe <hi>Fauſtine.</hi> And to the end that the order of the matter be not tourned without breaking our Hiſtorye, firſt we will declare here the order whiche this Emperour obſerued in hys lyfe. For the commen wealth ſhall neuer be well gouerned, but where the prince gouerneth well his lyfe.</p>
                     <p>Princes of neceſſitie ought to be wel ordered in their life, becauſe they may profite the affaires of the Empire, with the perticulers of their houſe, and be cauſe they ſhould vſe the perticulers of their houſe, to the recreacion of their perſonne: and all theſe thinges ought to be deuided accordyng to time. For a good prince ought to lacke no time to do that thinge well which he hath to do: nor he oughte to haue any tyme vacant to employe him ſelfe to vice. The worldly call that time good, the which is, or was proſperous vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they call that time eull, which is, or hath bene contrary and vnfortunat vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, The Creator wil neuer that this ſentence be approued by my penne: but I call that time good, which is imployed in vertues, and that time euill, that is loſt in vices. For the times are alwayes as one, but men do tourne from vice to vertue, from vertue to vice. The good Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> did deuid the time, by time: ſo that though he had time for him ſelfe, he had time lykewiſe to diſpatche his owne and others affaires: for the man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is willing, in a ſmall time diſpatcheth much buſynes: &amp; the man which is necligent, in a longe tyme doth lytel. This was the order that the Emperour <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi> toke in ſpendyng his time. He ſlepte .7. houres in the nighte, and one hower reaſted hym ſelfe in the day. In dyning and ſuppynge he conſumed onely .2. howers: and it was not for that he toke great pleaſure to be longe in eatinge, but bycauſe the philoſophers whyche diſputed before his preſence, were occaſion to prolonge the time. For in .17. yeares they neauer ſaw hym at meate, but one or other redde vnto him ſome booke, or elles the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers reaſoned before hym philophye. As he hadde manye realmes and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:125"/>
prouinces, ſo he appointed one hower for the affaires of <hi>Aſia,</hi> for <hi>Affryke</hi> one hower, and for <hi>Europe</hi> another hower, and for the conuerſacion of his wife, children, and family, he appointed other .2. howers of time: he had another hower for extraordinary affaires, as to here the complaintes of the greued, the quarrelles of the poore, the complaintes of the widowes, and the robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done to the orphanes. For the mercifull prince geueth no leſſe eare vnto the poore, which for want can doe lytell: then to the riche, which for aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance can do much. He occupyed all the reſidew of the day and night to rede bokes, write workes, to make meter, and in ſtudyng of other antiquities, to practyſe with the ſage, and to dyſpute with the philoſophers: and fynally he toke no taſt of any thing ſo muche, as he dyd to talke of ſcience: Vnleſſe the cruell warres dyd let hym, or ſuche lyke affaires troubled him: ordynarily in winter he went to bed at .9. of the clocke, and awaked at .4. and bycauſe he would not be idle, he had alway a boke vnder his beddes hed, and the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day he beſtowed in readyng. The romans had an auncient cuſtome to beare fyer before them, that is to wete, a torche lyghte in the daye, and a lampe burnyng in the night in their chambers, ſo that wakyng they burned waxe, and fleapyng they hourned oyle. And the cauſe why the Romans or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned that the oyle ſhould be made of olyue, and the waxe made of bees (which was vſed to be borne before the princes) was to the end they ſhould remember, that they ought to be as gentell and louing, as the oyle of Olyue is ſwete: and as profytable to the common wealth, as the Bees are. He did riſe at .6. of the clocke, and made him ſelfe ready openlye, and with a gentle countenaunce he aſked them that were about hym, wherin they had ſpente all the nyght, and declared vnto them then what he had dreamed, what he had thought, and what he had red: when he was readye, he waſhed his face with odiferous waters, and loued veray wel ſwete ſauoures. For he had ſo quycke a ſent, that he was much offended when he paſſed by any ſtincking place. In the mornyng he vſed to eate .2. morſels of a lectuary made of <hi>Stica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.</hi> and dranke .3. ſponefulls of malueſey, or els two droppes of <hi>Aqua Vite,</hi> by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had a colde ſtomacke, for that he gaue hym ſelfe ſo muche to ſtudye in tymes paſt. We ſe it by experience, that the greate ſtudentes are perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more with ſycknes, then any others: for in the ſwetenes of the ſcyence, they knowe not how their lyfe conſumeth. If it were in the ſommer ſeaſon, he went in the mornyng to recreate him ſelfe to the ryuer of <hi>Tiber,</hi> and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked there a fote for .2. howers, and in this place they talked with hym that had buſines: and trulye it was a great policie, for wher as the Prince doeth not ſyt, the ſewtour alwayes abridgeth his talke, And when the day began to wax hot, he went to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hight capitol where al the Senate taried for him, &amp; from thence he went to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Coliſeo,</hi> wher the imbaſſadours of the prouinces wer, &amp; there remained a great part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day: afterwardes he went to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pel of the veſtal virgines, &amp; ther he hard euery nation by it ſelfe, accordyng to the order which was preſcribed. He dyd eate but one meale in the daye, &amp; it was veray late, but he did eate wel: not of many &amp; diuers ſortes of meates, but of fewe and good. For the aboundaunce of diuerſe and ſtraunge meates breadeth ſondry dyſſeaſes. They ſawe him once a weke go thoroughe Rome, and if he wente anye more it was a wonder: at the whyche tyme he was
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21411:125"/>
alwayes without companie, both of his owne, and alſo of ſtraungers, to thentente all poore men myghte talke with him of their buſines, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of his officers: for it is vnpoſſible to reforme the common wealthe, if he which ought to remedy it, be not informed of the iniuryes done in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame? He was ſo gentle in conuerſacion, ſo pleaſaunt in wordes, ſo noble amongeſt the great, ſo equall with the leaſt, ſo reaſonable in that he dyd aſke, ſo perſyte in that he dyd worke, ſo patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in iniuries, ſo thankefull of benefittes, ſo good to the good, and ſo ſeuere to the euill: that all loued him for beyng good, and all the euill feared him for being iuſte? A man oughte not lytell to eſteme the loue that the people bare to this ſo good a Prince, and noble Emperour, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as the Romans haue bene thus: that for the felicitye of their eſtate, they offered to their gods greater ſacryfyce, then they dyd in any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces. And <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſayeth, that the Romains offered more ſacrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods, becauſe they ſhould lengthen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyfe of the Emperour, then they dyd offer for the profyte of the common wealthe. Trulye their reaſon was good, for the Prynce that leadeth a good lyfe, is the harte of the common wealthe. But I doe not maruaile that the Emperour was ſo well wylled, and beloued of the Romayn empire, for he had neuer porter to hys chamber, but the .2. howers which he remained with his wyfe <hi>Fauſtine.</hi> Al this beyng paſt, the good Emperour went into his houſe into the ſecreteſt place he had (accordyng to the councel of <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi>) they key whereof he alone had in his cuſtodye, and neuer truſted any man therwith, vntyll the hower of hys death: and then he gaue it to an old auncient man called <hi>Pompeianus,</hi> ſayeng vnto hym theſe wordes. Thou knoweſt ryght wel <hi>Pompeianus,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou beyng baſe, I exalted the to honor. Thou beyng poore. I gaue the riches. Thou being perſecuted, I drewe the to my pallas. I beyng abſente, committed my hole honoure to thy truſt, thou beyng old, I maryed the with my doughter, and doe preſently gyue the this key. Behold that in geuing the it, I giue the my harte &amp; lyfe. For I will thou know, that death greueth me not ſo much, nor the loſſe of my wyfe and children, as that I cannot carye my bookes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the graue. Yf the Gods had geuen me the choyſe, I had rather choſe to be in the graue inuyroned with bookes: then to lyue accompanyed wyth fooles: for if the dead doe rede. I take them to be alyue: but if the lyuing doe not reade, I take them to be deade.</p>
                     <p>Vnder this key which I gyue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>, remayneth many Greke. Hebrue, latine, and Roman bookes, and aboue all vnder this key remayneth al my paynes, ſwet, and trauayles, al my watchinges, and labours, where alſo thou ſhalte fynde bokes by me compyled: ſo that though the wormes of the yearth doe eate my body: yet men ſhall fynde my harte hole amongeſt theſe bokes.</p>
                     <p>Once againe I doe require the, and ſaye that thou oughteſt not a lytell to eſteame the key which I giue the: for wiſe men at the hower of their death, alwayes recommed that whiche they beſt loue, to them which in their liues they haue moſt loued. I doe confeſſe, that in my ſtudie thou ſhalte fynd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges with myne owne hand written and wel ordered: and alſo I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that thou ſhalte find many thinges by me left vnperſit. In this caſe I thinke that though thou couldeſt not wryte them, yet thou ſhalt worke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel notwithſtandynge: and by theſe meanes thou ſhalte get reward of the
<pb facs="tcp:21411:126"/>
Gods for workyng them. Conſyder <hi>Pompeian,</hi> that I haue ben thy lorde, I haue ben thy father in law, I haue bene thy father, I haue bene thy aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and aboue all, that I haue bene thy ſpeciall frend, which is moſt of all: for a man ought to eſteme more a faithful frend, then all the parentes of the world. Therfore in the faith of that frendſhyp I require, that thou kepe this in memory, that euen as I haue recommended to others my wife, my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, my goods, and ryches: So I do leaue vnto the in ſingular recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacion my honoure: For prynces leaue of them ſelues no greater memorye, then by the good learning that they haue wrytten. I haue bene .18. yeares emperour of rome, and it is .lx. and .iii. yeares that I haue remayned in thys wofull life, during whiche time I haue ouercome many battailles, I haue ſlayne many pirattes, I haue exalted many good, I haue puniſhed manye euil, I haue wonne many realmes, &amp; I haue diſtroyed many tirauntes. But what ſhal I do, woful man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am, ſithe all my compagnions which were witneſſes with me of al theſe worthy feates, ſhalbe my compagnions in the graue with the gredy wormes? A thouſand yeares hence, when thoſe that are now alyue ſhal then be dead: what is he that ſhal ſay, I ſaw <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi> triumphe ouer the <hi>Parthians,</hi> I ſaw him make the buildings in <hi>Auentino,</hi> I ſaw him welbeloued of the people, I ſaw him father of the orphanes, I ſaw him the ſcourg of tirau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes: truly if al theſe thinges had not ben declared by my bookes, or of my frendes, the dead would neuer haue ryſen agayn to haue declared them. What is it for to ſe a prince (from the time he is borne, vntil the time he come to dye) to ſe the pouerty he paſſeth, the perilles he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth, the euil that he ſuffereth, the ſhame that he dyſſembleth, the frende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp that he fayneth, the teares which he ſheaddeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſighes that he fetchith. the promiſes that he maketh, and doeth not endure for any other cauſe the myſteries of this life: but onely to leaue a memorye of him after his death? There is no prince in the worlde that deſireth not to keape a good houſe, to keape a good table, to aparrel him ſelfe rychely, &amp; to pay thoſe that ſerue hym in his houſe: but by this vaine honour, they ſuffer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water to paſſe thorough their lippes not drinking therof. As one that hath proued it, it is reaſon that I be beloued in this caſe, and that is: that the entent of princes to conquere ſtraunge Realmes, and to permit their owne to ſuffer wronges is for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thyng, but becauſe that the commendacions which they ſpeake of the princes paſt, they ſhould lykewyſe talke the ſame of them that be to come. Concluding therfore my mynde, and declaring my intencion, I ſay that the Prince that is noble, and deſireth to leaue of him ſelfe ſome fame, let hym conſider and ſe what it is that thoſe can write of him, which writ his hiſtory: for it profiteth litel that he atchieue greate affayers by the ſwerde, if there be no writer to ſette them fourth with the penne, and afterwardes to exalte them with the tonge.</p>
                     <p>Theſe wordes thus ſpoken by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> he gaue the key of his ſtudye to the honourable old man <hi>Pompeianus,</hi> that toke all the wrytinges, and put them in the high Capitol, where the Romans honored them, as the chriſtians the holye Scriptures: all theſe writynges beſydes many others peryſhed in rome, when by the <hi>Barbarous</hi> it was dyſtroyed. For the <hi>Gothes,</hi> (vtterly to extinguiſhe the name of rome) diſtroyed not onely the

                     <p>VVe Haue declared, howe the Emperoure <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> had his ſtudie in the ſecreteſt place of al the palace, and how that he him ſelfe did kepe the key. It is to be vnderſtande, that he would neuer let his wife, hys children, nor any other of his familier frendes come into it, for he ſaid: I had rather ſuffer that they ſhoulde take from me my treaſoures, then that any man ſhould turne the leaues of my bookes. It chaunced, that on a daye the Empreſſe <hi>Fauſtine</hi> being great with child, importuned the Emperour muche by all the meanes ſhe could, that he would be ſo fauourable vnto her, as to gyue her the key of his ſtudye, and it is no meruaile: for naturallye women diſpiſe that which is geuen them, and luſt forth at that is denayed them, <hi>Fauſtine</hi> inſtantly beſoughte him, not once, but manye times, not onely with fayer wordes, but with aboundaunt teares, alleagynge vnto him theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. I haue requyred the ſondrye tymes, that thou wouldeſt gyue me the key of thy chamber, and thou haſte by ieſtinge made fruſtrate my requeſt, the whych thou (my Lorde) oughte not to haue done, conſyderynge that I am with childe: for oftetimes it chaunceth, that that wherfore the huſbande reioyceth this daye, tomorow he doeth lamente. Thou oughteſt to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that I am that <hi>Fauſtine</hi> the renowmed, the which in thy eyes am the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and of thy tonge haue bene moſt commended, of thy parſon I was beſt beloued, and of thy harte I am moſt deſired: then ſince it is true, that thou haſt me ſo depely in hart, why then doubteſt thou to ſhew me the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges of thy ſtudy? Thou doeſt communicate with me the ſecretes of the empire, and thou hydeſt from me the bokes of thy ſtudy. Thou haſt geuen me thy tender harte of fleſh, and now thou denieſt me thy harde key of yron: now I muſt neades thinke that thy loue was fayned, that thy words were doble, and that thy thoughtes wer others then they ſeamed. For if they had ben otherwiſe, it had ben vnpoſſible thou ſhouldeſt haue denaied me the key that I do aſke the: for where loue is vnfayned, thoughe the requeſte be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilye aſked, yet it is wyllyngly graunted. It is a commen cuſtome, that you men vſe to deceiue vs ſymple women, you preſent vs great gyftes, you gyue many fayre wordes, you make vs faier promyſes, you ſaye you will do mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiles, but in the end you doe nothing but deceiue vs: for we are perſecuted more of you, then of any others. When men in ſuch wyſe importune the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men if the women hadde power to denaye and withſtande, we ſhoulde in ſhorte ſpace brynge ye vnder the yoke, and leade you by the noſes: but when we ſuffer oure ſelues to be ouercome, then you beginne to forſake vs, and deſpiſe vs. Let me therfore (my Lorde) ſee thy chamber, conſyder I am with childe, and that I dye onleſſe I ſee it. If thou doeſt not to doe me plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet do it at the leaſt becauſe I may no more importune the. For if
<pb facs="tcp:21411:127"/>
I come in daunger thoroughe this my longing I ſhall but loſe my lyfe but thou ſhalte looſe the childe that ſhould be borne, and the mother alſo that oughte to beare it. I know not why thou ſhouldeſt put thy noble harte into ſuch a daungerous fortune, whereby both thou and I at one time ſhoulde peryſhe: I in dyeng ſo yong, and thou in loſyng ſo louynge a wyfe.</p>
                     <p>By the immortall gods I do beſeche the, and by the mother <hi>Berecinthia</hi> I coniure the, that thou geue me the key, or that thou let me enter into the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye: and ſtycke not with me thy wyfe in this my ſmall requeſt, but chaunge thy opinion: for all that which without conſideracion is ordeyned, by impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ſewte may be reuoked. We ſee dayly that men by reading in bookes loue their children, but I neauer ſawe harte of man fall in ſuch ſorte, that by readyng and lokyng in bookes he ſhould deſpyſe hys children: for in the end bookes are by the wordes of others made: but children are with their owne proper bloud begotten. Before that any thinge of wyſedom is begon, they alwayes regard the inconuenyences that maye folowe. Therefore if thou wilte not geue me this key, and that thou arte determyned to be ſtoberne ſtill in thy will, thou ſhalt loſe thy <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> thou ſhalte loſe ſo louyng a wyfe, thou ſhalte loſe the creature werwith ſhe is bigge, thou ſhalte loſe the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of thy palace, thou ſhalte geue occaſion to all Rome to ſpeake of the wickednes, and this grefe ſhall neauer departe from thy harte: for the harte ſhall neuer be comforted, that knoweth that he onely is the occaſion of hys owne griefe. Yf the Gods doe ſuffer it by their ſecreate iudgementes, and if my wofull myſhappes deſerue it, and if thou (my Lord) deſireſt it for no other cauſe, but euen to do after thy wil, for denayeng me this key, I ſhould dye: I would wyllingly dye. But of that I thinke thou wilt repente: for it chaunceth oftetymes to wyſemen, that when remedy is gone, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> repentaunce commeth ſodeinlye. And then it is to late (as they ſaye) to ſhutte the ſtable dore, when the ſteade is ſtollen.</p>
                     <p>I marueill much at the my Lorde, why thou ſhouldeſt ſhew thy ſelfe ſo froward in this caſe, ſince thou knoweſt that all the time we haue bene to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gethers, thy wil and myne hath alway bene one, if thou wilte not geue me thy key, for that I am thy welbeloued <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> if thou wilte not let me haue it, ſinſe I am thy deare beloued wyfe, if thou wilte not geue it me, for that I am great with childe. I beſeche the geue it me in vertue of the auncient law. For thou knoweſt it is an inuiolate law among the Romaines, that a man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not denay his wife with child her deſiers. I haue ſene ſondry times with myne eyes, many women ſew their huſbandes at the law in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: and thou Lorde commaundeſt that a man ſhould not breake the pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uileges of women.</p>
                     <p>Then if this thing be true (as it is true in dead) why wilte thou that the lawes of ſtrang children ſhould be kepte, and that they ſhould be broken to thine owne children? Speakyng according to the reuerence that I owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the, thoughe thou wouldeſt, I wil not, thoughe thou doeſt it, I will not agree therunto, and though thou doeſt commaund it, in this caſe I wil not obey the. For if the huſband doe not accept the iuſte requeſt of his wyfe, the wyfe is not bounde to obey the vniuſt commaundement of her huſbande. You huſbandes deſier that your wyues ſhould ſerue you, you deſier that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21411:127"/>
your wiues ſhould obey you in all, and ye will condiſcende to nothing that they deſyer. Ye menne ſaye, that we women haue no certeintie in our loue, but in dead you haue no loue at all. For by this it appeareth, that you loue is fained, in that it no longer continueth then your deſires are ſatiſfyed. You ſaye furdermore, that the women are ſuſpytious, and that is true in you al, men may ſee, and not in vs: for none other cauſe there are ſo manye euell maried in Rome, but bycauſe their huſbandes haue of them ſuche iuell opinions. There is a great dyfference betwene the ſuſpition of the woman, and the ielouſye of the man: for if a man will vnderſtande the ſuſpition of the woman, it is no other thynge, but to ſhewe to her huſbande that ſhe loueth hym with all her hearte. For the innocente women knowe no others, deſire no others but their huſbandes only, and they woulde that their huſbandes ſhould knowe none others, nor ſerche for anye others, nor loue any others, nor will anye others, but them onely: for the hearte that is bente to loue one onely, would not that into that houſe ſhould enter anye other.</p>
                     <p>But you men knowe ſo manye meanes, and vſe ſo manye ſubtelties, that you prayſe youre ſelues for to offende them, you vaunt youre ſelues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, and that it is trewe, a man can in nothynge ſo muche ſhew his noblenes, as to ſuſteyne and fauoure a Cortiſan.</p>
                     <p>The huſbandes pleaſeth their wyues ſpeakynge vnto them ſome merye wordes, and immediately their backes being tourned, to another they geue bothe their bodyes and their good. I ſware vnto the (my Lorde) that if wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had the libertie and aucthoritye ouer men, as men haue ouer women: they ſhould fynde more malice, dyſceiptfulnes, and crafte, by them commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one daye, then they ſhould fynde in the women all the dayes of their lyfe. You men ſaye that women are euill ſpeakers, it is true in dede that youre tonges are none other, but the ſtynges of ſerpentes: for ye doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempne the good men, and defame the Roman women. And thynke not (yf you ſpeake euill of other women) to excuſe your owne: for the man that by his tonge dyſhonereth ſtraunge women, doeth not ſo much iuel, as he doeth by defamyng his owne wyfe by ſuſpytion. For the huſbande that ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith hys wyfe, geueth all men licence to accompt her for noughte. Sythe we women goe lytell oute of the houſe, we trauayle not farre, and ſithe we ſee fewe thinges, thoughe we woulde we cannot be euill tonged: but you menne heare muche, you ſee muche, you know muche, you wander abrode muche, and continually you murmure. All the euill that we ſelye women can do, is to liſten to our frendes when they are vexed, to chide oure ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes when they are necligent, to enuye our neighbours if they be faier, and to curſſe thoſe that doeth vs iniurye: finallye thoughe wee ſpeake euill, we cannot murmure, but at thoſe that dwelleth in the ſame ſtreate where wee dwell. But you menne defame youre wyues by ſuſpition, you dyſhonoure youre neyghbours in youre wordes, you ſpeake agaynſte ſtraungers wyth crueltye, you neyther keape faythe nor promyſe to youre wyues, you ſhewe youre ſelues extreme agaynſte youre enemyes, you murmoure bothe at thoſe that bee preſente, and alſo at them that be abſente: finally on the one parte you are ſo doble, and on the other parte you are ſo vnthankefull, that to thoſe whom you deſire, you make faire
<pb facs="tcp:21411:128"/>
promyſes, &amp; thoſe whoſe bodyes you haue enioyed, you littel eſteame. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that the woman is not ſo good as ſhe oughte to be, and that it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarye that ſhe ſhould be kepte in the houſe, and ſo ſhe ſhall leade a good lyfe, and beyng of good lyfe, ſhe ſhall haue good renowme, and hauing good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme, ſhe ſhalbe wel willed: but if perchaunce any of thoſe do want in her, yet for all that ſhe oughte not to be reiected of her huſbande. For the fraile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that menne finde in women is but litell: but the euils that women taſt in men is veraye great. I haue talked lenger then I thought, and haue ſayed more boldly then I ought, but pardon me (my lord) for mine intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not to vexe the, but to perſwade the. For in the end he is a foole that taketh that for iniury, whiche paſſeth betwene the man and the wyfe in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creat. I ſticke alwayes to my firſt poynt, and if it neade, once againe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the that thou wilte geue me the key of thy ſtudye: &amp; if thou do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (as thou mayſt) thou ſhalt do ſuch a thyng, as thou oughteſt not to doe. I am not angry ſo much for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou doeſt, as for the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou geueſt me.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to auoyde the peril of my deliuery, and to take from me all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition, I praye the (my lorde) deliuer me the key of thy ſtudy: for otherwiſe I cannot be perſwaded in my harte, but that you haue a woman locked in your ſtudy. For men that in their youth haue bene vnconſtant, thoughe the apparell that they haue be not worne: yet notwitſtandynge they deſire to haue new. Therfore once againe to preſerue me from perill in my deliuery, and to lyghten my hart of this thought, it ſhalbe well done that you let me enter into your ſtudie.</p>

Vaine and fooliſh men, by vaine and fooliſh wordes do publiſhe their vaine and light pleaſurs: and the wiſe men, by wiſe wordes doe diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their greauous ſorowes. For though they fele the troubles of this lyfe, they diſſemble them as men. Amongeſt the ſages he is moſt wiſeſt, that preſumeth to know leaſt: &amp; amongeſt the ſimple he is moſt ignoraunt, that thinketh to know moſt. For if ther be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d one that knoweth much: yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ther is found an other y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knoweth more. This is one difference wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wiſe men are knowen from thoſe that be ſimple, that is to wete, that the wiſe man to one that aſketh him a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwereth ſlouly &amp; grauely, and the ſimple ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though he be not aſked, aunſwereth quicke &amp; lightly. For in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> houſe wher nobleneſſe &amp; wiſdom ar, they giue riches without meaſure, but they giue words by ounces. I haue told the al this <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> bicauſe thy wordes haue wounded me in ſuch ſorte, thy teares in ſuch wiſe haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me, and thy vayne Iudgementes haue weryed me ſo much, that I can not ſay what I would, nor I thynke thou ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt perceiue what I ſay. Thoſe which wrote of mariage, wrote many things: but they wrote not ſo many troubles in al their bokes, as one woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſeth her huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to fele in on day.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:129"/>The auncientes ſpake well when they reaſoned of mariages: For at all tymes when they talked of mariage, at the beginnyng they put theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, <hi>Onus Matrimonij.</hi> That is to ſaye, thc yoke of mariage. For truly if the man be not well maried, all the troubles that maye happen vnto him in all the time of hys lyfe, are but ſmall in reſpect to be matched one daye with an euyll wyfe.</p>
                     <p>Doeſt thou thinke <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that it is a ſmall trouble for the huſbande to ſuffre the brawlinges of his wife? to indure her vayne wordes? to beare with her fonde wordes? to gyue her what ſhe requireth? to ſeeke that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth? and to diſſemble with all their vanities? trulye it is ſo vnpacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that I would not deſyre any greater reuengement of my enemye, then to ſee him maried with a brawlynge wyfe.</p>
                     <p>If the huſbande be proude, you doe humble him: For there is no proude man, what ſo euer he be, but a fyerce woman will make him ſtoupe.</p>
                     <p>If the huſbande be foolyſhe, you reſtore him his ſences againe: For there is no greater wyſedome in the world, then to know how to endure a braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge woman. If the huſbande be wylde, you make him tame: For the time is ſo much that you occupie in brawling, that he can haue no time to ſpeake. If the huſbande be ſlow, you make him runne: for he deſireth ſo much your contentation in harte, that the wofull man can not eate in quiete, nor ſleape in reſt. If the huſband be a great talker, in ſhorte ſpace you make him do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me: For the floutes and mockes that you gyue hym at euery worde, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in nombre, that he hath none other remedye but to refraine his tonge. If the huſband be ſuſpitious, you make him chaunge his minde: For the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felles that you aſke at euery houre are ſuch, and ſo many, and you therwith ſo ſelfe willed, that he dare not tell what he ſeeth in hys owne houſe.</p>
                     <p>If the huſband be a wanderer abroade, you make him forthwith to be abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at home: for you looke ſo yll to the houſe and goodes, that he findeth no other remedye but to be alwayes at home. If the huſband be vitious, you reſtraine him immediatly: for you burden his hart with ſo manye though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that his bodye hath no delighte to vſe any pleaſurs. Finally I ſay that if the huſbande be peacible, within ſhorte ſpace you make hym vnquiete: for your paines are ſuche, ſo many, and ſo continuall, that there is no harte can wholye diſſemble them, nor tong that vtterly can kepe them ſecret. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally women haue in al thinges the ſprite of contradiction, for ſo muche as if the huſbandes wil ſpeake, they wil hold their peace. If he go forth, they wil tarye at home. If he will laughe, they will weape. If he will take pleaſure, they will vexe him. If he be ſorowfull, they will be merye. If he deſire peace, they would haue warre. If he would eate, they will faſt. If he would faſte, they would eate. If he woulde ſlepe, they will watche: and yf thou wilte watche, they will ſleape. Fynally I ſay, that they are of ſo euill a condicion, that they loue all that we diſpiſe: and diſpiſe al that we loue. In mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the men that are wiſe, and will obteine that which they deſire of their wiues: let them not demaunde of them that whiche they would obtaine, yf they will come to their deſire. For to them which are diſeaſed, the letting of bloud is moſt profitable, when the vaine in the contrarye ſide is opened. It is no other thing to be let bloud in the contrary ſide, but to aſke of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21411:129"/>
with his mouthe, the contrary of that whiche he deſireth with his harte: for otherwyſe, neither by fayre wordes of his mouth, nor by the bitter teares of his eyes, he ſhall euer obtayne that whiche his harte deſireth. I confeſſe <hi>Fauſtine</hi> it is a pleaſaunte ſporte to beholde the younge Babes, and thou canſte not denaye me, but it is a cruell torment to endure the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of their mothers. Chyldren nowe and then miniſtre vnto vs occaſions of pleaſures: but you that are their mothers neuer doe any thinge, but that whiche turneth vs to trouble. It is muche pleaſure to the huſbande when he commeth home to fynde the houſe cleane ſwepte, to fynde the table coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to fynde the meate ready dreſſed: this is to be vnderſtanded, if all other thinges be well. But what ſhall we ſaie when he ſeeth the contrarie? and that he findeth his children weaping, his neighbours offended, his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes troubled, and aboue all, when he findeth his wyfe brauling. Truly it is better to the wofull huſbande, to goe his waye faſtinge: then to tary and eate at home with brauling. I durſt take vpon me to cauſe, that al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried men would be content to forbeare all the pleaſures of the children, with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition that they might be fre from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> annoiaunce of the mothers: for in the end, the pleaſures of the children endeth quickly with laughter, but the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mothers endureth al their life with ſorow. I haue ſene one thing in Rome, wherin I was neuer deceiued, which is, that though men commitie great offences in this worlde, yet God alwayes deferreth the puniſhmente thereof vntyll another: But if for any womans pleaſure we committe any faulte, God permitteth, that by the ſame women, in this worlde we ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the payne. There is no crueller enemy to man, nor more troubleſome to liue with all, then the woman is that he kepeth in his houſe: for if he ſuffer her once to haue her owne wyll, then let him be aſſured neuer after to bring her vnto obedience. The younge men of Rome folowe the Ladies of <hi>Capua,</hi> but they may well repente them: for there was neuer man that haunted of any longe tyme the company of women, but in the ende to their procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either by death, or with infamie he was defaced. For the Gods eſteme the honour aboue all thinges, and as they ſuffer the wickednes of the euyll men: ſo we ſee the ſharpe puniſhementes that they ordeine for them. I am well aſſured <hi>Fauſtine</hi> of one thing, and I doe not ſpeake it by heare ſaye, but becauſe continually I haue proued it, and it is: that the huſband which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcendeth to all that the wyfe deſireth, cauſeth his wife to doe nothing of that her huſband commaundeth. For there is nothing that kepeth a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more vnder obedience to her huſband: then when oft times he denieth with ſharpe wordes her vnlawfull requeſt. In my opinion it is muche crueltie of the barbarous, to kepe (as they do) their wiues like ſclaues: but it is muche more folly of the Romaines, to kepe them (as they doe) like Ladies. The fleſhe ought not to be ſo leane that it be in eating drie, nor yet ſo fat that there be no leane: but it would participate both of the fat and of the leane, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it might geue the more nouriſhement. I meane, that the man of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ought not to kepe his wyfe ſo ſhorte, that ſhe ſhould ſeme to be his ſeruaunt: nor yet to geue her ſo muche libertie, that ſhe becommeth his miſtreſſe. For the huſbande that ſuffereth his wife to commaunde more then ſhe ought, is the cauſe why he him ſelfe afterwardes is not eſtemed as he
<pb facs="tcp:21411:130"/>
ſhould be. Beholde <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> you women are in all thinges ſo extreame, that for a litle fauour you waxe proude: and for a litle diſpleaſure you become great enemies. There is no woman that willingly can ſuffer to haue any ſuperiour, nor yet ſcarcely can endure to haue any equal: for we ſee that you loue not the higheſt, nor deſire to be loued of the loweſt. For where as the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers be not equal, there their loue can not be perfite. I knowe well <hi>Fauſtine</hi> that thou doeſt not vnderſtande me, therefore harken what I doe tell thee, more then thou thinkeſt, and more then thou wouldeſt. O what and howe many women haue I ſene in Rome, the which though they had two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound of rent in their houſes, yet they had thre thouſand follies in their heades: and the worſte of all is, that oftetimes her huſbande dieth, and ſhe looſeth her rente, yet for all that ceaſſeth not her folly. Nowe liſten <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> and I will tell thee more. All women will ſpeake, and they will that others be ſilent. All wil commaunde, and will not that they be commaunded. All wil haue libertie, and they wil that al be captiues to them. Al wil gouerne, and wil not be gouerned. Finally they al in this one thing agree, and that is that they will cheriſhe theym that they loue, and reuenge theym of thoſe that they hate. Of that whiche before is ſaide it may be gathered, that they make fooles and ſclaues of the young &amp; vaine men which folow them: and perſecute the wiſe men, as enemies that flie them. For in the end where as they loue vs moſte, their loue may be meaſured: but where as they hate vs leaſte, their hate exceadeth reaſon. In the <hi>Annales</hi> of <hi>Pompeius</hi> I remember I haue redde, &amp; doe note one thinge worthy of knowledge, that when <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi> the great paſſed firſt into <hi>Aſia,</hi> as by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he came by the mountaines of <hi>Rypheos,</hi> he founde in thoſe places a Barbarous nation, that liued in the ſharpe mountaines as wilde beaſtes: and doe not marueile that I doe call them beaſtly, that liue in thoſe mountaines. For as the ſheepe &amp; cowes that feade on the fine graſſe, haue their wolle ſofte and fine: ſo the men which are brought vp in the ſharpe &amp; wylde mountaines, vſe themſelues after a rude behauiour. Theſe Barbarous had therfore a lawe among them, that euery neighbour had in thoſe mountaines two caues: for the ſharpnes of the hyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les permitted not that they ſhould haue any houſes. Therefore in one caue, the huſbandes, the ſonnes, and the ſeruauntes were: and in the other, his wife, his doughters, and his handemaydes abode: they did eate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers twiſe in the weeke, they ſlept togethers other twyſe in the weeke, and al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſidue of the time, they were ſeperate the one from the other. The great <hi>Pompeius</hi> aſked them what the cauſe was why they liued ſo, ſithe it was ſo that in all the world there was neuer ſene nor redde ſuch extreme lawe, nor ſo ſtraunge a cuſtome. The hiſtorie ſaith in that place, that an auncient man aunſwered him, ſaying beholde <hi>Pompeius,</hi> that the gods haue geuen ſhort life vnto vs that be preſent, in reſpect of that whiche he gaue to our fathers that are paſt: and ſince we lyue but fourty or fiftie yeres at the vttermoſt, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to enioye thoſe daies in peace: for the life is ſo ſhorte, and oure trouble ſo longe, that we haue ſmall tyme to reioyce in peace after we retourne from the warres. It is true, that amongeſt you Romaines, whiche enioye plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and richeſſe, life ſeameth to ſhort: but vnto vs that haue toyle with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, lyfe ſemeth to longe: For through out all the yeare we neuer keape
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21411:130"/>
ſuche ſolempne feaſtes, as when one paſſeth out of his life. Conſider <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi> that if men liued many yeares, there ſhould be time to laugh &amp; weepe, to be good and to be euill, to be poore and to be ryche, to be mery and ſadde, to lyue in peace and warre: but why wyll men ſeeke contention in their lyfe, ſynce it is ſo ſhorte? In keping with vs (as you doe) our owne wyues, in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing we ſhould die, for the nightes ſhould paſſe in hearing their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaintes, and the dayes in ſuffering their brawlinges: but keping them as we doe, we ſee not their heauy countenaunce, we heare not the cryeng of our chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we heare not their greuous complaintes, nor liſten vnto their ſorowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wordes, neyther we are troubled with their importunate ſutes, and yet the chyldren are nouryſhed in peace, and the father foloweth the warre: ſo that they are well, and we are better. This was the aunſwere that this olde man gaue, at the requeſte of the great <hi>Pompeius.</hi> Truly <hi>Fauſtine</hi> I ſaye, that though we call the <hi>Meſſagetes Barbarous,</hi> in this caſe they knowe more then the <hi>Latynes.</hi> For he that is free from a brawling woman, hath eſcaped no ſmall peſtilence. I aſk thee nowe <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> ſynce thoſe barbarous coulde not agree, nor would not haue their wyues with them in thoſe ſharpe mountaines, howe ſhall we other agree, and pleaſe you that lyue in theſe pleaſures in Rome? One thing I wil tel thee <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> and I beſech the Gods that thou mayeſt vnderſtande it, whiche is. If the beaſtly motions of the fleaſhe dyd not force men to wyll, and alſo to deſyre women, I doubte whether there ſhould be any woman in the worlde beloued or ſuffered. For though nature geueth them giftes worthy to be beloued: yet they through their ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion cauſe them ſelues to be hated. If the Gods had made this loue vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie, as they made it natural, ſo that we might haue loued as we would and lefte agayne at our pleaſure: that man ought worthely to haue ben pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed, whiche for the loue of any woman would putte his life in daunger. The gods haue kept this great ſecret vnto them ſelues, and the myſery that they gaue vnto men is very great: ſince that vnto ſo weake fleſhe, he gaue ſo ſtrong a harte, the whiche doth procure that whiche doth vs harme, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that whiche we ought to abhorre. This is an other ſecrete, that all men knowe when they offende, but I ſee no man that ſeketh amendement: for I heare all complaine of the fleſhe, and yet I ſee all like Bochers folowe the fleſhe: and when it can doe leaſt good, then it is moſte gredy. I enuye not the Gods liuing, nor the men that be dead, ſaue onely for twoo thinges, whiche be theſe. Firſt I enuy the Gods, becauſe they liue without feare of the malicious. Secondarely I enuie the dead, for that they liue without nede of women. For women are ſo corrupte, that they corrupte all: and they be ſuche mortall plagues, that both fleſhe and harte by them are brought to ende. O <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> the loue of the fleſhe is ſo naturall to the fleſhe, that when from you the body flieth in ſport, we then leaue our hartes engaged to you in earneſt. And though reaſon as reaſon putteth deſire to flight: yet the fleſh, as fleſhe, yeldeth it ſelfe as pryſoner.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:131"/>I Remember that in my youth, as I was of fleſhe, I trembled for feare of the fleſhe, with mynde neuer to retourne agayne, and I doe confeſſe that ofte tymes I reuolued in my harte, many holy and chaſte meditations: but yet notwithſtanding I gaue my body immediatly to ſondrie filthy vices. It is a naturall thing, that when man hath committeth any vice, forthwith he repenteth him of his dede: and ſo againe after his newe repentaunce, he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to his olde vyces. For during the time that we liue in the houſe of this frayle fleſhe, Senſualitie beareth ſo great a rule, that ſhe will not ſuffer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to enter in at the gate. There is no man in Rome, (if a man doeth aſke him) but wil marueile to declare with his tongue the thoughtes that he hath had in his hart, in eſpecially to be chaſte, to be true, to be pacient, &amp; to be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: and peraduenture ye talke with thoſe that ſomewhat communicate with them, &amp; let a man inquire of his neighbours, they ſhall finde that he is a deceiuer, a lier, and a blaſphemour. Finally, they deceiue men by their faire wordes, &amp; offended the gods by their euil workes. It profiteth litle to blaſe vertues with wordes, if the hand be negligent to worke them in dede: for a man is not called iuſt, only deſiring to be good in name, but for to labour to be vertuous in workes. The trayterous worlde in no one thinge beguileth worldlings ſo much, as by feading them with vaine hope, ſaiyng that they ſhall haue time enough to be vertuous: ſo that theſe blinde men, when they are once depely rooted in vices, &amp; whiles they hope for this light of amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then ſodainly aſſaulteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dreadful dart of death. Oh how many haue promiſed vnto men, &amp; vowed vnto the gods, &amp; determined with them ſelues, that before ſo many daies they would beginne to be vertuous: whom in ſhort ſpace after we haue ſene to engage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gry wormes of the earth. The gods wil that we be vertuous: &amp; for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary the world and the fleſhe willeth that we be vitious. Me thinketh that it is better to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the gods, then to doe that the world &amp; the fleſhe deſireth: for the praiſe of vertue is honour, &amp; the paine of vice is infamie. If thou doeſt conſider <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> thou ſhalt ſee that the gods are on the one parte, which procureth vs to vertues: and on the other part is the world, &amp; the fleſh, which inticeth vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vices. My opinion is we ſhould ſaye vnto the gods, that we deſire to be vertuous, &amp; that we ſhould ſay to the world &amp; the fleſh, that from henceforth we wil geue our ſelues no more to be vitious. We ought in ſuche caſe to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods with workes, &amp; to enterteine the world, &amp; the fleſh with words: that we imploy ſo much time in leading a good life, that we haue no time va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cant to ſpeake an idle worde. I let the wete <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that al that I haue told thee, I haue ſpoken it againſt my ſelfe: for always from my youth I had a good minde, &amp; yet for al that I haue ben ouerthrowen with vices. Oh how many times in my youth I knew wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with women, &amp; beleued women, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which in the ende haue deceiued me, miſuſed me, &amp; defamed me. At y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt I withdrew my ſelf &amp; forſoke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but I do confeſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if reaſon kept me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their houſes .x. daies, ſenſualitie kept me w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> .x. wekes. Oh cruel gods, oh wicked world, oh fraile fleſh, tel me what it meaneth, that reaſon leadeth me voluntarely to vertues, &amp; that ſenſualitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my wil draweth me vnto vices?

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21411:131"/>
But what ſhall I doe, wofull man, ſince at this daye there is not ſo cruell a ſcourge of my honoure, nor ſo great an enemy of my renowme, as myne owne fleſhe is,, the which againſt me doth make ſuch cruell warres. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beſeche the immortall gods, ſithe my beynge here is againſt my wyll, that they doe defende me in this ſo cruell warre. The frayle fleſhe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to blame, but muche more is the fooliſhe and lyght woman in faulte. For if men were certaine that women were chaſt, ſhamefaſte, and ſolitary, they would not diſpoſe their hartes, their bodies, nor bende their bowes to ſhoote at their buttes: they would not conſume their time to folowe them, looſe their goodes to ſerue them, neither would they ſuffer ſo many ſhames to ſclaunder them. For where the harte hath no hope to obteine, there he wil geue ouer his ſute. But what ſhal we doe now <hi>Fauſtine</hi> (I praie thee tel me) ſince thou knoweſt better then I, that the ſhame of the Romaine women is nowe gone, and the women of Italie are ſo diſſolute: that though men doe not regarde them, yet they doe entyſe them. If men flie, they call them: If men goe backe, they approche: If men are ſadde, they make them mery: If men are ſilente, they force them to ſpeake: and finally men begynne the loue in ſporte, and they temper it in ſuche ſorte, that they tourne it all into earneſt. I let thee wete <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that the meanes whereby nature worketh in man is very ſtraunge: but the ſhame whiche the Gods put in women is more marueilous. And if it be true, (as it is true in dede) that the men doe looſe the ſtynge of the fleſhe, and that the women doe not looſe the ſhame of the viſage: I thynke it is impoſſible that there ſhould be a chaſte or vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous woman in Rome. For there is no common wealth more vndone, then that where the women haue loſt their ſhame. O women, what reaſon haue they whiche flie form you, whiche are wery of you, whiche forſake you, whiche forget you, whiche make them ſelues ſtraungers, and furthermore whiche are dead and buried. For the hungrie wormes gnawe in the graue onely the frayle and ſlymie fleaſhe of the dead: but you women deſtroy the goodes, honoure, and lyfe of the liuing. Oh if the noble hartes knewe what euill doth folowe them, for dallieng with women: I ſweare vnto them, that they would not ſerue them continually as they doe ſerue them: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they would haue no luſte nor deſier to beholde them. What wilt thou I ſaye any more to thee <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> but that ſome ſcape out of your handes for ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate and ſclaundered, others hurte by your tongues, others perſecuted with your workes, other deceiued with your countenaunces, others deſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through your hatred, others deſperate through your inconſtancie, others condempned by your light iudgementes, others troubled through your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyndnes, finally thoſe that eſcape beſte, are of your hartes abhorred, and through your folly deſtroyed. Then ſince the man knoweth that he muſte paſſe all thoſe daungers, I can not tel what foole he is, that wyll either loue or ſerue you. For the brute beaſte that once hath felte the ſharpe teethe of the dogge, wil vnwillingly euer after come nere vnto the ſtake. Oh vnto what perils doth he offer him ſelfe, whiche continually doth haunte the company of women. For as much as if he loue them not, they deſpiſe him, and take him for a foole. If he doth loue them, they accompt him for light. If he forſake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they eſteme him for no body. If he followe them, he is accompted loſte.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:132"/>If he ſerue them, they doe not regarde him. If he doe not ſerue them, they deſpyſe hym If he wyll haue them, they wyll not. If he will not, they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him. If he doe aduaunce him ſelfe forth, they call hym importunate. If he flie, they ſaye he is a cowarde. If he ſpeake, they ſaye he is a bragger. If he holde his peace, they ſaye he is a diſſarde. If he laughe, they ſaye he is a foole. If he laughe not, thei ſay he is ſolempne. If he geueth them any thing, they ſay it is litle worth: &amp; he that geueth them nothing, he is a pinchpurſe. Finally he that haunteth them, is by them ſclaundered: and he that doth not frequent them, is eſteamed leſſe then a man. Theſe thinges ſo ſene, ſo harde, and ſo knowen, what ſhall the poore and miſerable man doe, ineſpecially if he be a man of vnderſtanding? For though he would abſent him ſelfe from women, the fleſh doth not geue him licence: &amp; though he would folow wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wiſedom wyl not condiſcende. Some men thinke in al their thoughts, that by ſeruices and pleaſures they may content women. But I let them knowe, if they know it not, that the woman is neuer contented though ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth what he can as maide, &amp; that he do al that he ought to do as a huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: though he taketh paines for her ſake aboue his force, &amp; though with the ſwet of his browes he releaueth her neade: though euery houre he putteth him ſelf in daunger, yee in the end ſhe wil geue him no thankes: but will ſay that he loueth an other, &amp; that he doth but that to pleaſe and ſatiſfie her. It is a long time ſince I deſired to tel thee this <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> but I haue deferred it vntil this preſent houre, hoping thou wouldeſt not geue occaſion to tel it thee. For a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mong wiſe men thoſe wordes ought chiefly to be eſteamed, which fittely to the purpoſe are declared. I remember that it is ſixe yeres ſince <hi>Anthonius Pius</hi> (thy father) choſe me to be his ſonne in law, and that thou choſeſt me for thy huſband, &amp; I thee for my wife: all the which thinges were done, my wofull aduentures permitting it, &amp; <hi>Adrian</hi> my lord commaunding it. The good <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonius Pius</hi> gaue his onely doughter in mariage vnto me, and gaue me like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe his noble Empire with great treaſures: he gaue me alſo the garde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Vulcanali</hi> to paſſe the time therin. But I thinke that on both ſides we were deceiued. He in choſing me for his ſonne in lawe, &amp; I in taking thee for my wife. O <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> thy father and my father in law was called <hi>Anthonius Pius,</hi> becauſe to al he was merciful, ſaue only to me to whom he was moſt cruel: for with a litle fleſh he gaue me many bones. And I confeſſe the truthe vnto thee, that nowe I haue no more teethe to byte, nor heate in my ſtomake to digeaſte: and the worſte of all is, that many tymes I haue thought to rage on my ſelfe. I wyll tell thee one worde, though it doth diſpleaſe thee, whiche is, that for thy bewtie thou art deſyred of many: and for thy euil conditions thou arte deſpyſed of all. For the fayre women are lyke vnto the golden pylles: the whiche in ſighte are very pleaſaunte, and in eatinge veray noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Thou knoweſt well <hi>Fauſtine</hi> and I alſo, that we ſawe on a daye <hi>Druſio,</hi> and <hi>Braxille</hi> his wife, which were our neighbours, and as they were brauling togethers, I ſpake vnto <hi>Druſio</hi> ſuche wordes: what meaneth this lorde <hi>Druſio?</hi> that being nowe the feaſte of <hi>Berecinthia,</hi> and being as we are adioyninge to her houſe, and preſente before ſo honourable aſſemblie, and furthermore thy wyfe beinge ſo faire as ſhe is, howe is it poſſible there ſhoulde bee any ſtryfe betweene you? Men which are maried to deformed
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21411:132"/>
perſonnes, to the end that they might kil them quicly, ſhould alwaies fal out with their wiues: but thoſe that are maried to fayer women, they oughte alwayes to liue togethers in ioy and pleaſure, to the end they may liue long. For when a fayre woman dyeth, though ſhe haue lyued a hundreth yeres, yer ſhe dyeth to ſone: and though a deformed woman lyueth a ſmal time, yet not withſtandyng ſhe dieth to late <hi>Druſio</hi> as a man being vexed, lifting vp his eyes into the heauens, fetchinge a greuous ſighe from the bottome of his hart ſayed theſe wordes. The mother <hi>Berecinthia</hi> pardon me, and her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe alſo, and al the companye beſides forgeue me, for by the immortall Gods I ſwere vnto the, that I had rather haue bene maried with a Moore of <hi>Calde</hi> that is ſo foule, then beinge maried as I am, with a Romaine be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing very faier: for ſhe is not ſoo faire and white as my life is wofull and blacke. Thou knoweſt well <hi>Fauſtine</hi> that when <hi>Druſio</hi> ſpake theſe wordes, I did wype the teares from his eyes, and I gaue him a worde in his eare that he ſhould procede no further in this matter: for ſuch women ought to be chaſtened in ſecrete, and afterwardes to be honoured openly O thou art infortunate <hi>Fauſtine:</hi> and the Gods haue euill deuided with the geuing the bewtye and riches to vndoe thy ſelfe: and denayeng thee the beſt, whiche is wiſedome and good condicions to kepe thy honour, Oh what euyl lucke commeth vnto a man, when God ſendeth him a fayer doughter, vnleſſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore the gods do permyt that ſhe be ſage, and honeſt: for the woman which is yong, folyſhe, and faier, diſtroyeth the common wealth, and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth al her parentage. I ſay vnto the againe <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that the Gods were very cruel againſt thee, ſince they ſwallowe the vp by the goulfes, wher all the euil periſheth: and toke from the all the ſayles and owers, whereby the good do eſcape. I remained xxxviii. yeres vnmaried, and theſe vi. yeres on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which I haue bene maried, me thinketh I haue paſſed vi. hundreth yeres of my life: for nothing can be called a tormente, but the euyl that man doth ſuffer that is euyl maried. I wil enſuer the of one thinge <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that if I had knowen before, which now I know, and that I had felte that whiche now I fele, though the gods had commaunded me and the emperour <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> my Lord deſired me, I had not chaunged my pouertie for thy riches, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my reſt for thy Empyre: but ſince it is fallen to thine and myne euyl for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I am contented to ſpeake lytel, and to ſuffer much. I haue ſo muche diſſembled with the <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that I can no more: but I confeſſe vnto the, that no huſband doth ſuffer his wife ſo much, but that he is bound to ſuffer her more, conſidering that he is a man &amp; that ſhe is a woman. For the man which willingly goeth into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> briers, muſt thinke before to endure y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prickes. The woman is to bold that doth contend with her huſband: but the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is more foole which openly quarrelleth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his wife. For if ſhe be good, he ought to fauour her to the end ſhe may be better: if ſhe be vnhappie, he oughte to ſuffer her to thend ſhe be not worſe. Trulye when the woman thinketh that her huſband taketh her for euil, it is a great occaſion to make her to be worſe: for women are ſo ambitious, that thoſe which comonly are euyl, wil make vs beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are better then others. Beleue me <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that if the feare of the gods, the infamy of the perſon, and the ſpeach of men do not refraine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman, al the chaſtiſements of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world wil not make her
<pb facs="tcp:21411:133"/>
refraine from vyce: for all things ſuffereth chaſtiſemente and correction, the woman only except, the which muſt be wonne by intreaty. The hart of the man is very noble, and that of the woman very delycate: bycauſe for a lytle good he wil geue a great reward, and for a great offence he wil geue no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Before the wiſe man marieth, let him beware what he doth: and when he ſhall determine to take the companye of a woman, he ought to be lyke vnto him that entereth into the warre, that determineth with himſelfe to ſuffer al that may happen, be it good or euil. I do not cal that life a warre without a cauſe, which the euyll maried man leadeth in his houſe: for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do more hurt with their tongues, then the enemyes do with their ſwor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des. It is a great ſimplycitie for a wiſe man to make accompt, or eſteme the ſimplycitie of his wife at euery time: for if they would marke, and take hede to that which their wife doth, or ſayth, I let them know that they ſhal neuer come to an ende. O <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> if the Romaine woman would alwayes one thing, that they would procure one thing, that they would be reſolued in one thing, though it were to our great charges we would haue pleaſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend vnto their deſires: but what ſhal we do, ſinſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which now pleaſeth you, a while after dipleaſeth you, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which you aſke for in the morning, ye wil not haue at none, that which you enioye at none days, do trouble you in the night, that which in the night you loue, ye care not for in the morninge, that which yeſterday ye greatly eſtemed, to day ye aſmuch deſpiſe. If ye deſired to ſee a thing the laſt yeare, this yere ye wil not heare talke of it, that which before made you to reioyce, doth nowe make you to be ſad, that which ye were wont and ought to lament, at the ſelfe ſame thinge a man ſeeth you laughe. Finally ye women are as children, which are appeaſed with an aple, and caſteth the golde to the earthe not wayeng it. I haue dyuers times thought with my ſelfe, if I could ſay or write any good rule, in keping the which, I might teach men to be quiet in their houſe. And by my counte I find (hauing experimented it alſo with the <hi>Fauſtine</hi>) that it is vnpoſſible to geue a rule to maried men: and if a man could geue them, they ſhould ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profite therwith, ſinſe their wiues lyue without rule. But notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that, I wil declare ſome rules how the maried folkes ſhold kepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their houſes: and how they ſhall (if they lyſt) auoide ſtrifes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates betwene them. For the huſbandes and the wiues hauyng warres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, it is impoſſible there ſhould be peace in the common wealth. And thoughe this preſent writynge hath not profited me, vnluckey and vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man: yet it may profite others which haue good wyues. For oft times the medycen whiche profiteth not for the tender eyes, ſuffiſeth to heale the hard heales. I know wel <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that for that I haue ſayd, and for that I wil ſay vnto the, thou and others ſuch like ſhall greatly enuye me. Ye will marke the words that I ſpeake, more then the intencion that I meane: but I proteſt before the Gods, that in this caſe my end is for none other intent, but to aduertiſe the good, wherof there are a great manye: and to punyſhe the euyl, whych are many moe. And though perchaunce neyther the one nor the other wil beleue, that my intencion in ſpeaking theſe thinges was good: yet therfore I wyl not ceaſe to know the good from the euyl, and to chooſe the euil from the good. For in my fantaſy the good wife is as the feaſaunt,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21411:133"/>
whoſe feathers we lytle eſteame, and regard much the bodye: but the euyll woman is as the Marterne, whoſe ſkynne we greatly eſteme, and vtterly deſpiſe the fleſhe. I wil therfore declare the rules wherby the huſbands may liue in peace with their owne proper wyues.</p>
                     <div type="part">
                        <head>The Rules are theſe.</head>
                        <p>THe firſte, the huſband muſt neades haue pacience and ſuffer his wyfe when ſhe is diſpleaſed: for in <hi>Libia</hi> ther is no ſerpent ſo ſpiteful as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyl woman when ſhe is vexed.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond, the huſband ought to prouide for his wife (accordyng to his abylitie) al that is neceſſary for her, as wel for her perſonne, as for her houſe: for oft times it chaunceth, that women ſeking things neceſſarie, find things ſuperfluous, and not very honeſt.</p>
                        <p>The third, the huſband ought to prouide that his wife do kepe good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: for women oft times are more troubled, with the wordes that their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil neighbours ſpeake againſt them, then for any occaſion that their huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des geue them.</p>
                        <p>The fourth, that the huſband ought to vſe a meane, that his wife be not to much a ſubiect, nor that ſhe ſtray to much abrod: for the woman that gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth muche in the ſtreates, bothe loaſeth her good name, and ſpendeth his goodes.</p>
                        <p>The fifth, the huſband ought to take hede that he ſtriueth not ſo with his wife, that ſhe be brought paſt ſhame: for the woman that towards her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande is ſhameleſſe, hathe no reſpect what diſhoneſtye ſhee committeth.</p>
                        <p>The ſixt, the huſband ought to let his wife vnderſtand that he doth truſt her: for the woman is of ſuch condicion, that that which a wiſe man would not ſhe ſhould do: ſhe wyl do ſoneſt, and that wherin ſhe ſhould take paynes, ſhe wil do nothing.</p>
                        <p>The ſeuenth, the huſband ought to be circumſpect that he do not holy truſt his wife with the goods and treaſours of the houſe, nor yet vtterly diſtruſt her: for if the wife haue the charge of the goods of the houſe, truly ſhe wyl augment lytel, and if the huſband do ſuſpect her, ſhe wil ſteale much.</p>
                        <p>The .8. the huſband ought to loke vpon his wife merily, &amp; at other times agayne ſadly: for women are of ſuch condicion, that when their huſbandes ſheweth them a merye countenaunce they loue them, and when they ſhew them ſelues demure, the feare them.</p>
                        <p>The 9. the huſband ought (if he be wiſe) in this to take good aduyſement, that his wife quarel not with his neighbours, for we haue oft times ſene in Rome, that for the quarrel of his wife againſt his neighbour, the huſband hath loſt his life, ſhe hath loſt her goodes, and a ſlaunder hath riſen through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the common wealth.</p>
                        <p>The 10. the huſband ought to be ſo pacient, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if he ſaw his wife comit any fault, in no wiſe he ſhold correct her openly, but in ſecret: for the huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that correcteth his wife before witnes, doth as he whiche ſpitteth into the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſpittel falleth againe into his eyes.</p>
                        <p>The 11. the huſband ought to haue much temperaunce, leſt he lay hands on his wife to puniſhe her: for truly the wife that with ſharpe words doth not amend, with al the chaſtyſementes of the world wyl neuer be good.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:21411:134"/>The 12. if the huſbande wil be in quyet wyth his wife, he ought to prayſe her before his neyghbours and ſtraungers: for amongeſt all other thinges women haue thys propertye, that of all they woulde be prayſed, and of none corrected.</p>
                        <p>The .13. the huſband ought to beware to prayſe any other then his owne wife, ſhe being preſent: for women are of this condicion, that the ſame day the huſbande commendeth any other woman, the ſame day his wife wyll caſt hym out of her harte, thinkinge that he loueth another and dyſpyſeth her.</p>
                        <p>The .14. the huſband oughte to make his wife beleue that ſhe is faier, though in dede ſhe be foule: for ther is betwene them no greater ſtrife, then to thinke that her huſband forſaketh her for being foule.</p>
                        <p>The 15. the huſband ought to put his wife in remembraunce of the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye, that they ſpeake of them that be euyl in the citye: for women are glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp; bycauſe they would be loth that men ſhould talke ſuch thing by them, as they talke of others, peraduenture they will refraine from thoſe vyces that others commit.</p>
                        <p>The 16. the huſband ought to take hede that his wife accept no new fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: for through acceptyng of new frendes, there grow commenly betwene them great diſcention.</p>
                        <p>The 17. the huſband ought to take heade that his wife beleue, that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not them whom ſhe hateth: for women are of ſuch a condicion, that if the huſbandes loueth al them that they hate, immediatlye they wil hate all thoſe which they loue.</p>
                        <p>The 18. the huſband ought ſometime in matters, which are not preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial vnto him, confeſſe him ſelfe to be ouercome: for women deſire rather to be counted the beſt in reaſoning (though it be of no value) then to haue other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a greater iewel geuen them.</p>
                        <p>In this ſort <hi>Fauſtine</hi> I wil ſay no more to the, but wiſhe that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſe what I ſe, and fele what I fele: and aboue al, that my diſſimulacion ſhould ſuffice to amend thy life.</p>

                     <p>NOw <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> ſince I haue the old venym from my hart expelled, I wil aunſwere to thy preſent demaund: for vnto demaundes &amp; aunſwers that paſſeth betwene the ſages, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tongue ought neuer to ſpeake word, but that firſt he aſke the hart lycence.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21411:134"/>
very obſtinate in your willes, and as vnpacient in your ſufferinges. I ſay not without a cauſe that women are extreame in their deſires: for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e are thinges wherof women are ſo deſirous, that it is wonder though neuer ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creature ſaw them, nor hard ſpeake of them. I haue not ſayd without a cauſe that women are ſuſpicious in their demaunds: for the Romaine wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men are of ſuch a condicion, that aſſone as a woman deſireth any thing, ſhe forthwith commaundeth the tongue to aſke it, the feete to ſeke it, the eyes to ſe it, the hands to fele it, and likewiſe the hart to loue it. I ſay not without a cauſe that women are obſtinate in their willes: for if a Romaine woman beareth any malyce to any man, ſhe wil not forbeare to accuſe him for anye ſlaunder, nor faile to purſue him for any pouerty, nor feare to kil him for any Iuſtice. I ſay not without a cauſe that women are vnpacient to ſuffer: for many are of ſuch condicion (I ſay not al) that if a man giue not ſpedely that whiche they deſire, they chaunge their coullour, their eyes looke read, their tongues runne quycke, their voyces are ſharpe, they frete with them ſelues, they trouble their neighbours abroade, and are ſo out of order that no man dare ſpeake vnto them within. You haue this good trade among ye wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that vnder coullour of being with child, you wil that we huſbands graunt ye al your deſires. When the ſacred ſenate, in the time of the valyaunt <hi>Camil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> made a law in the fauour of the Romaine Matrones with child, the wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men at that time longed not ſo much as they do at this preſent: but I can not tel what this preſently meaneth, that al ye are annoynted with that that is good, &amp; that ye are all deſirous of that that is euyl. I wil tel the <hi>(Fauſtine)</hi> the occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why this law was made in Rome, &amp; therby thou ſhalt ſe if thou deſerueſt to enioy the priuyledge therof or no: For the lawes are but as yo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes vnder the which the euyl doth labour, and they are winges wherwith the good doth flye. The caſe therof was ſuch, that <hi>Camillus</hi> the valyaunt cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine went forth to the warres, he made a ſolempne vow to the mother <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recinthia,</hi> that if the gods gaue him the vyctorie, he would offer vnto her an Image of ſiluer: and after <hi>Camillus</hi> wanne the victory, &amp; that he would haue accompliſhed his vow to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother <hi>Berecinthia:</hi> nother he had any riches, nor Rome had any ſiluer. For at that time, Rome was rich of vertues, and poore of money. And know thou <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that our auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fathers were deuout to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards the gods, &amp; curious in repairing the temples, the which they eſtemed to be great deuocions: &amp; they were in ſuch ſort obſerued of their vowes, that neither for ſlouth, nor pouerty, they would obmitte their promiſes towards their gods. And in theſe things they were ſo preciſe, that they graunted to no man any triumphe, onleſſe he did ſweare that he had vnto the gods made a vow, &amp; afterward alſo proued how he performed it.</p>
                     <p>At that time floriſhed in Rome manye vertuous Romaynes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye greeke phyloſophers, manye hardye Captaynes, and manye ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous buildinges: and aboue all thinges, Rome was vnpeopeled of malyces, and adorned with vertuous Ladies. The Hiſtoriographers made (and not withoute a cauſe) greate accompte of theſe vertuous matrones: For the commonne wealthe hathe as muche neade of vertuous women, as the warres haue of valyaunte Captaynes.

woman) determined all to go into the high Capitoll, &amp; ther to offer al their Ieuelles and treaſours that they had, their cheynes, their ringes, their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, their bracelettes, their girdels, their buttons, and hangers of golde, of ſiluer, and precious ſtones of all ſortes with al their tablettes. The Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of this time ſay, that after the Romaine women had layed ſo greate a multitude of riches, at the feete of the ſacret ſenate, in the name of them all one of them ſpake, whoſe name was called <hi>Lucina,</hi> &amp; ſaid in this ſort. Fathers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcript, eſteme not much theſe our Iewelles, which we geue you to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ymage of the mother <hi>Berecinthia:</hi> but eſteme much this, that we willynglye put in ieopardye our huſbandes, and children, to win you the vyctory. And if in this caſe you accept our poore ſeruyce, haue no reſpect to the lytel which we do offer: but to the great which (if we were able) we would giue. Truly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romains, though the treaſure which their wiues offered was great: Yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they did more eſteme the good wil wherwith they gaue it, then they did the giftes them ſelues. For ther was ſo much in dede, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed both to make the ymage of the goddeſſe <hi>Berecinthia,</hi> and alſo for a long time to maintaine the warres. Therfore from that day that thoſe matrones preſented their Iewelles in the highe Capitoll, the ſenate foorthwith in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce of the gentlenes, graunted them theſe fiue thinges as a priuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: For at that time Rome neuer receyued ſeruice, or benefyt of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but ſhe rewarded it with double payment.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing that the ſenate graunted the Romaine women was, that in the day of their burial, the Oratours might openly make oracions in the praiſe of their lyues: For in old time men vſed neyther to exalt theym when they were dead, nor yet to accompany them to their graues.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing that was graunted them was, that they might ſyt in the temples: for in the old time when the Romaynes did offer ſacrifices to their gods, the aged did alwayes ſyt, the prieſtes kneele, the maried men did leane, but the women, though they were of noble and high linage, could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſuffered to talke, ſit nor to leane.</p>
                     <p>The third thing that the ſenate graunted the women of Rome was, that euery one of them might haue .ii. rich gownes, and that they ſhould not aſke the Senate leue to weare them: for in the olde time if any women were apparelled, or did bye any newe gowne withoute aſkinge licence of the Senate, ſhee ſhoulde immedyatlye looſe her Gowne, and bycauſe her huſbande did condiſcende vnto the ſame, he was bannyſhed the common wealthe.</p>
                     <p>The fourth thing which they graunted them was, that they ſhold drinke wine when they were ſicke: for there was in Rome a cuſtome inuyolable, that thoughe their lyfe was in hazard, they durſt not drinke wine but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For when Rome was wel corrected, a woman that druncke wine was aſmuch ſlaundered among the people: as if ſhe had committed adulterye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes her huſband.</p>
                     <p>The fift thing graunted by the ſenate vnto the women was, that a man might not denay a Romaine being with chyld, any honeſt and lawful thing that ſhe demaunded. I cannot tell why the auncientes of Rome eſteamed more women with child, then others that had no children.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:21411:135"/>Al theſe fiue things were iuſtly graunted to the Matrones, and noble Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Ladyes. And I can tel the <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that they were of the Senate moſt willingly graunted. For it is reaſon that women which in vertues do excell, ſhould with all meanes be honoured. I wil tel the <hi>Fauſtine</hi> the eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cauſe that moued the Romaynes to graunte vnto you Matrones this laſt pryuyledge: that is to wete, that a man cannot denay them any thinge being with child. Thou oughteſt to know, that the others (aſwel Grekes as Latynes) did neuer giue lawes, nor inſtitutions vnto their people, without great occaſions: For the great multitude of lawes are comonly euill kept, and on the other part are cauſe of ſondrye troubles. We cannot denaye but that the auncientes did wel auoyde the great nomber of inſtitucions: For it is better for a man to lyue as reaſon commaundeth him, then as the lawe conſtrayneth him. The caſe therfore was, that in the yere of the foundacion of Rome .364. <hi>Fuluius Torquatus</hi> then being Conſul, in the warre againſte the <hi>Volces,</hi> the knightes of <hi>Mauritania</hi> broughte to Rome an huge monſter with one eye, called <hi>Monoculus:</hi> which he had found in the deſertes of <hi>Egipt.</hi> At that time the wife of <hi>Torquatus</hi> called <hi>Macrina,</hi> ſhold haue bene deliuered of child: for the Conſul did leaue her great. This <hi>Macrina</hi> amongeſt al was ſo honeſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſpent as much time in Rome to prayſe her for her vertues: as they did ſet forth her huſband for his victories. They rede in the <hi>Annalles</hi> of that time that the firſt time that this Conſul <hi>Torquatus</hi> went into <hi>Aſia,</hi> he was eleuen yeres out of his countrey, and it is found for a truth, that in al the time that <hi>Torquatus</hi> was abſente, his wife was neuer ſene loke out at the windowe, whiche was not a thinge ſmally eſtemed: for though it was a cuſtome in Rome to kepe the dore ſhut, it was lawfull notwithſtandinge to ſpeake to women at the windowes. Though men at that time were not ſo bold, &amp; the women were ſo honeſt: yet <hi>Macrina,</hi> wife to <hi>Torquatus,</hi> lyued ſo cloſe and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to her ſelfe, that in all theſe 11. yeres ther was neuer man that ſaw her go through Rome, nor that euer ſaw her dore open, neither that ſhe conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at any time (from the time that ſhe was viii. yeres of age) that any man ſhould enter into her houſe: &amp; more ouer, ther was neuer man ſaw her face wholy vncouered. This Romaine Lady did this, to leaue of her a memory: &amp; to giue example of her vertue. She had alſo iii. children, whereof the eldeſt was but v. yeres old: and ſo when they were viii. yeres of age, immediatlye ſhe ſent them out of her houſe towards their parentes, leſt vnder the coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to vyſite the children, others ſhould come to viſite her. O <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> howe many haue I hard that haue lamented this excellent Romaine: and what wil they thinke that ſhal folow her life, Who could preſently reſtraigne a Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maine woman from going to the window .11. yeres, ſince thinges nowe a daies are ſo diſſolute, that they do not only deſire to ſe them, but alſo runne in the ſtreates to bable of them? Who ſhould cauſe now a dayes a Romaine woman, that in the 11. yeres ſhe ſhould not open her dores, ſince it is ſo, that when the huſband commaunded her to ſhut one dore, ſhe wil make the hole houſe to ringe of her voyce? He that now would commaund his wife to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at home, and let her of her vagaries into the towne, ſhal perceiue that ther is no <hi>Baſilie</hi> nor <hi>Viper</hi> that carrieth ſuche poiſon in her tayle, as ſhe wil ſpitt with her tongue. Who could make a Romaine women to be 11. yeres con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb facs="tcp:21411:136"/>
without ſhewing her face to any man: ſince it is ſo that they ſpend the moſt part of their time in loking in a glaſſe, ſetting their ruffes, bruſhing their clothes, and painting their faces? who would cauſe a Romaine woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to kepe her ſelfe, xi yeres from being vyſited of her neighbours, and frends, ſince it is true that now women thinke them greateſt enemyes, whych vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite them moſt ſeldom? Retournyng therfore to the monſtre, as they led this monſtre before the doore of <hi>Torquatus</hi> houſe, ſhe being great wyth child, &amp; her huſbande in the warre: by chaunce a maide of his tolde her how that this monſtre paſſed by, wherfore ſo great a deſire toke her to ſee the monſtre that for to kepe that ſhe had begon, ſodeinly for this deſier ſhe dyed. Truly I tel the <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that this monſtre had paſſed many times by the ſtreat wher ſhe dwelt, &amp; ſhe would neuer notwithſtandyng go to the window: and muche leſſe go out of her doore to ſee it. The death of this Romaine of many was lamented: for it was a long time that Rome had neuer heard of ſo honeſt &amp; vertuous a Romaine wherfor at the peticion of al the Romayne people, and by the commaundement of al the ſacred ſenate, they ſet on he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>AL noble men, that are of hault courages, watch continually to bringe that to effect which they couet, and to kepe that which they haue: For by ſtrength one commeth to honour, and by wiſedom, honor, &amp; life, are both preſerued. By theſe wordes I meane, that ſhe that hath borne .9. mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes (through trauaile) the creature in her wombe with ſo much paine &amp; that afterwards is delyuered with ſo greate perill, &amp; by the grace of god from ſo many daungers eſcaped, me thinke it is not wel that in this point (which for the noriſhment of the babe is moſt expedient) the mothers ſhould ſhew them ſo negligent. For that wanteth no foly, that by extreame labour is procured, and with much lightnes afterward deſpiſed. The thinges that women na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaly deſire are infinite, among the whych, theſe are foure cheafely.</p>
                     <p>The firſt thing that women deſire, is to be very faire: For they had rather
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21411:136"/>
be poore and faire, then to be riche and foule.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing which they deſire, is to ſe them ſelues maried: for vntill ſuch time as the woman doth ſee her ſelfe maried, from the bottome of the hart ſhe alwayes ſigheth.</p>
                     <p>The third thing that women deſire, is to ſe them ſelues great with child, &amp; herein they haue reaſon. For vntil ſuch time as the woman hath had a child, it ſemeth that ſhe taketh him more for a louer then for a huſband.</p>
                     <p>The fourth thing that they deſire, is to ſe them ſelues deliuered, and in this caſe more then all the reſt they haue reaſon: For it is greate pitie to ſee in the pryme time a yong tre loden with bloſomes: and afterward the fruite to be deſtroyed throughe the abondaunce of caterpillers. Then ſince god ſuffereth that they are borne faire, that they ſe them ſelues maried, that they be with child, and that they are deliuered: why be they ſo vnkind, as to ſend them out of their houſes, to be nouriſhed in other rude cotages? In my opinion the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is vertuous, ought aſſone as ſhe is deliuered, to lift vp her eyes, and with her hart to giue god thankes for her frute: For the woman that from her deliuerie is eſcaped, ought to accompt her ſelfe as one newly borne. The woman likewiſe ſeing her ſelfe deliuered of her creature, ought to geue it ſucke with her owne breaſtes, for it is a monſterous thinge, that ſhe that hath brought forth the creature out of her owne proper wombe, ſhould geue it to be nouriſhed, of a ſtraunge dugge, In ſpeaking more plainly (it is al one to me whether ſhe be a noble woman, or a woman of meane condicion) I ſay &amp; affirme, that god hath deliuered her of al her trauaile, ſhe her ſelf ought with her owne pappes to nouriſh and geue ſucke to their babes: for nature did not only make women able to beare men, but alſo beſides that prouided milke in their breaſtes, to nouriſhe their children. We haue neither redde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til this preſent, nor ſene, that any beaſtes (wild or tame) after they had yong, would commit them to any other to be nouriſhed. This which I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is not ſo worthy of noting, as that which I will ſpeake. And it is, that many beaſtes new borne, before they open their eyes to know their fathers, haue now all ready taken nouriſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the teates of their mothers: &amp; more then that, to ſe ſome of thoſe litle beaſtes haue .x. litle whealpes, the which without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aide of any others nouriſhed them al with the ſubſtaunce of their owne teares, &amp; the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that hath but one child diſdaineth to giue it ſucke. Al that ſhal read this writing ſhal find it true, &amp; if they wil, they may ſe as I haue ſene it by experience: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after the ſhe Ape hath had her yonglings, ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hath them in her armes ſo long as they ſucke, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> oftentimes ther is ſuch ſtrife betwene the male, &amp; the female, which of them ſhal haue the yong<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lings in their armes, that the beholders are enforced to part them with bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Let vs leaue the beaſts that are in the fields, &amp; talke of the byrdes that are in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neaſts: the which do lay egges to haue yong, yet haue they no milke to bring them vp. What thing is ſo ſtraung to ſe, as a ſmal bird that hath vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her winges v. or vi. litle naked byrds, the which when ſhe hath hached, ſhe hath neither milke to nouriſh them, nor corne to giue them, they haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wings to fly, fethers to couer them, nor any other thing to defend them: yet in al this weaknes &amp; pouertie their mother forſaketh them not, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth them to any other but bringeth them vp al her ſelfe. That which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:21411:137"/>
prouided for the ſwannes is no leſſe marueilous, in eſpeciallye when they nouriſhe their yong ſignettes in the water: Foraſmuch as duringe the time that they can not ſwimme, the mothers alwayes in the day are w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thier yong ſignetts in their neaſtes, and in the night the fathers carie them vnder their proper winges (to refreſh theym) vnto the water: It is therfore to be thought, ſince theſe ſwannes ſo louyngly beare their yonglings vnder their wings, that they would cary them in their armes if they were men, and alſo giue them ſucke with their owne breaſts if they were women <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth in his fift booke <hi>De animalibus,</hi> that the lyons, the beares, the wolues, the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> griffins, &amp; generally al beaſts, neuer are, wer, nor ſhal be ſene ſo fierce nor ſo cruel, as when they haue yonglings, and this thing ſemeth to be true: for at that time, we ſe that many beaſts might eſcape the hunters, yet to ſaue their yonglings they turne backe &amp; put their proper lyues in daunger. <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth in his booke of lawes, that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are neuer ſo welbeloued of their mothers, as when they are nouriſhed wyth their proper breaſts, &amp; that their fathers daunceth them of their knees. The whych thing is true: for the fyrſt loue, in al things is the trueſt loue. I was willyng to ſhew the bringing vp of brute beaſts, to ſhew the women with chyld, how pitieful parents they are in nouriſhing their yonglings with their owne breaſts: &amp; how cruel mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers women are, in committing their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſtraungers. It is a meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thyng to here the mothers ſay that they loue their children, &amp; on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide to ſe how they hate them. In this caſe, I cannot tel whether they loue more, eyther the child, or the money: for I ſe that they couet greatlye to hourd vp riches into their cheaſtes, and likewiſe they deſyre aſmuch to caſt out theyr children out of theyr houſes. Ther are dyuerſe reaſons wherby the mothers oughte to be moued to noriſhe their children (which they bare in their wombes) wyth their owne propre breaſtes.</p>
                     <p>The firſt reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that the mother ought to haue reſpect how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yong babe was borne alone, how litle he was, how poore, dilicate, naked, tender, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vnderſtanding: and ſince that the mother brought it forth ſo weake, &amp; feable, it is neither mete nor conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that in time of ſuch neceſſitie ſhe ſhold forſake it, &amp; commit it into the hands of a ſtraung nourſe. Let women par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, whether they be ladyes, brought vp in pleaſures, or other of meaner eſtate, accuſtomed with trauelles, I force not: but I ſaye, that thoſe which forſake their children in ſuch extremeties, are not pitiful mothers but cruel e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. If it be crueltie not to cloth him that is naked, who is more naked then the child new borne? if it be cruelty not to comfort the ſad, who is more ſad, deſolate, and ſorowful, then the child which is borne weping? if it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlenes not to ſuccoure the poore nedy, who is more neady, or more poore then the innocent child newly borne, that knoweth not as yet neyther to go, nor to ſpeake? If it be crueltie to doo euil to the innocent that cannot ſpeake, who is more innocent then the infant, that can not complaine of that whiche is done vnto him? The mother that caſteth oute of her houſe the children borne of her owne bodye, howe can we beleue that ſhe will receiue in any other of ſtraungers? when the infante is nowe greate, when he is ſtronge, when he can ſpeake, when hee can goo, when hee canne profitte him ſelfe, and get his meate, the mother maketh much of hym, and leadeth
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21411:137"/>
him about with her, but is lytle thanke vnto her: For then the mother hath more neade of the child to be ſerued, then the child hath of the mother to be cheriſhed: If the children were borne of the nayles, of the fingers, of the fete, or of the hands, it were a ſmal mater though their mothers ſent them forth to noryſhe: but I cannot tell what hart can endure to ſuffer this, ſince the child is borne of their propre intrayles, that they do commit it (to be brought vp) into the handes of a ſtraunger. Is there paraduenture at this day in the world any Ladye, that hath ſo great confidence in any of her frendes, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or neighbours, that ſhe durſt truſt any of them with the key of her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, wherin her Iewelles, money, &amp; riches lyeth? truly I thinke none. O vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind mothers, my penne had almoſt called you cruel ſtepmothers, ſince you lay vp in your hart the curſed mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ke of the ground, and ſende out of your houſes that which ſprang of your bloud. And if women ſhold ſay vnto me y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are weake, feable, &amp; tender, &amp; that now they haue found a good nourſe, to this I aunſwere: that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nourſe hath ſmal loue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> child which ſhe nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, when ſhe ſeeth the vngentlenes of the mother y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bare it. For truly ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lone doth noriſhe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> child with loue, that heretofore hath borne it with paine.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond reaſon is, that it is a thing very iuſt that women ſhould nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe their children, to the end they may be lyke vnto their conditions: For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they are no children, but are enemyes: for the child that doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence his mother that bare him, can not enioye a proſperous life, Synce the intention of the parentes in bringing vp their children is for none other purpoſe, but to be ſerued of them when they are old: they ſhal vnderſtande, that for this purpoſe ther is nothing more neceſſary, then the milke of the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per mother: for wher the child ſucketh the milke of a ſtraunger, it is vnlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it ſhould haue the condicions of the mother. If a kidde ſucke a ſhepe, they ſhal perceiue it ſhal haue the wolle more faire, &amp; the nature more gentle, then if he had ſucked a Goate, which hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wolle more hard, &amp; of nature is more wild: wherin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouerbe is verefied, not from whence thou commeſt, but wherof thou feedeſt. It auayleth a man much to haue a good inclinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but it helpeth him much more from his infancye to be wel taught. For in the end we profite more, with the cuſtomes wherwith we lyue, then we do by nature from whence we came.</p>
                     <p>The third reaſon is, that women ought to nouriſh their owne children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhold be hole mothers, &amp; not vnperfect: for the woman is counted but halfe a mother that beareth it, &amp; likewiſe halfe a mother that nouriſheth it: but ſhe is the hole mother, that both beareth it, &amp; nouriſheth it. After the duetie conſidered vnto the father that hath created vs, &amp; vnto the ſonne that hath redeamed vs, me thinketh next we owe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt duty vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother, that hath borne vs in her body: and much more it is that we ſhould beare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, if ſhe had nouriſhed vs with her owne breaſtes. For when the good child ſhall behold his mother, he ought more to loue her bycauſe ſhe nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed hym wyth her mylke: thenne bycauſe ſhe hath borne hym in her body.</p>

wer <hi>Hannibal</hi> for the <hi>Carthagians</hi> &amp; <hi>Scipio</hi> for the Romaines: ſone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that warre followed the warre of <hi>Macedonie</hi> againſt kinge <hi>Philip,</hi> The which when it was ended, that of <hi>Siria</hi> began againſt <hi>Antiochus</hi> king of <hi>Siria.</hi> For in .630 yeres the Romanes had alwaies continuall warres in <hi>Aſia,</hi> in <hi>Affricke,</hi> or in <hi>Europe.</hi> The noble Romanes ſent the conſul <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> (bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the great <hi>Scipio</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Affrican</hi>) for captaine of that warre. And after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny battayles, fortune ſhewed her force in a Citie called <hi>Sepila,</hi> the which is in <hi>Aſia</hi> the great, where king <hi>Antiochus</hi> was ouercome, and all his realme diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited: for trees that haue their rootes plucked vppe, muſt nedes within ſhort time loſe their fruites. After that kinge <hi>Antiochus</hi> was ouercome &amp; his land ſpoiled, <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> came vnto Rome triumphinge, for the victorie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had of <hi>Aſia:</hi> ſo that as his brother (for the victorie that he had of <hi>Affrica</hi>) was called <hi>Affricane,</hi> ſo he was called <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Aſian,</hi> becauſe he vanquiſhed <hi>Aſia.</hi> The captaines of Rome loued honour ſo much, that they would no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reward, nor recompence of their trauaile, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhoulde geue them the renowme of the realme which they had ouercome. Truly they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for the noble hartes ought lytle to eſteme the increaſe of their riches, &amp; ought greatly to eſteme the perpetuite of their good name. As <hi>Sextus Chero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis</hi> ſaithe in his third booke <hi>De ambigua iuſticia,</hi> that <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> had a long time the gouerment of the people, foraſmuch as he was conſul, cenſour, and Dictatour of Rome: for he was not onely hardy and couragious, but alſo he was ſage and wiſe, which thinge ought greatly to be eſteamed in a man. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth not determine it, which of theſe two is moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: eyther ſtoutnes to fight in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres, or policye to rule in peace. <hi>Scipio</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being Dictatour (which was an office then as the Emperour is now) it chaunced that the x. captaines which had bene with him in the warres, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently fought to haue entred into the Monaſtery of the virgines veſtalles: wherfore the Dictatour commaunded their heades to be cut of. For the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines puniſhed more cruelly thoſe, that only required the virgins veſtalls: then thoſe that forced the maried matrones. <hi>Cornelius Scipio</hi> was beſought of many in Rome, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would moderate &amp; chaunge his ſo cruel ſentence. And he which moſt in this caſe did importune him, was his brother <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> whoſe praier was not accepted: how be it in the end they ſayde the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, wer pardoned, by the requeſt of a ſiſter of the ſaid Dictatour <hi>Scipio</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Affrican.</hi> And bycauſe he blamed his brother <hi>Scipio,</hi> that he had done more for the doughter of his nourſe: then for the ſonne of his proper mother, he aunſwered. I let the wete brother, that I take her more for my mother that brought me vp, and did not beare me: then ſhe which hath borne me, and in my infancye hath forſaken me. And ſince I haue had her for my true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is but reaſonne that I haue thys for my deare and welbeloued ſiſter. Theſe were the woordes which paſſed betwene theſe two brethren. I haue diligently red in holy, and prophane wrytinges, that many tiraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes haue cauſed their owne mothers to be killed whiche bare them: but I could neuer find that they haue done any diſcurteſye or diſobedience, to the nourſes whyche gaue them milke. For the cruell tirauntes doo thirſte af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the bloude of others: but they feare theym whoſe milke they ſucke,</p>

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:21411:138"/>
is, to kepe them in more obedience: for if the fathers liue long time, they muſt of force come into the handes of their children. And let not olde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers make their accompts, ſaying that during the time that they ſhall haue the gouernement of the houſe, their children ſhalbe kepte in obedience: for in ſo doing they might abuſe them ſelues. For yong men in their youth, fele not the trauayles of this life: nor knowe not as yet, what it meaneth to make prouiſion for houſeholde. For to the ſtomacke that is ful, and cloyed with ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, al meates ſeameth both vnſauery and noyſome. It maye wel be, that ſince the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not nouriſhed in the houſe, that they know not their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes, that they loue not their parentes, that they come not nere their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, nor talke with their ſiſters, that they are ignoraunt of their fathers, &amp; do diſobey their mothers: wherfore ſince litle feare doeth abounde, and good wyl fayle, one daye they commit ſome miſcheauous offence, whereby they doe looſe their life worthely, and the fathers looſe the riches, and likewyſe their honour deſeruedly, to the intent that the fathers alwayes keape their proper chyldren vnder obedience, there is no better meane then to bring them vp in their owne houſes, the mother to geue them ſucke, and the father to teache them: for when the mother deſireth any thing of her chylde, ſhe ſhould not ſhewe him the belly from whence he came, but the dugges which he did ſucke. For all that whiche is aſked vs by the milke that we did ſucke, truly there is no harte ſo hard that can denay her. The hiſtoriographers ſay that <hi>Antipater</hi> among all the Gretians, was the moſt renowmed tyraunt: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romaines <hi>Nero.</hi> And theſe two wicked princes wer not great ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauntes becauſe they had committed many tyrannies: but becauſe they did committe one, which was moſt greuous of all others. For they doe not call a man a glutton, or cormoraunt, becauſe he eateth euery houre, but becauſe he deuoureth more at one paſte, then others doe in one daye. The caſe was, that <hi>Antipater</hi> in Grece, and <hi>Nero</hi> in Rome, determined to kyll their own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And the hiſtoriographers ſaye, that when <hi>Nero</hi> commaunded his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be killed, ſhe ſent to aſke of him why he would put her to death: wher vnto he anſwered, that he was cloyed to beholde the armes wherin he was nouriſhed, and therfore he cauſed her to be killed, to ſee the intrailes out of the which he came. This caſe was ſo horrible, that it ſemed to many not to ſpeake it: but concluding I ſay, as vniuſtly as the mothers loſte the mortall life: ſo iuſtly did the children get for them immortal imfamy. Nothing can be more wicked &amp; deteſtable to the children, then to kil their mothers which did beare them with paine, &amp; did nouriſh them with loue: but notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al this, we do not rede that euer they did kill, diſhonoure, nor yet diſobey their nourſes, which gaue them milke. <hi>Iunius Ruſticus,</hi> in the fifte booke of the bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaith, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two <hi>Gracchi</hi> (renowmed &amp; famous Romains) had a third brother being a baſtarde, who ſhewed him ſelf as valiaunt &amp; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the warres of <hi>Aſia:</hi> as the other twoo did in the warres of <hi>Africa.</hi> The which as he came one day to rome to viſite his houſe, he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therin his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which bare him, &amp; the nourſe which gaue him ſuck. To y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which nourſe he gaue a girdle of gold, &amp; to his own mother he gaue a iewel of ſiluer. Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which things y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother being aſhamed, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidring what her ſon had done, ſhe aſked him why he had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> norſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gold, which did but only geue him ſuck
<pb facs="tcp:21411:139"/>
and that he had not geuen the gyrdle of golde to her, as well as the Iewell of ſiluer, ſince ſhe had borne him, and brought him into the world. Wherun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he aunſwered in this maner, maruell not thereat mother why I doe this thing, for thou diddeſt beare me but nyne monethes in thy wombe, and ſhe hath geuen me ſucke and nouriſhed me theſe three yeres with her own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre pappes: and when thou diddeſt caſt me from thee out of thy ſight, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued me and nouriſhed me in her propre armes.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, women ought to enforce them ſelues to nouriſhe their children, to the ende they may kepe them the better, and that in their cradels they be not chaunged for others. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaieth, that the Cocowe commeth to the neaſte of another birde when ſhe hath laide her egges, &amp; ſucketh them, and layeth in the ſame place her own egges: ſo that the other birde thinking that they are her owne, hatchieth and nouriſheth them vp as her owne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuche tyme as they are able to flie. Then the Cocow killeth, and eateth the ſily birde that hath nouriſhed her, through the which occaſion the males of thoſe birdes, are at ſo great contention (that they haue bene ſo deceiued) that the one of them killeth the other the whiche they might let, if euery bird did nouriſhe her owne. In the ſame tyme that <hi>Philip</hi> reigned in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> (whiche was the father of the great <hi>Alexander) Arthebanus</hi> was kynge of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> who in his age had a childe borne, the whiche was ſtollen out of the cradell, and an other put in his ſteade. The nourſe whiche did nouriſhe it, through couetouſnes of money conſented to that treaſon: for the harte that is with couetouſnes ouercome, wyll not feare to committe any treaſon. It chaunced not long after that kyng <hi>Arthebanus</hi> died, and lefte (as he thought) his own ſonne for his heire: but within fewe dayes after the nourſe her ſelf, whiche had conſented vnto the robbery, diſcouered the thefte, and ſayd that ſhe could tell where the lawfull childe of the good kyng <hi>Arthebanus</hi> was, and that that childe whiche nowe was heire, was but the ſonne of a meane knight: but in dede it had bene better for thoſe of the miſerable realme, that the woman had neuer diſcouered the ſecrete. For it chaunceth oftetimes that a man maketh ſuche haſte of his horſe, that he hurteth his legge, &amp; through that occaſion afterwardes falleth and breaketh his necke. But what ſhal we ſaye to the <hi>Plebeical</hi> women, of baſe and meane eſtate (I doe not meane the noble, gentle, and vertuous ladies) whereof they are many, that though in great ſecrete their chiefeſt friende telleth them any thinge, yet before they drinke they will vtter it to another. Thus when the treaſon was diſcouered, cruel warres betwene theſe two princes began: ſo that in the end, in a great battayle they were both ſlayne, the one in defending, and the other in aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. At that tyme <hi>Olimpias</hi> reigned, who was the faire and worthy wyfe of <hi>Philip,</hi> and mother of <hi>Alexander.</hi> She had a brother named <hi>Alexander,</hi> who was both politique, and hardie, and hearing the <hi>Epirotes</hi> were in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and that twoo kinges were ſlaine in the fielde, he placed him ſelfe in the Realme, more of will, then of right. And let no man marueile, that this kyng occupied the Realme: for in the olde time, all the tyrannous princes thought that all that whiche they could obtaine without reſiſtaunce: did vnto them belonge by iuſtice. This king <hi>Alexander</hi> was he, whiche came into Italy in the fauoure of the <hi>Tarentines,</hi> when they rebelled againſt the Romaines: who
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21411:139"/>
afterwarde was ſlaine in battaile at <hi>Capua,</hi> where his body was vnburied. And truly it was a iuſte ſentence, that the tyraunt which bereueth many of their liues, ſhould him ſelfe taſte ſome ſhamefull death. I haue declared this hiſtory to this ende, that princeſſes and great ladies ſhould ſee, that if the wyfe of kyng <hi>Arthebanus</hi> had nouriſhed his ſonne, they coulde not haue rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it in the cradell, nor theſe twoo princes had not bene ſlayne in battayle, nor the common wealth had not bene deſtroied, nor <hi>Alexander</hi> had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the lande of another, nor had not come to conquere the contrey of Italy, nor the dead corps had not wanted his graue: for oftetimes it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, for not quenching a litle coale of fier, a whole foreſt &amp; houſe is burned. The deuine <hi>Plato</hi> among the Grekes, and <hi>Licurgus</hi> among the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> commaunded and ordeined in all their lawes, that al the <hi>Plebeical</hi> women, &amp; thoſe of meane eſtate, ſhould nouriſhe al their children, and that thoſe which were princeſſes and great ladies, ſhould at the leaſt nouriſhe their eldeſt and firſt begotten. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the booke of the reigne of princes ſaieth, that the ſixt kyng of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> was <hi>Thomiſtes,</hi> the whiche when he died lefte two children, of which the ſecond inherited the realme, becauſe the Quene her ſelfe had brought it vp: and the firſt did not inherite, becauſe a ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge nource had geuen it ſucke, and brought it vp. And hereof remained a cuſtome in the moſte parte of the realmes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that the childe whiche was not nouryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the pappes of his mother, ſhoulde inherite none of his mothers goodes. There was neuer, nor neuer ſhalbe a mother that had ſuche a ſonne as the mother of God, which had Ieſus Chriſte: nor there was neuer, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer ſhalbe a ſonne, which had ſuche a mother in the worlde. But the infante would neuer ſucke other milke, becauſe he would not be bounde to call any other mother, nor the mother did geue him to nouriſh to any other mother, becauſe that no other woman ſhould call him ſonne. I doe not marueile at al, that princeſſes and great ladies doe geue their children forth to nouriſhe: but that which moſte I marueile at is, that ſhe whiche hath conceiued and brought forth a child, is a ſhamed to geue it ſucke and to nouriſhe it. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the ladies doe thinke, that they deſerue to conceiue them in their wombes, and that they ſinne in nouriſhing them in their armes. I can not tell how to wryte, and much leſſe howe to vtter that which I would ſay: which is, that women are now a daies come into ſuch folly: that they thinke and eſteme it a ſtate, to haue in their armes ſome litle dogges: &amp; they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to nouriſh &amp; geue the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſucke with their own breaſtes. O cruel mothers, I cannot thinke that your hartes can be ſo ſtony, to endure to ſee and keape fantaſticall birdes in the cages, vnhappy Monkeis in the wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, fiſting ſpaniels betwene your armes, and ſo neglect and deſpiſe the ſwete babes, caſting them out of your houſes where they were borne, and to put them into a ſtraunge place where they are vnknowen? It is a thing which cannot be in nature, neither that honeſtie can endure, conſcience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, nor yet conſonant either to deuine or humaine lawes, that thoſe which God hath made mothers of children, ſhoulde make them ſelues nourſes of dogs. <hi>Iunius Ruſticus</hi> in the third booke of the ſayings of the auncientes ſaith, that <hi>Marcus Porcio</hi> whoſe life and doctrine, was a lanterne and example to al the Romain people, as a man much offended, ſaied on a day to the ſenate.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:140"/>
O fathers conſcripte, O curſed Rome, I can not tell what nowe I ſhoulde ſaye, ſithe I haue ſene in Rome ſuche monſterous thinges (that is to wete) to ſee women cary Parrottes on their fiſtes, and to ſee women to nouriſhe dogges, geuing them mylke from their owne breaſtes. They replied in the ſenate and ſayde. Tell vs <hi>Marcus Porcio</hi> what wouldeſt thou we ſhould doe whiche lyue nowe, to reſemble our fathers whiche are dead? <hi>Marcus Portio</hi> aunſwered them. The woman that preſumeth to be a Romaine Matrone, ought to be founde weauing in her houſe, and out of that to be found in the temple praying to God: and the noble and ſtoute Romane, ought to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in his houſe reding bookes, and out of his houſe, fighting in the playn fielde for the honour of his countrie. And ſuer theſe were wordes worthy of ſuche a man: <hi>Annius Minutius</hi> was a noble Romaine, and captaine of great <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi> who was a great friende to <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> after the battaile of <hi>Farſaliae:</hi> for he was an auncient, and on that could geue good councell, wherefore he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſcaped, but that he was choſen in Rome for Senatour, Conſul, or Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor euery yeare, for <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> was ſo mercifull to them that he pardoned, that thoſe whiche had bene his moſte enemies in the warres, were of hym in peace beſt beloued. This <hi>Annius Minutius</hi> then beinge choſen Cenſor within Rome (which was an office hauing charge of iuſtice) by chaunce as he went to viſite the wyfe of an other frende of his, the whiche laye in child bedde, (becauſe ſhe had great aboundaunce of mylke) he founde that a litle pretie bitche did ſucke her, vpon the whiche occaſion they ſaye he ſaid theſe wordes to the Senate: fathers conſcripte, a preſent miſchiefe is nowe at hande ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the token I haue ſene this daye (that is to wete) I haue ſeene a Romaine woman denie her owne chyldren her mylke, and gaue to ſucke to a filthy bitche. And truly <hi>Annius</hi> had reaſon to eſteme this caſe as a wonder: for the true and ſwete loues are not but betwene the fathers and children, and where the mother embraceth the brute beaſte, and forſaketh her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall childe whiche ſhe hath brought foorth, it cannot be otherwyſe, but there either wyſedome wanteth, or folly aboundeth: for the foole loueth that he ought to deſpiſe, and deſpiſeth that whiche he ought to loue. Yet thoughe the mothers wyll not geue their children ſucke, they oughte to doe it for the daunger whiche may come to the helthe of their perſonnes: for as the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which bryng forth children, do lyue more healthful then thoſe which beare none: ſo theſe which do nouriſh them, haue more health, then thoſe which doe not nouriſhe them. For although the brynging vp of children be troubleſome to women, it is profitable for their healthe. I am aſhamed to tell it, but it is more ſhame for ladies to do it, to ſee what plaſters they put to their breaſtes to drie vp their milke: and hereof commeth the iuſt iudgement of God, that in that place ofte tymes where they ſeke to ſtoppe their mylke, in the ſelfe ſame place, they them ſelues procure their ſodaine death. I aſke now, if wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe not enioye their children being younge, what pleaſure hope they to haue of them when they are olde. What a great comforte is it for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes to ſee the younge babe, when he wyll laughe, howe he twincleth his litle eies: when he wyll weape, how he wyll hange the prety lippe: when he woulde ſpeake, howe he wyll make ſignes with his lytle fyngers: when he wyll goe, howe he caſteth forwarde his feete: and aboue all, when he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21411:140"/>
to bable, howe he doubled in his woordes. What thing is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt to the father then to ſee them, and to the mother to agree to it, when the chyldren doe ſucke, they plucke forth the breſtes with the one hande, and with the other they plucke their heere, and further they beate their feete toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with their wanton eies, they caſte on their parentes a thouſande louyng lookes? what is it to ſee them when they are vexed and angry, how they wyll not be taken of the fathers, howe they ſtryke their mother: they caſte awaye things of golde, and immediatly they are appeaſed with a litle apple or ruſſhe? what a thing is it to ſee the innocentes howe they aunſwer when a man aſketh them, what follies they ſpeake, when they ſpeake to them, how they play with the dogges and runne after the cattes, how they dreſſe them in wallowing in the duſt, how they make houſes of earth in the ſtreates, how they weape after the birdes when they ſee them flie away? Al the which thinges are not to the eies of the fathers and mothers, but as Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingales to ſing, and as bread and meate to eate. The mothers peraduenture will ſaye that they will not bringe vp their children, becauſe when they are younge they are troubleſome, but that after they ſhoulde be nouriſhed and brought vp, they would be glad. To this I anſwere them, that the mothers ſhal not denay me, but that ſome of theſe things muſt neades meate in their children: that when they be old, they ſhalbe either proud, enuious, couetous, or negligent: that they ſhalbe lecherous, or els theues, that they ſhalbe bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemours, or els glottons, that they ſhalbe rebelles, or fooles, and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vnto their fathers. I beleue that at this daie there are many mothers in the worlde, which did hope to be honoured, &amp; ſerued with the children which they had brought vp: and afterwarde perceiuing their maners, would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglye forgo the pleaſures whiche they hoped for, ſo that they might alſo be deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the troubles, which through their euill demeanours are like to enſue. For that time which the parentes hoped to paſſe with their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in pleaſures, they conſume (ſeing their vnthrifty life) in ſorowfull ſighes. I councel, admoniſhe, &amp; humbly require princeſſes, &amp; great ladies, to nouriſhe &amp; enioy their children when they are young and tender: for after that they are great, a man ſhal bring them newes euery day of diuerſe ſortes, and maners they vſe, for as much as the one ſhal ſay that her ſonne is in pryſon, &amp; another ſhal ſay that he is ſore wounded, another that he is hid, others that he hathe plaied his cloke, others that he is ſclaundered with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon harlot, another that he ſtealeth his goodes from him, another that his enemies do ſeke him, another that he accompanieth with vnthriftes, and finally they are ſo ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, vnhappy, and ſo farre from that which is good: that oftentimes the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would reioyce to ſee them die, rather then to ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liue ſo euill a life. Me thinketh that the knot of loue betwene the mother and the childe is ſo great, that not onely ſhe ought not to ſuffer them to be nouriſhed out of the houſe one whole yere: but alſo ſhe ought not to ſuffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be out of her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence one only day. For in ſeing him, ſhe ſeeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is borne of her intrails ſhe ſeeth that which ſhe hath with ſo great paines deliuered, ſhe ſeeth hym who ought to inherite all her goodes, ſhe ſeeth him in who the memory of their aunceſtours remaineth: and ſhe ſeeth him, who after her death ought to haue the charge of her affayres and buſines. Concludynge therefore that whiche aboue is ſpoken, I ſaye that whiche the greate <hi>Plutarche</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:141"/>
ſaied, from whom I haue drawen the moſte parte of this chapter: that the mother (to be a good mother) ought to haue &amp; kepe her chylde in her armes to nouriſhe him, and afterwardes when he ſhalbe great, ſhe ought to haue him in her harte to helpe him. For we ſee oftentymes great euils enſewe, to the mother, and to the chylde, becauſe ſhe did not bringe hym vp her ſelfe: and to put hym to nouryſhe to a ſtraunge breaſte, there commeth neither honour, nor profite.</p>

The intention of thoſe excellent princes was, not to geue lawes to their predeceſſours, for they were now dead: neither they gaue them onely for thoſe which lyued in their tyme being wicked, but alſo for thoſe which were to come, whom they did preſuppoſe would not be good. For the more the worlde increaſeth in yeares, ſo muche the more it is loden with vices. By this that I haue ſpoken I meane, that if the princeſſes and great ladies, euery one of them woulde nouriſhe their owne childe, I neade not to geue them counſell. But ſince I ſuppoſe that the women which ſhalbe deliuered hereafter, wilbe as proude, and vaine glorious, as thoſe whiche were in times paſt: we will not let to declare here ſome lawes and aduiſes how the ladie ought to behaue her ſelf with her nource, and howe the nource ought to contente her ſelfe with the creature. For it is but iuſte, that if the mother be cruell, and hardy to forſake the creature: that ſhe be ſage, pitiefull, and aduiſed, to chooſe her nource. If a man finde great treaſoure, and afterward care not how to kepe it, but doth commit it into the handes of ſuſpected perſons: truely we would call hym a foole. For that which naturally is beloued, is alwayes of al beſt kept. The woman oughte more wyſely kepe the treaſure of her owne body, then the treaſure of all the earth if ſhe had it. And the mother which doth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that committeth her child to the cuſtody of a ſtraunge nource, not to her whom ſhe thinketh beſt, but whom ſhe findeth beſt cheape: we will not call her a fooliſhe beaſte, (for the name is to vnſeamely) but we will call her a ſotte, which is ſomewhat more honeſter. One of the things that doth make vs moſte beleue that the ende of the world is at hande: is to ſee the litle loue which the mother doth beare to the child being young, and to ſee the wante of loue which the childe hath to his mother beinge aged. That whiche the childe doth to the father and the mother, is the iuſt iudgement of God, that euen as the father would not nouriſhe the childe in his houſe, being younge: ſo likewiſe that the ſonne ſhould not ſuffer the father in his houſe, he beinge olde. Retourning therefore to the matter, that ſith the woman dothe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to drie and ſhut vp the fountaines of milke, whiche nature hath geuen her, ſhe ought to be very diligent to ſerch out a good nource: the which ought not only to content her ſelf to haue her milke whole, but alſo that ſhe be good
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21411:141"/>
of lyfe. For otherwiſe, the child ſhall not haue ſo muche profit by the milke which he ſucketh: as the nource ſhall do it harme, if ſhe be a woman of an euil life. I do aduiſe princeſſes and great dames, that they watche diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to know what their nources are, before they commytte their children to them: for if ſuch nources be euil, and ſlaundered, they are as ſerpentes which do byte the mother with their mouth, and do ſtinge the child with her taile. In my opinion it were leſſe euill, the mother ſhould ſuffer that her childe ſhould periſh in deliuering it: then for to kepe in her houſe an euill woman. For the ſorow of the death of the child, is forgotten and brought to nought in time: but the ſlaunder of her houſe, ſhall endure as long as ſhe liueth. <hi>Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Cheronenſis</hi> ſayeth, that the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> commaunded his ſonne to be broughte vp of a woman, the which was more faire then ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. And when the good Emperour was aduertiſed therof, he dyd not only ſend her from his pallace, but alſo he baniſhed and exyled her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome: ſwering that if ſhe had not nouryſhed his ſone with her pappes, he woulde haue commaunded her to haue bene torne in pieces with beaſtes. For the woman of an euil renowme, may iuſtly be condempned and put to death. Princeſſes and great ladies ought not greatlye to paſſe, whether the nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be faire or foule: for if the milk be ſwete, whyt, and tender, it littel ſkilleth though the face of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nource be whit, or blacke. <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſaieth, in the booke of the nourture of children, that euen as the blacke earth is more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till then is the white earthe: ſo likewiſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> woman which is browne in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, hath alwaies the moſt ſubſtaunciall milke. <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> in hys greateſt hiſtory ſayeth, that the Emperour <hi>Adocerus</hi> did mary him ſelfe with the daughter of an other emperour his predeceſſour called <hi>Zeno,</hi> &amp; the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe was called <hi>Arielna.</hi> The whych in bringing forth a Sonne, had a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Hungarye</hi> marueylous fayre to nouriſhe it, &amp; the caſe ſucceded in ſuch ſorte that the nource for being faire, had by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> emperour .iii. children the one after the other: &amp; his wofull wife neuer had any but the firſt alone. A man ought to beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the empreſſe <hi>Arielna</hi> did not only repent her ſelfe, for taking into her houſe ſo faire a nource: but alſo was ſory that euer ſhe had any at all, ſyth the rybald therby was myſtreſſe in the houſe, &amp; ſhe remained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out huſband all her life. I do not ſay it, for that ther are not many foule wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vitious, nor yet becauſe ther are not many faire women vertuous: but that princeſſes and great ladies (accordyng to the qualities of their huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des) ought to be profitable and tender nources, to bring vp their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For in this caſe there are ſome men of ſo weake co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plection, that in ſeyng a litell cleane water, immediatly they dye to drinke therof. Let therfore this be the firſt cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell in chouſing nources, that the nource before ſhe enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe be examined, if ſhe be honeſt, &amp; vertuous. For it is a tryfell whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nource be faire or foule: but that ſhe be of a good life, and of an honeſt behauiour.</p>
                     <p>Secondarily, it is neceſſary that the nource which nouriſheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> child, be not only good in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> behauiour of her life: but alſo it is neceſſary y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe be hole, as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodily health. For it is a rule vnfallible, that of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> milke which we do ſuck in our infancy, dependeth all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corporall health of our life A child geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the nource to nouriſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is as a tree remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one place to an other. And if it be ſo (as in dead it is) it behoueth in al pointes, that if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth wher

in it ſhalbe new put were no better, that at the leſt it be not worſe: for thys ſhould be a great crueltie, that the mother beyng hole, ſtrong, and well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſhould geue her child to a leane woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to nource, which is feable, ſore, and diſeaſed. Princeſſes and great la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in that they do fayle, it is not for that they would erre: but it is bycauſe that ſuch feable and weake nources (by a vaine deſire they haue to be nources in a gentilma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s houſe) on the one part they ſay they will litel money, &amp; on the other parte they do make great ſutes. What a thing is it when a princeſſe or a noble woman is deliuered of a child, to ſe the deuyſes of other women among them ſelues, who ſhalbe the nource, and how thoſe the whyche neuer nouriſhed their owne children, do preſerue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> milke to nouryſhe the children of others. To procure this thing for women<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> me thinketh it proceadeth of aboundaunce of folly: and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to their requeſtes, me thinketh it is for wante of wiſedome. They looke not alwayes to the manners and habilitie of the nource, how apte ſhe is to nource their childe, but how diligent ſhe is in procurynge to haue it to nouriſhe. They care not greately whether they be good or no: for if the firſte be not good, they will take the ſecond, and if the ſecond pleaſeth them not, they will haue the thirde, and ſo vpwardes vntill they haue founde a good nource. But I let you to wete (you princeſſes and great ladies) that it is more daunger for the children to chaunge diuerſe mylkes: then vnto the old men, to eate dyuerſe meates. Wee ſee dayly by experience, that without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon there dieth more children of noble women, then children of women of the meaner eſtate. And we will not ſay, that it is for that they do flatter their children more, nor for that the wiues of labourers do eate fine meates: but that it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth oft times, that the children of a poore woman: doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat, nor drinke: but of one kinde of meate, or milke in .ii. yeares, and the childe of a Ladye ſhall chaung and alter .iii. nources in .ii. monethes. If prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and great ladies were circumſpect in chouſing their nources, and that they did loke whether they were hole without diſeaſes, and honeſt in their maners, and would not regarde ſo much the importunitie of their ſutes: the mothers ſhould excuſe them ſelues from many ſorowes, &amp; the children like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhould be deliuered from many diſeaſes. One of the moſt renowmed princes in times paſt, was <hi>Titus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Vaſpaſyan,</hi> and brother of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian. Lampridius</hi> ſaieth, that this good Emperour <hi>Titus</hi> (the moſt parte of his lyfe) was ſubiect to greuous diſeaſes and infirmities of his perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, and the cauſe was, for that when he was yong he was geuen to a ſyck nourſe to be nouriſhed, ſo that this good Emperour ſucking her dugge but a while, was conſtrained to paſſe all his lyfe in paine.</p>
                     <p>Thirdely, Princeſſes &amp; great Ladies ought to know, and vnderſtand the complexion of their children, to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> accordyng to the ſame they myghte ſeke pitieful nources, that is to wete, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> child wer cholorycke, flegmaticke, ſanguine, or melancolye: For looke what humour the child is of, of the ſame qualitie the milke of the nource ſhould be. If vnto an old corrupted ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they miniſtre medecines, conformable to hys diſeaſes for to cure hym: why then ſhould not the mother ſeeke a holeſome nource to the tender babe, agreable to his complexion, to nouriſh hym: And if thou ſayeſt it is iuſte, that the fleſh
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21411:142"/>
old and corrupted be ſuſteined: I tel the likewiſe that it is much more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that the children ſhould be curiouſly &amp; well nouriſhed, to multiplye the world. For in the end we do not ſay, it is time that the yong leaue the bread for the aged: but contrarye it is time that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old leaue the bread for the yong. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in the booke <hi>De ſecretis ſecretorum,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iunius Ruſticus,</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .x. boke <hi>de geſtis Perſarum</hi> ſay, that the vnfortunat king <hi>Darius</hi> (who was ouercome by <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> the great) had a doughter of a merueilous beautie. And they ſaye that the nource which gaue ſucke to this doughter all the time that ſhe did nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe it, did neither eate nor drinke any thing but poiſon: and at the end of .iii, yeares, when the child was weyned, &amp; plucked from the dugge, ſhe did eate nothing but <hi>Colubers,</hi> and other venemous wormes. I haue heard ſay many times that the Emperours had a cuſtome, to nouriſh their heires, &amp; children with poyſons when they were yong: to the entent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould not be hurt by poyſon, afterward whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wer old. And this errour commeth of thoſe which preſume much, and know litel. And therfore I ſay, that I haue heard ſay, without ſayeng I haue read it. For ſome declare hiſtories, more for that they haue heard ſay of others: then for that they haue read them ſelues. The truth in this caſe is, that as we vſe at this preſent, to were Cheynes of gold about our necks, or Iewels on our fingers, ſo did y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gentils in times paſt a rynge on their fingers, or ſome Iewel in their boſome repleniſhed with poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Panims</hi> did neither feare hel, nor hope for heauen, they had that cuſtome, for if at any times in battaile they ſhould find them ſelues in diſtreſſe, they had rather end their liues with poiſon, then to receyue any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury of their enemies. Then if it were true that thoſe Princes had bene nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poiſon, they would not haue caried it about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue ended their lyues. Further I ſaye, that the princes of <hi>Perſia</hi> did vſe when they had any child borne, to geue him milke to ſucke agreable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> complectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had. Since this doughter of <hi>Darius</hi> was of melancholye humour, they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bring her vp with venim and poyſon, becauſe all thoſe which are pure malancolye, do liue with ſorow, &amp; dye with pleaſure. <hi>Ingnacius</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> in the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .v. emperours <hi>Palleolus</hi> (which wer valiaunt emperours in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>) ſaieth, that the ſecond of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name called <hi>Palleolles</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hardie, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the .xl. yeares of his age ſo troubled with infirmities and diſeaſes, that alwayes of the .xii. monethes of the yeare he was in his bed ſycke ix. mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes: and beyng ſo ſicke as he was, the affaires and buſines of the empire were but ſlenderly done &amp; loked vnto. For the prince can not haue ſo ſmall a feuer, but the people in the commen wealth muſt haue it double. This Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Palleolus</hi> had a wyfe, whoſe name was <hi>Huldouina,</hi> the which after ſhe had brought all the Phiſitions of <hi>Aſia</hi> vnto her huſbande, and that ſhe had miniſtred vnto him all the medecins ſhe could learne to healpe him, and in the end ſeyng nothing auaile: ther came by chaunce an olde woman, a Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian borne, who preſumed to haue great knowlege in herbes, and ſayd vnto the empreſſe noble Empreſſe <hi>Huldouina,</hi> If thou wilt that the Emperour thy huſband doe liue longe, ſee that thou chafe, angre, and vexe him euerye weeke at the leaſt twyſe: for he is of a pure malancoly humour, and therfore he that doth him pleaſure, augmenteth his diſeaſe: &amp; he that vexeth him ſhal prolong his life. The empreſſe <hi>Huldouina</hi> folowed the counſel of this Greeke
<pb facs="tcp:21411:143"/>
woman, which was occaſion that the emperour lyued afterwardes ſounde and hole many yeres: ſo that of the .ix. monethes which he was accuſtomed to be ſicke euery yeare: in .xx. yeares afterwardes he was not ſicke .iii. mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes. For wher as this Greke woman commaunded the empreſſe to angre her huſbande but twiſe in the weeke, ſhe accuſtomeablye angred hym .iiii. times in the daye.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the good mother ought to take hede, that the nource be verye temperate in eatyng, ſo that ſhe ſhould eate litell of diuerſe meates, and of thoſe few diſhes ſhe ſhould not eate to much. To vnderſtand that thyng ye muſt know, that the white milke is no other then blod, which is ſoden, and that whiche cauſeth the good or euill bloud, commeth oft tymes of no other thyng, but that eyther the perſonne is temperate, or els a glutton in eating: and therfore it is a thyng both healthfull and neceſſary, that the nource that nouriſheth the child do eate good meates: for among men and women it is a general rule, that in litle eating, ther is no daunger: and of to much eating, there is no profit. As all the Philoſophers ſaye, the wolfe is one of the bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes that deuoureth moſt, and is moſt gredyeſt, and therfore he is moſt fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of al the ſheppardes. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his third booke <hi>de Animalibus</hi> ſayeth, that when the wolfe doth once feele her ſelfe great with yong, in all her lyfe after ſhe neuer ſuffereth her ſelfe to be couppled with the wolfe againe: For otherwyſe, if the wolfe ſhould yearely bryng forth .vii. or .viii. whealpes (as commonly ſhe doth) and the ſhepe but one lambe, there woulde be in ſhorte ſpace more wolues then ſhepe. Beſides all this the wolfe hath an other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie, whyche is, that though ſhe be a beaſt moſt deuouryng and gredy: yet when ſhe hath whealped, ſhe eateth very temperately, and it is to the end to nouryſhe here whealpes, and to haue good milke. And beſydes that ſhe doth eate but once in the day, the whych the dogge wolfe doth prouide, both for the byche, and her whealpes. Truly it is a monſterous thyng to ſee, and noyſome to heare, and no leſſe ſclaunderous to ſpeake, that a wolfe whyche geueth ſucke to .viii. whealpes, eateth but one onely kynde of meate: and a woman whych geueth ſucke but to one chylde alone, will eate of eyght ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of meates. And the cauſe hereof is, that the beaſt doth not eate, but to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteine nature: and the woman doth not eate, but to ſatiſfie her pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Princeſſes and great Ladies ought to watche narrowly, to know whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and how much the nources doe eate, whiche doe nouriſh their children: For the child is ſo tender, and the milke ſo delicate, that with eatyng of ſondrye meates they become corrupte, and with eatyng muche they waxe fat. If the children ſuck thoſe which are fatte and groſſe, they are commonly ſicke: and if they ſucke milke corrupted, they ofte tymes go to bed hole, and in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng be found dead. <hi>Iſodore</hi> in his etimologies ſaieth, that menne of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince of <hi>Thrace</hi> were ſo cruell, that the one dyd eate the other, and they dyd not onely this, but alſo furder to ſhew more their immanitie, in the ſculles of thoſe that were deade, they dranke the bloud of him that was lately alyue. Thoughe men were ſo cruell to eate mennes fleſh, and to drynk the bloud of the vaines: yet the women <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THe Princeſſes and great ladies may know by this example, what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference there is betwene the women of <hi>Thrace,</hi> which are fed with net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telles only, and haue brought forth ſuche fierce men: and the women of our tyme, whiche through their delicate and exceſſiue eatyng, bryng forthe ſuche weake and feable children.</p>

                        </gap>enym. The reaſon hereof is apparant and manifeſt ynough, for if we doe forbyd the fat meates which lieth in the ſtomacke: we ſhould then much more forbidde the moyſt wine, whyche waſheth all the vaines of the body. And further I ſay, that as the child hath no other nouriſhement but the milke only, &amp; that the milke proceadeth of bloud, &amp; that bloud is nouriſhed of the wine, and that wine is naturally whot: from the firſt to the laſt. I ſay, the woman whyche drinketh wine, and geueth the child ſucke, doth as ſhe that maketh a greate fire vnder the panne, wher ther is but a litle milke: ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> panne burneth, and the milke runneth ouer. I will not denaye, but that ſome times it maye chaunce, that the child ſhalbe of a ſtrong complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the nource of a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and weake nature: and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the child would more ſubſtanciall milke, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not able to geue it him. In ſuch a caſe (though with other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges milke may be conferred) I allow that the nource drink a litel wine: but it ought to be ſo litel, and ſo well watered, that it ſhould rather be to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye the vnſauorines of the water, then for to taſt of any ſauour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine. I do not ſpeake this without a cauſe, for the nource being ſicke, and feable of her ſelfe, and her milke not ſubſtancial, it ofte times moueth her to eate more then neceſſitie requireth, and to drinke wine which is ſomewhat nutritiue: ſo that they ſuppoſyng to giue the nource triacle, do giue her poyſon to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy her child. Thoſe excellent &amp; auncient Romaines, if they had bene in our time, and that we had deſerued to haue bene in their time (thoughe our time for beyng Chriſtians is better) they had ſaued vs from this trauaile, for they were ſo temperat in eatyng meates, and ſo abſtinent in drynkyng wynes, that they dyd not only refrayne the drinkyng therof, but alſo they would not abyde to ſmell it. For it was a greater ſhame vnto a Romayne woman to drynke wyne, then to be deuorced from her huſbande. <hi>Dioniſius Alicarnaſeus</hi> in his boke of the lawes of the Romaynes ſayed, that <hi>Romulus</hi> was the fyrſte founder of Rome, and that he occupyed hym ſelfe more in buildyng houſes, to amplifie Rome: then in conſtituting lawes, for the gouernement of the commen wealth. But emongeſt .xv. lawes which he made, the ſeuenth therof was, that no Romaine woman on paine of death ſhold be ſo hardy to drinke wine within the walles of Rome. The ſame Hiſtorian ſaieth, that by the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of this law the cuſtome was in Rome, that when any Romain La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
<pb facs="tcp:21411:144"/>
would drinke wine, or make any ſolempne feaſt, ſhe muſt nedes goe oute of Rome, where euery one hadde their gardens and dwellyng place: becauſe the ſmell alſo of wine was prohibited and forhidden women within the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite of Rome. If <hi>Plinie</hi> do not deceyue vs in his .xxiiii. booke of his naturall hiſtory, It was an auncient cuſtome in Rome, that at eche time that paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes met, both men and women, they did kiſſe the one the other in the face, in token of peace: and this ceremony began firſt, for that they would ſmel whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the woman hadde dronke any wine. And if perchaunce ſhe ſauored of wine, the Cenſor mighte haue baniſhed her from Rome. And if her kinſeman found her without Rome, he might frely and without any daunger of lawe put her to death: becauſe within the circuite and walles of Rome, no pryuat man by Iuſtice could put any Romaine to death. As aboue is reherſed, <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> was he which ordeined the paine for dronkardes: and <hi>Ruptilius</hi> was he, which ordeined the paine for adulterers. And betwene <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius,</hi> there was .xxxii. yeares: ſo that they ordeyned this ſtrayght lawe for dronckardes, a long time before they dyd the law for adulterers. For if a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man be a dronckarde, or harlot, truly they are both great faultes, and I can not tell whether of them is worſt: for beyng a harlot, the woman loſeth her name, and for being a dronckard, ſhe loſeth her fame, and the huſbande hys goods. Then if women for the honeſtie of their perſonnes only are bound to be temperat in eating and drincking: the woman which nouriſheth &amp; giueth the child ſucke, ought to be much more corrected, and ſober in this caſe. For in her is concurrante not only the grauitie of their perſonnes: but the health and lyfe alſo of the creature, whiche ſhe nouriſheth. Therfore it is mete, that the nource be kepte from wine, ſince the honour of the one, and the lyfe of the other is in peryll.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princeſſes and great Ladies ought to take hede, that their nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be not gotten with child. And the reaſon herof is, that in that time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the woman is with child, her natural courſe is ſtopped, and that corruption is mingled with the pure bloud: ſo that ſhe thinking to giue the child mylke to nouriſh it, geueth it poiſon to deſtroye it. And nothyng can be more vniuſte, then to put the childe (whiche is alredy borne, and aliue) in daunger, for that which is as yet vnborne, and dead, it is a wonderfull thinge (for a man that wil curiouſly note and marke thinges) to ſee the brute beaſtes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the tyme they bryng vp their litell ones, they will not conſent to accompanie with the males, nor the males wil follow the females: and that that is moſt to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yet is, to ſee what paſſith betwene byrdes: for the ſhe ſparrowe will not ſuffer the male in any wiſe to towche or come nere her, till her litle ones be great and able to flye, and moch leſſe to ſit apon any egges to hatch them till the other be fled and gone, <hi>Plurarche</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .vii. of his regiment of princes ſaieth, that <hi>Gneus Fuluius</hi> (Coſin germain of <hi>Pompeius</hi>) beyng conſull in Rome, fell in loue with a yong mayden of <hi>Capua</hi> being an orphane, whether he fled for the plague. This maiden was called <hi>Sabina,</hi> &amp; when ſhe was great with child by this conſull, ſhe brought forth a doughter whom they called faire <hi>Druſia:</hi> and truly ſhe was more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended for her beautie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for her honeſty. For ofteti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes it happeneth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the faire and diſhoneſt women leue their children ſo euyll taught, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of their mothers they inherite litel goods, &amp; much diſhonour. This
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21411:144"/>
                        <hi>Sabina</hi> therfore being deliuered (as it was the cuſtome of Rome) ſhe did with her owne breſtes nouriſh her doughter <hi>Druſia:</hi> during y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which time ſhe was gotten with chyld, by one of the knightes of this Conſul, to whom (as to hys ſeruaunt) he had geuen her to kepe. Wherfore when the Conſull was hereof aduertiſed, and that notwithſtandyng ſhe gaue her doughter ſucke: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the knight ſhould be immediatly beheded, &amp; his louer <hi>Sabina</hi> forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be caſt into a wel. The day of execution came that both theſe parties ſhould ſuffer, wherfore the wofull <hi>Sabina</hi> ſent to beſeche the conſul, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it would pleaſe him before her death to geue her audience of one ſole word y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe would ſpeake vnto hym, the which being come, in the preſence of them all ſhe ſayed vnto him. O <hi>Gneus Fuluius,</hi> knowe thou I did not cal the to thende thou ſhul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me lyfe, but becauſe I would not dye before I had ſene thy face: thoughe thou of thy ſelfe ſhuldeſt remember, that as I am a fraile woman, and fel into ſin with the in <hi>Capua:</hi> ſo I might fal now (as I haue done) with another in Rome. For we women are ſo fraile in this caſe, during the time of this our miſerable life: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none can keape her ſelfe ſure, from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſaultes of the weake fleaſh. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſul <hi>Gneus Fuluius</hi> to theſe wordes aunſwered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal knoweth <hi>Sabina,</hi> what grefe it is to my wofull harte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I of thy ſecret offence ſhuld be an open ſcourge. For greater honeſty it is for men to hyde your frailnes: then openly to punyſhe your offences. But what wilt thou I ſhould do in this caſe, conſidering the offence thou haſt comitted? by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal gods I ſweare vnto the, &amp; againe I ſweare, that I had rather thou ſhouldeſt ſecreatly haue procured y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of ſome man: then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> openly in thys wiſe thou ſhould haue ſlaundered my houſe. For thou knoweſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the common prouerbe in rome. It is better to die in honour, then to liue in infamie. And thinke thou not <hi>(Sabina)</hi> that I do codemne the to die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou forgoteſt thy faieth vnto my perſon, and that thou gaueſt thy ſelf to hym whiche kepte the: for ſinſe thou werte not my wyfe, the libertie thou haddeſt to come with me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Capua</hi> to Rome, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfe ſame thou haddeſt to go with another fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rome to <hi>Capua.</hi> It is an euil thing for vitious men, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vices of others, wherin they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues are faultie. The cauſe why I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dempne the to die, is for the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce of the old law y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that no nourſe or woman geuyng ſucke, ſhould on paine of death be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten with child, truly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law is veray iuſt. For honeſt women do not ſuffer, that in geuyng her child ſucke at her breaſt, ſhe ſhould hide another in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes. Theſe wordes paſſed betwene <hi>Gneus Fuluius</hi> the conſul, and the ladye <hi>Sabina</hi> of <hi>Capua.</hi> Howbeit as <hi>Plutarche</hi> ſaieth, in that place the conſul had pitie vpon her, &amp; ſhewed her fauoure, baniſhyng her vpon condicion, neuer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne to Rome againe. <hi>Cinna Catullus</hi> in the forth boke of the .xxii. conſulles ſaieth, that <hi>Caius Fabricus</hi> was on of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt notable conſulles that euer was in rome, &amp; was ſore afflicted w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> diſſeaſes in his life, onely becauſe he was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhed .iiii. monethes with the milke of a nource being great with child: &amp; for feare of this, they locked the nource with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> child in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the veſtal vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, wherfor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of .iii. yeres they wer kepte.

milke, &amp; furder ſhould geue me occaſion to doe iuſtice vpon her perſon: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keaping them ſo ſhut vp, we are occaſion to preſerue their lyfe, and alſo oure children from peril. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> in his librarie and <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſayth, in the life of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> that in the Iſles of <hi>Baleares</hi> ther was a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, that the nources of yong children (whether they were their owne, or others) ſhould be ſeuered from their huſbandes for the ſpace of .ii. yeares. And the woman whych at that tyme (though it were by her huſbande) were with child though they did not chaſtice her as an adultreſſe: yet euery man ſpake euill of her as of an offender. Duryng the tyme of theſe ii. yeres, to the end the huſband ſhould take no other wife, they commaunded that he ſhold take a concubine, or that he ſhould bye a ſlaue, whoſe companye he myghte vſe as hys wyfe: for amongeſt theſe barbarous he was honoured moſt, who had .ii. wyues, the one with childe, and thother not. By theſe examples aboue recyted, Princeſſes and great Ladies may ſee, what watche and care they ought to take in chouſyng their nources, that they be honeſt, ſinſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not onlye the healthe of their chyldren: but alſo the good fame of their houſes.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth condicion is, that princeſſes and great Ladyes ought to ſee their nources haue good condicions, ſo that they be not trobleſome, proude, harlots, lyers, malicious, nor flatterers: for the viper hath not ſo muche poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as the woman whyche is euell conditioned. It litell auayleth a man to take wyne from a woman, to entreate her to eate litel, and to withdraw her from her huſband, if of her owne nature ſhe be hatefull, and euell ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e) be euell conditioned: trulye ſhe is euell troubeled, and the houſe wherein ſhe dwelleth euell combred. For ſuche one doeth importune the lorde, trobleth the ladye, putteth in hazard the childe, and aboue all is not contented with her ſelfe. Finallye fathers for geuynge to much libertie to their nources, oftetimes are the cauſe of many practiſes which they do: wherwith in the end, they are greued with the death of their children which foloweth. Amongeſt all theſe which I haue red I ſaye, that of the auncient Romaine princes, of ſo good a father as <hi>Druſius Ge manicus</hi> was, neuer came ſo wycked a ſonne as <hi>Caligula</hi> was, beyng the fourth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of Rome: for the hiſtoriographers were not ſatiſfyed to enryche and prayſe the excellencies of hys father, neither ceaſed they to blame and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hende the infamyes of his ſonne. And they ſay, that hys naughtines procea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not of the mother which bare hym: but of the nource which gaue hym ſucke. For oftimes it chaunceth that the tree is grene and good, when it is planted, and afterwardes it becommeth drye, and wythered, only for beyng caryed into another place. <hi>Dion</hi> the greke in the ſecond boke of <hi>Ceſars</hi> ſayeth, that a curſed woman of <hi>Campania</hi> called <hi>Preſſilla,</hi> nouryſhed and gaue ſucke vnto thys wycked childe. She had agaynſt al nature of women her breaſtes as heary as the berdes of men, and beſides that, in runnyng a horſe, hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng her ſtaffe, ſhoting in the Croſbowe, fewe yong men in rome were to be compared vnto her. It chaunced on a time that as ſhe was geuyng ſucke to <hi>Caligula,</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe was angry, ſhe tore in peces a yong child, &amp; with the bludde
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21411:145"/>
there of annoynted her breaſtes: and ſo ſhe made <hi>Caligula</hi> the yong childe, to ſucke together both blud and milke. The ſayed <hi>Dion</hi> in hys booke of the lyfe of this Emperour <hi>Caligula</hi> ſayeth, that the women of <hi>Campania</hi> (whereof the ſayed <hi>Preſcilla</hi> was) had this cuſtome, that when they would geue their teat to the childe firſte they dyd anoynte the nipple with the bludde of a hedge hogge, to the end their children myght be more fyerce and cruell.</p>
                     <p>And ſo was this <hi>Caligula,</hi> for he was not contented to kyll a man onely, but alſo he ſucked the bludde that remayned on his ſwerde, and lyked it of with his tong. The excellent Poet <hi>Homer</hi> meanyng to ſpeake playnely of the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of <hi>Pirrus</hi> ſayed in his <hi>Odiſſe</hi> of him, ſuche wordes: <hi>Pirrus</hi> was borne in <hi>Grece,</hi> nouriſhed in <hi>Archadye,</hi> and brought vp with tigers milke, whiche is a cruel beaſt. As if more plainelye he had ſayed, <hi>Pirrus</hi> for beyng borne in <hi>Grece</hi> was Sage, for that he was brought vp in <hi>Archadie</hi> he was ſtrong and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragyous, and for to haue ſucked Tigars milke, he was veray proude, and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uell. Hereof maye be gathered, that the great Gretian <hi>Pirrus,</hi> for wantinge of good milke, was ouercome with euell condicions.</p>
                     <p>The ſelfe ſame hiſtorian <hi>Dion</hi> ſayeth in the lyfe of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that he was a great dronckarde, And the cauſe herof was, that the nource dyd not onelye drynke wyne: but alſo ſhe weined the child with ſoppes dypped in wyne. And wythout doubte the curſed woman had done leſſe euill, if in the ſteade of milke ſhe had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the child poiſon, wythout teachinge it to drinke wine: wherfore afterwardes he loſt his renowme. For truly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romayne Empire had loſt lytell if <hi>Tiberius</hi> had died beyng a child: and it had wonne muche, if he had neauer knowen what drinkyng of wyne had mente.</p>
                     <p>I haue declared all that whyche before is mencioned, to thentente that Princeſſes and great Ladyes myghte be aduertiſed, that ſinſe in not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhyng their children, they ſhewe them ſelues crewel: yet at the leaſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidyng for them good nourſes, they ſhould ſhew them ſelues pitifull.

King <hi>Philip</hi> (whych was father of kyng <hi>Alexander</hi>) always councelled his ſonne, that he ſhould lead with him to the warres valiaunt captaines, to conquere the world: and that out of his realmes and dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s he ſhould take &amp; choſe the wyſeſt men, and beſt experimented to gouerne the empire.

<pb facs="tcp:21411:146"/>
men is gotten and wonne. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great therefore beyng in <hi>Babilon,</hi> after he had conquered all the countrye, ſince all the citye was vitious, and hys armye ſo long without warres, ſome of his owne men began to robbe one another, others to playe their owne, ſome to force women, and others to make banquettes and feaſtes, and when ſome were droncke, others rayſed quarels, ſtriffes, and dyſcentions: ſo that a man could not tell whether was greater, the ruſte in their armours, or the corruptions in their cuſtomes. For the property of mans malice is, that when the gate is open to idlenes, infy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite vyces enter into the houſe.</p>

                        <hi>Alexander</hi> the great ſeing the dyſſolution which was in his armye, and the loſſe which myght enſewe hereof vnto his great empire, commaunded ſtreightly that they ſhould make a ſhew and iuſte thoroughe <hi>Babilon,</hi> to the end that the men of warre ſhould excerſiſe their forces thereby.

                     <p>This good Prince not contented to excerſiſe his armye ſo, but ordeined, that daily in his preſence the philoſophers ſhould diſpute, and the queſtion wherin they ſhold dyſpute, <hi>Alexander</hi> him ſelfe would propounde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherof fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that the great <hi>Alexander</hi> was made certayne of that wherin he doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and ſo by his wiſedom all men exercyſed their craftes and wittes.</p>
                     <p>For in this tyme of idlenes, the bokes wer no leſſe marred with duſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not opened: then the weapons were with ruſt, which were not occupied. There is a booke of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> intituled the queſtions of <hi>Babilon,</hi> where is ſayed, that <hi>Alexander</hi> propounded, the Philoſophers diſputed: the pryncipalles of <hi>Perſia</hi> replied, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> determined. And ſo continued in diſputations as long as <hi>Alexander</hi> dyd eate: for at the table of <hi>Alexander,</hi> one day the captaines reaſoned of matters of warre, and another day the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers dyſputed of their philoſophie. <hi>Blundus</hi> ſayeth in the booke intituled, <hi>Italia Illuſtrata,</hi> that amonge the Princes of <hi>Perſia</hi> their was a cuſtome, that none could ſit downe at the table, vnleſſe he were a kyng that had ouercome an other kyng in battaile, &amp; none coulde ſpeake at their table but a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.

Kynge <hi>Alexander,</hi> dyd eate but one meale in the daye, and therefore the firſte queſtion that he propounded vnto them was. That the man which did not eate but once in the day, at what houre it was beſt to eate, for the health of his perſonne, and whether it ſhold be in the mornyng, none dayes, or nyght? This queſtion was debated among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> philoſophers, wherof euery one to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his opinion, alleaged many foundacions. For no leſſe care haue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in their mindes, to iſſewe out of them diſputations victorious: then the

valiaunt captaines haue in aduenturing their perſones, to vanquyſhe theyr enemyes. It was determined: as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion in his <hi>Probleames,</hi> that the man whyche eateth but once in the daye, ſhoulde eate a litell before nyght: for it auayleth greatly to the health of the body, that when the dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion beginneth in the ſtomacke, a man taketh hys firſt ſteape.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond queſtion that <hi>Alexander</hi> propounded was, what age the child ſhould haue, when he ſhould be weyned from the dugge. And the occaſion of this queſtion was, for that he had begoten a yong doughter of a Quene of the <hi>Amazones,</hi> the whiche at that tyme dyd ſuche: and for to knowe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were tyme or not to weyne her, there was great dyſputations. For the childe was nowe great to ſucke, and weake to weyne, I haue declared this hiſtory for no other purpoſe, but to ſhew howe in <hi>Babilon</hi> this queſtion was diſputed, before kyng <hi>Alexander,</hi> that is to wete, how many yeares the chyld ought to haue before it were weyned from the teate: for at that tyme, they are ſo ignoraunt, that they cannot demaunde that that is good, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of that whych is nought. In that caſe a man ought to know, as the tymes are variable, and the regions and prouynce dyuers: ſo lykewyſe haue they ſondrye wayes of bryngynge vp, and nouryſhyng their chyldren. For there is aſmuche dyfference betwene the contryes of one, from the contries of others, in dyeng, and buryeng the dead bodyes, as there hath ben varye<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ties in the worlde, by waye of nouryſhyng and bryngyng vp of children.</p>

                     <p>IT is not muche from our purpoſe, if I declare here ſome olde examples of thoſe whych are paſte. <hi>Strabo</hi> in hys boke <hi>de ſitu Orbis</hi> ſayeth, that after the <hi>Aſſirians,</hi> (whych were the firſt that reigned in the world) the <hi>Siconians</hi> had ſignorie, (whych lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge tyme after were called <hi>Archades</hi>) whych were great and famous wraſtlers, and ſcolemaſters at the fence, from whom came the beſt and firſt maſters of fence, the whyche the Romaynes kepte alwayes for their playes: for as <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> ſayeth, the romaynes founde it by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that ther wer no better men in weighty affaires, then thoſe of <hi>Spaine:</hi> nor no people apter to plaies and paſtimes, then thoſe of <hi>Archadia.</hi> As thoſe <hi>Siconians</hi> were auncient, ſo they were marueilouſly addicted to follyes, and ſuperſtitious in theyr vſages and cuſtomes, for among other they honored for their god the Moone. And duryng the time that ſhe was ſene, they gaue their children ſucke, imagenyng that if the Moone ſhyned vpon the breaſtes of the mother, it would do much good vnto the child. The auctour herof is <hi>Sinna Catullus,</hi> in the boke <hi>De educandis pueris.</hi> And as the ſame hiſtorian ſayeth the egiptians were great enemyes to the <hi>Siconians,</hi> ſo that all that whych the one dyd alowe, the others dyd reproue, as it appereth. For aſmuche as the <hi>Siconians</hi> loued oliues and achornes, they were clothed with lynnen, and worſhypped the Moone for theyr god. The Egiptians for the contrary had no olyues, neyther they nouriſhed any okes, they dyd were no lynnen, they worſhypped the ſonne for their god, and aboue all, as the <hi>Siconians</hi> dyd geue theyr chyldren ſucke whyles the Moone dyd ſhyne: ſo the egyptians gaue theyr chyldred ſucke whyles the ſonne dyd ſhyne.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:147"/>Amonge other folyes of the <hi>Caldians</hi> this was one, that they honoured the fier for their god, ſo that he that was not maried, could not lighte fier in hys houſe: bycauſe they ſayed the cuſtodye of Goddes ſhoulde be committed to none, but to maryed and auncient men. They had in mariages ſuche order, that the daye when any children dyd marie, the prieſtes came into his houſe to lyghte new fier: the which neuer ought to be put out, vntill the houre of his death. And if perchaunce during the life of the huſband, and of the wife, they ſhould finde the fier ded and put out: the mariage betwene them was dede, and vndone, yea thoughe they had ben .xl. yeares togethers before in ſuch ſorte. And of this occaſion came the prouerbe which of many is redde, and of fewe vnderſtanded: that is to wete prouoke me not ſo muche that I throwe water into the fier. The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> vſed ſuch wordes, when they woulde deuorce and ſeperate the mariage: for if the woman were ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with her huſbande, in caſtinge a lytel water on the fier, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye ſhe myghte marye with another. And if the huſbande in lyke maner dyd putte oure the fier, he mighte with another woman contracte mariage. I haue not bene maried as yet, but I ſuppoſe there are manye chriſtians whych wyſheth to haue at this preſent the liberty of the <hi>Caldes:</hi> for I am wel aſſured there are manye men which would caſt water on the fier, to eſcape from their wiues: alſo I ſweare, that their would be a number of women whiche would not onely put out the fier, but alſo the aſhes, imbers, &amp; coles, to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues fre, and to be dyſpatched of their huſbandes, and ineſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from thoſe whiche are ielous.</p>
                     <p>Therfore returnyng to oure matter, the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> made before the fier, all notable thinges in their lawe, as before their God. For they dyd eate before the fier, they ſlepte before the fier. They did contracte before the fier, and the mothers dyd neuer geue the children ſucke, but before the fier. For the milke (as they imagined) dyd profite the child when it ſucked before the fier, which was their god. The aucthour of this that is ſpoken, is <hi>Cynna Catullus.</hi> The <hi>Mauritaines</hi> whiche at this preſent are called the realmes of <hi>Maruechi,</hi> were in tymes paſt warlyke men, of whom the Romaines had greate victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the more valiaunt the men wer in the warres: ſo much more ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious their wiues were in ſorceries, charmes, and enchauntements. For the huſband that is long abſent from his wife ought not to maruaile though in her be found ſome faultes. <hi>Cicero</hi> in the booke <hi>De natura deorum,</hi> and muche more at large <hi>Bocas</hi> ſayeth, that as many men and women, as were in that realme: ſo many Gods there were among the people. For euery one had one perticuler God to him ſelfe: ſo that the God of the one, was not the God of the other. And this was to be vnderſtand in the weke daies: For in the holy and feſtiuall daies they had other Gods, the which altogethers they dyd ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. The maner that they had in choſyng Gods when a woman was with child was this. She went to the ſacrificer of the idoll, and told him that ſhe was great with child, and beſought him to geue her a god for her childe. And the ſacrificer gaue her a lytell idoll of ſtone, gold, ſiluer, or of woode, the which the mother hanged at the necke of the child. And as often as the child dyd ſucke the dugge, ſo ofte the mother putteth the idoll one his face. For otherwyſe ſhe had not geuen hym a droppe of mylke to ſucke, vnleſſe firſt ſhe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21411:147"/>
had conſecrated to the God the mylke of her breſte. That which I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken is litle in reſpect of that I will ſpeake, whiche is, that if perchaunce the chylde died before the time, or that any younge man by ſome perylous my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhappe died before he was ſomewhat aged: the fathers and kinſmen of the dead did aſſemble, and came to the Idoll of him, and eyther ſtoned it, honge it, drue it, brent it, or els they caſte it into the deape well, ſayinge, that ſithe the Gods did kyll man without reaſon: that they might lawfully kyl them by iuſtice. The ſame <hi>Bochas</hi> in the ſeconde booke <hi>De natura Deorum</hi> ſaieth, that the <hi>Allobroges</hi> had a cuſtome, that thoſe whiche were prieſtes of the Gods ſhould from the wombe of their mothers be choſen vnto that dignitie. And aſſone as the childe was borne, before he taſted the mylke of the breſte, they caried it into a prieſtes houſe: for they had a cuſtome, that the man which had taſted the thinges of the worlde, merited not to ſerue the Gods in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. One of the lawes that the ſayed prieſtes had, was that not onely they could not by violence ſhed any bloud, nor yet ſee it, neyther touche it: ſo that immediatly as the prieſte ſhould by chaunce touche mannes bloud, euen ſo ſone he loſte his prieſthode. This lawe afterwardes was ſo narrowely lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vnto, that the prieſtes of the <hi>Allobroges</hi> dyd not onely not ſhedde drinke nor touche mans bloude when they were nowe men: but alſo when they were litle infants (thoſe that ſhould be prieſts) they gaue them no milke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breaſte at al. And this was their reaſon. That to ſucke milke was no other, but to drinke whyte bloude: for white milke is but ſodden bloude, and redde bloud is but rawe mylke. <hi>Pulio</hi> in the booke <hi>De educandis pueris</hi> ſaieth, that the auncientes had a certaine kinde of reedes, that breaking it in ſondre, there iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued white mylke, wherewith they accuſtomed to nouriſhe their children: but let it be as it is, that this lawe prohibite children their mylke, which here after ſhould be made prieſtes of the temples: me thinketh it is a tricke rather of ſuperſtitious Sorcerers, then of religious prieſtes. For there is neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nor humaine lawe that wyll forbidde, or prohibite anye ſuche thinge, without the whiche mans life can not endure. Theſe were the maners and cuſtomes that the auncientes had in the nouriture of their children.</p>
                     <p>And in dede I marueile not at that they did, for the Gentils eſtemed this curſed Idoll for as great a God: as we Chriſtians doe the true and liuyng God. I was willing to declare all theſe antiquities, to the ende that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and great ladies ſhould haue pleaſure in reading them and knowing them: but not to that ende they ſhould imitate and folowe them in any kynd of thing. For according to the faithe of our Chriſtian religion, as ſure as we be of the offences that thoſe did vnto God, through folowinge thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions: ſo ſure we are of the good ſeruices whiche we doe vnto God in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakyng them. Howe longe tyme the mothers ought to geue their chyldren ſucke, and what age they ought to weyne them, not for that whiche I haue redde, nor for that whiche I haue demaunded in this caſe I am able to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: but for as muche as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaieth, in the booke aboue named, that the chylde at the moſte ought to ſucke but twoo yeares, and at the leaſte one yeare and an halfe. For if he ſucke leſſe, he is in daunger to be ſicke, and if he ſucke more, he ſhalbe alwayes tender. I wyll not omitte that whiche <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſaieth, in the fourth booke of his common wealth. And hereof
<pb facs="tcp:21411:148"/>
                        <hi>Boccace</hi> alſo maketh mention in the thirde booke <hi>De natura Deorum,</hi> that when <hi>Alexander</hi> the great paſſed into <hi>India,</hi> amongeſt other renowmed Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, there was one with hym called <hi>Arethus,</hi> who (as by chaunce he was in <hi>Niſſa</hi> an auncient citie of <hi>India</hi>) there came a man of that Countrey to ſhewe him ſuche antiquities as were there. <hi>Arethus</hi> the Philoſopher behelde them as a ſage and wyſe man. For the ſimple man onely beholdeth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges, and howe they ſeme: but the ſage man enquireth and demaundeth of the cauſes, and from whence they came. Amonge other thinges he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed this good Philoſopher a great houſe, being in the ende of the citie, and therein were many women, whereof euery one of them had a chambre, and in euery chambre there was twoo beddes, and adioyning to the one herbes were ſowen in maner of nettels, and adioyning to the other there was a kynde of twigges, as of Roſemary, and in the myddes of the houſe, there were many graues of ſmall chyldren. The Philoſopher <hi>Arethus</hi> aſked why that houſe was ſo great, and the <hi>Indian</hi> aunſwered. This houſe is to nouriſh the chyldren whiche are orphanes, when they be of their parentes or frendes abandoned. For it is a cuſtome in this citie, that immediatly when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of one chylde dieth, the citie then taketh hym for her ſonne. And from that tyme forwarde he is called the childe of the citie, whiche nouriſheth hym: and not the chylde of the father, whiche begotte hym.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arethus</hi> the Philoſopher ſecondarely aſked him, why there were ſo many women in that houſe, without any man among them? whereunto the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> aunſwered: in this countrey there is a cuſtome, that the women are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from their huſbandes, all the tyme they geue their children ſucke: For the wyll of our God is, that the woman be not in company with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande after ſhe is with childe, and this not onely vntyll ſuche tyme as ſhe is delyuered: but alſo vntil ſuch time as the childe be weyned from the breaſte.</p>
                     <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Arethus</hi> thirdly demaunded hym, why euery one had her chambre ſeuerally? the <hi>Indian</hi> aunſwered. Thou knoweſt that nowe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reigneth ſo muche malice in the woman, that ſhe alwayes enuieth the felicitie of an other. And if they were altogethers, they would haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt them ſuche quarrelles and debates, that they woulde corrupte the milke whiche they ſhould geue to the childe.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly the philoſopher <hi>Arethus</hi> aſked, why in euery chambre there was a great bedde, and a litle pallet, ſince there was but one woman, &amp; one childe? whereunto the <hi>Indian</hi> aunſwered. In this <hi>India</hi> they do not conſent that the nources ſhould ſlepe togethers in one bedde with the younge childe, whome they nouriſhe: for when the women are heauy a ſleape, not taking heade to the child, they many times ouerlay the poore infante, and ſo ſmother it aliue.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly the philoſopher aſked why ioyning to the beddes, there was net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels which are without ſauour in eating, and daungerous in touching? The <hi>Indian</hi> aunſwered. I let thee knowe, that in this <hi>India</hi> (againſt all nature) the children wepe not whyles they are younge, and therefore they haue grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the beddes nettelles to make them weape: for our philoſophers tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that if dayly the childe doth weape twoo houres, it profiteth hym not onely for the health of his body, but alſo for to prolonge his lyfe.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore the philoſopher for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſixt aſked, why ther was ſo many twigs
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:21411:148"/>
like Roſemary by the bed ſide? whereunto the <hi>Indian</hi> aunſwered. Knowe thou, that in <hi>India</hi> there is an olde plague, that we can not defend our ſelues from theſe witcheis, the whiche by their ſorceries, and with the only lookes of their eyes deſtroyeth many chyldren: and they ſaye, that all the children whiche ſhalbe perfumed with thoſe herbes, can take no hurte through the lookes of thoſe witcheis.</p>

                        <p>Since the daye that thou diddeſt take ſhippinge at the hauen of <hi>Oſtia,</hi> I read no letter of thine, neither haue I ſene as yet any man of thy houſe: yea and more ouer they coulde not tell me, whether thou were alyue or dead. Wherfore thy frendes did imagine that ſome miſhappe befel to thee, and thy ſhippe, or els for the miſliking of the countrey, thou ſhouldeſt returne againe. Becauſe that men, whiche doe ſayle (as thou) goe alwayes in daunger to be drowned by ſome tempeſt, &amp; if they do eſcape, they do diſpaire in the ſtraunge countrey by ſolitarines: but when I ſawe <hi>Fronton</hi> thy ſeruaunt, I was very ioyfull, and much more when I vnderſtode thou were aliue after thy great trauaile. Truly I receiued great pleaſure of that thou wryteſt in thy letter, that thou art contented with the countrey: for to me it is a ſtraunge thyng, that a man being nouriſhed in the deliciouſnes of Rome, ſhould finde hym ſelfe contented in an other ſtraunge Realme and nation. When Rome was Rome, and Italy was named great Grece, thither came of all ſortes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and nations, to learne vertues &amp; noblenes, and others for to geue them ſelues to vices and pleaſures. Becauſe (if <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> deceyue me not) Rome ſpent all her treaſures in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> employed all her vices and delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in Rome.

The noble and ſtoute perſonages, though they would be eſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and iudged true in their ſaiyng, hauinge ſeene many wounders with their eies: yet when they doe counte them, then they ought to be very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their tongues. For it is a ſhame to the honeſt man to declare a thing, wherein may be any doubte, whether it be true or not. I wyll briefly aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare all the thynges of thy lettre, and the aunſwere ſhalbe, not accordyng to thy deſyre: but according to that I perceaue of thee, and the worlde.</p>

                        <p>Thou ſayeſt that in the Sea thou haſte paſte many daungers, and that for to lighten the ſhippe, thou diddeſt caſte muche of thy goodes into the Sea.

For they whiche ſayle the Seas ought not to regarde the goodes they looſe, but the life whiche they ſaue.</p>
                        <p>Thou ſayeſt, that in the Sea thou were greatly accompaignied with paſſingyers, and that thou haſt taried lenger in thy viage then thou though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, or diddeſt deſire. This I ſaye vnto thee, my frende <hi>Dedalus,</hi> that though the dayes were many thou diddeſt ſtaye: yet notwithſtandinge the griefes were more which thou receiuedſt. For it is vnpoſſible that thoſe men which ſayle muche, ſhould not be troubled with the mariners, and alſo in feare of tempeſtes.</p>
                        <p>To that I aunſwere thee, thee the more thou were loden with compaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the leſſe thy money weyed: for it is a generall rule, that where the iorney is longe, and the company great, there the purce of neceſſitie muſte nedes ware thynne.</p>

                        <p>To that I aunſwere, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayeth, that in the countrey where there is many Phiſitians, there are many vyces, and many vitious: For man by exceſſiue delicatenes commeth to ſicknes, and by the meane trauayle he is healed. As long as oure auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fathers were without Phiſitians in Rome, which was foure hundred yeares: ſo longe and no more they ſhewed them ſelues ſober in eating and drynkinge. For euen as by temperaunce, healthe

proceadeth: ſo of phiſicke, proceadeth glotony. Thou ſayeſt, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is very fertile, and that amongeſt other thinges there is much woode whiche we lacke here in Rome. To this I aunſwere, that if thou haſte much wood, thou haſt litle bread: For it is an auncient prouerbe, that wher the fiers are great, the barnes are fewe. And if thou ſaieſt, that thou art con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the woode of that countrey: I let the knowe that I am not diſcon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tented with the bread of Italy. For in the end, a man ſhall ſoner finde wood to heate the ouen: then corne to cary to the mille. Truly it is a good thing to haue woode for the Wynter: but it is better to haue corne for the Wynter, and Sommer. For they call it no honger, when woode lacked for the aged: but when bread wanteth for the younge.</p>
                        <p>Thou ſaieſt in that countrey there are many waters, and that the water is very cleare and colde: and furder that the aboundaunce thereof is ſuche, that euery houſe hath a fountaine. To this I aunſwere thee, that where the waters doe abounde, there wanteth healthe continually. And I doe not marueile thereat, for the moiſte and dankyſhe places are alwayes daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, vnhealthfull, and noyſome. If this had bene in the tyme of the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den worlde, when men knewe not what wyne mente, but that all dranke water: without compariſon that countrey had bene better then this. For the more the dronkennes of wyne is infamous: the more ſweter and profitable is that of the water.</p>
                        <p>Thou knoweſt well, that a Fountaine whiche I haue in my gardein (by the ſtreate <hi>Salaria</hi>) was occaſion that at one tyme ſeuen of my houſe died to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gethers. And if I had not made a conduite to voyde the ſtanding water: I thinke it had made an ende of me, and of all my familie. Wherefore I praye thee haue reſpecte vnto the health of thy perſonne, rather then to enioye the freſhenes of the water. For my parte I thinke him onely happy, who hath his body healthfull, and his harte at eaſe. Prayſe as muche the lande as they wyll, enioye thou the freſhenes thereof as muche as thou canſt, and fill thee with the freſhe and colde water, and wryte vnto thy frendes how plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it is, in the ende I ſweare vnto thee my frende <hi>Dedalus,</hi> that more money ſhall iſſue out of Rome, to vie wyne in <hi>Candia:</hi> then buttes of the colde wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of that countrey ſhall enter into Rome.</p>
                        <p>Thou ſayeſt that in that countrey there is ſuche aboundaunce of fruites, that thou thinkeſt thou ſhalt neuer be ſatiſfied therewith. To that I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare. That thing whiche I beſt lyke, is a wynter fruite: yet neither ſeing it, nor eating it, I can content my ſelfe. For the countrey where fruites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounde in wynter, is neuer without feuers and ſickneſſes in Sommer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Octauian Auguſtus</hi> the famous Emperour of memorie, ſeinge that Rome in Sommer was very ſubiect to diſeaſes, commaunded on greuous paines, that the fruites of <hi>Salon</hi> ſhould not enter into Rome to be ſolde. And this is a marueilous thinge, that Rome by this meanes dyd not onely fynde her ſelfe hole: but alſo the Phiſitians went out of Rome of their owne wylles and affections. For it is a greate token that the people is healthfull, when the Phiſitions are poore. Thou ſaieſt in that countrey there are many Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers and Players. To this I aunſwere thee. That their paſtimes ſhal not be vnto thee ſuche, and ſo pleaſaunte: as the griefes and diſpleaſures thou
<pb facs="tcp:21411:150"/>
ſhalt haue, when they craftely ſhall picke thy pourſe. For Iuglers and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers make playes and ſporte in ieſte: but they wyll be payed in good earneſt.</p>
                        <p>Thou ſaieſt in that countrey there is great aboundaunce of vynes, and that the wyne is ſauoury to ſmell, and very ſwete and pleaſaunt to taſte: whereunto I anſwere. That there ſhal not be ſo many vynes in the fieldes, as dronkardes amongeſt the people: for as thou knoweſt, the daye that I maried <hi>Topina</hi> my niece, my vncle <hi>Getellius</hi> had but onely one vyne tree, and yet with the wyne that came thereof, he made him ſelfe, his houſhold, and al thoſe that were at the mariage dronke. That which I wyl ſay is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weeping, (in the olde time) <hi>Mars</hi> was the God moſt honoured and eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, beinge the God of battailes: but nowe <hi>Bachus,</hi> whiche is God of wyne, is moſte honoured, ſerued, and exalted.</p>
                        <p>For the time that a Roman was wont to employ in the marſhal campe, to handle weapons: nowe they conſume in playing, and drinking in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes. <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> in his <hi>Annales</hi> ſaith, that thoſe of <hi>Gallia Tranſalpina,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Italians had planted vines, came to conquere the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. So that if they had neuer planted vynes in Italy, the Frenche menne had neuer deſtroyed the countrey.</p>
                        <p>The auncient Romaines (whiche were prouided againſt all inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that wyne was the cauſe of their deſtruction, commaunded to deſtroy al the vynes of the Empire, through the which pollicie they were deliuered from all the Frenche men: for when the warres were ended, there remained not one Frenche man in all Italy, when they knewe that there were no more vynes therein. Thou ſaieſt that in that countrey there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gentlemen, and honourable Senatours, with whom thou talkeſt, and paſſeſt away the time. To this I aunſwere, that if it be true, there are many idle men, and alſo fewe true talkers: for thoſe men whiche haue ſpente their youth in the warres, when they are aged, do not employ the time but in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring newes, and telling lyes. Thou ſaideſt that there are very faire women in that countrey, of geſture ſemely, and of their perſonnes comly. To this I aunſwere. That if there be many which be faire, there are as many whiche are diſhoneſt: For if the woman with her beautie, hath not wiſedome and honeſtie in her ſelfe, ſhe putteth her ſelfe in peryl, &amp; her huſband in much care. Thou ſaieſt that in that countrey there are women which are Sooth ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Sorcerers, and Enchauntours: the which doe boaſte and vaunte them ſelues that they wil heale infantes, &amp; that they can weyne them better then others. To this I aunſwere. That I would iudge it muche better, that children ſhould neuer be healed, then that they ſhould be healed by the hands of ſo euill women. For the profitte that they doe by their experience openly, is nothing in reſpect of the daunger wherein they put the creatures by their ſorceries ſecretly. <hi>Torquatus Laertius</hi> my vncle, had a doughter of a maruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous beautie, the whiche (becauſe he had none other chylde) was heyre of all his patrimonie. The caſe therefore was ſuche, that as the doughter wepte one daye a lytle to muche, the nource whiche gaue her ſucke, to appeaſe and ſtylle her, thynkynge to geue her ſorceries to caſte her in a ſleape, gaue her poyſon to deſtroye her: ſo that when the teares of the innocent babe ceaſed, then the cryes of the wofull mother beganne.</p>

Thy ſeruaunt <hi>Fronton</hi> hath told me newes that thou haſt a ſonne borne, wherof I am very glad: and moreouer he ſayd, that a woman of <hi>Sannia</hi> did noriſhe it, and gaue it ſucke. The which (as by an euyl chaunce) hath a ſpice of ſorcerye. By the immortal gods I do coniure the, and for the loue I beare the I deſire the, that immediatly thou put her out of thy houſe, &amp; ſuffer not ſo wicked a woman to eate bread ther one day: for euery creature which is nouriſhed by ſorceries and charmes, ſhal eyther haue his life ſhort, or els fortune ſhalbe contrarie vnto him.

For my part I take it to be a thing to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the men which by the wil of god fal ſicke, ſhal neuer heale for any dyligence that man can do. And wher as children are ſicke by euil humors, or that they are not very healthful, becauſe the gods wil take lyfe from them: in this caſe, if their diſeaſe proceade of an euil humour, let them aſke phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for natural medecins.

For in the end it is vnpoſſible that the diſſeaſes of the hart ſhould be healed, by the meanes of any medycins of the body. Do not marueile my frende <hi>Dedalus,</hi> if I haue ſpoken more in this article then in others, that is to wete, to perſwade the ſo much to kepe thy children from wytches: for otherwiſe the curſed women wil do them more harme, then the good mylke ſhal profite them.

                     <p>ONe of the chefeſt things that the creatour gaue to man, was to know &amp; be able to ſpeake: for otherwiſe (the ſoule reſerued) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brute beaſtes are of more value, then do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me men. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his <hi>Aeconomices,</hi> without com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pariſon prayſeth more the <hi>Pithagoricall</hi> ſort, then the <hi>Stoical:</hi> ſayeng that the one is more conforme to reaſon, then the other is. <hi>Pithagoras</hi> commaunded, that all men which were domme, and without ſpeache, ſhould imediately, &amp; without contradiction be baniſhed and expulſed from the people. The cauſe why this phyloſopher had commaunded ſuch thing was, forſomuche as he ſayd, that the tongue is moued by the mocions of the ſoule, &amp; that he whiche had no tongue had no ſoule. And he which hath no ſoule, is but a brute beaſt: and he that is a beaſt, deſerueth to ſerue in the fields among brute beaſts. It is a good thing not to be domme as bruyte beaſtes are: and it is a greater thing to ſpeake as the reaſonable men do: but it is muche more worthye to ſpeake wel, as the eloquent philoſophers do. For otherwiſe if he which ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth doth not wey the ſentences more then the wordes, ofte tymes the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingayes ſhal content them more which are in the cage: then the men which do read in ſcooles. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in the booke <hi>De bello Iudaico</hi> ſaith, that king <hi>Herode,</hi> not onely with his perſonne and goodes, but alſo with all his frendes and parentes folowed and gaue ayde to <hi>Marcus Anthonius,</hi> and to his louer <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opatra,</hi> howbeit in the end <hi>Octauian</hi> had the vyctorie. For the man which for the loue of a woman doth enterpriſe conqueſtes, it is impoſſible that eyther he looſe not his lyfe, or els that he lyue not in infamy <hi>Herode</hi> ſeing that <hi>Marcus Anthonius</hi> was dead, determyned to go towardes the Emperour <hi>Octauian,</hi> at whoſe feete he layd his crowne, and made a notable oration, wherein he ſpake ſo pleaſaunt wordes, and ſo hyghe ſentences, that the Emperour <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian</hi> did not only pardon him for that he was ſo cruell an enemye: but alſo
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:21411:151"/>
he confirmed him againe into his Realme, and toke him for his deare and ſpecial frend. For among the good men and noble hartes, many euil workes are amended by a few good words. If <hi>Blundus,</hi> in the booke intituled <hi>Roma triumphante,</hi> do not deceiue me, <hi>Pirrus</hi> the great king of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> was ſtout and hardy, valiaunt in armes, liberal in benefites, pacient in aduerſityes and aboue al renowmed to be very ſwete in wordes, and ſage in his aunſwers.</p>
                     <p>They ſayd that this <hi>Pirrus</hi> was ſo eloquent, that the man with whom once he had ſpoken remayned ſo much his, that from that time foreward in his abſence he toke his part, and declared his life and ſtate in preſence. The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue named <hi>Blundus</hi> ſaied and <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> declareth the ſame, that as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maynes were of al things prouided (ſeing that king <hi>Pirrus</hi> was ſo eloquent) they prouided in the ſenate, that no Romaine Embaſſadour ſhold ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but by a third perſon: for otherwiſe he would haue perſwaded them through his ſweate woordes, that they ſhoulde haue retourned againe to Rome as his procurers &amp; Soliciters. Albeit <hi>Marcus Tullius Cicero</hi> was Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour in the Senate, conſul in the Empire, rich amongeſt the rich, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy amongeſt men of warre: yet truly none of theſe qualyties cauſed him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal memorie, but only his excellent eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. This <hi>Tullius</hi> was ſo eſtemed in Rome for the eloquence of his tongue only that oft times they hard hym talke in the Senate iii. houres togethers, without any man ſpeakinge one word. And let not this be lytle eſtemed nor lightly paſſed ouer: for worldlye malyce is of ſuch condicion, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome man may more eaſely ſpeake 4. howers, then another man ſhal haue pacience to heare him one minute, <hi>Anthonius Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellicus</hi> declareth, that in the time of <hi>Amilcares</hi> the <hi>Affricans,</hi> a Philoſopher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Afronio</hi> floriſhed in great <hi>Carthage,</hi> who being of the yeres of 81. dyed in the firſt yeare of the warres of <hi>Punica.</hi> They demaunded this Phyloſopher, what it was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knew? he aunſwered. He knew nothing but to ſpeake wel. They demaunded him againe what he learned? he aunſwered. He did learne nothinge but to ſpeake wel. Another time they demaunded him what he taught? he aunſwered. He taught nothing but to ſpeake wel. Me thinketh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this good phyloſopher in 80. yeres and one, ſaid that he learned nothing but to ſpeake wel, he knew nothing but to ſpeake wel, &amp; that he taught nothing but to ſpeake wel. And truly he had reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for the thing which moſt adorneth mans life, is the ſweate pleaſaunte tongue to ſpeake wel. What is it to ſee ii. men in one councel, the one talking to the other, the one of them hath an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll grace in propounding, and thother excellent in ſpeaking. Of ſuch there are ſome, that in hearing theym talke .iii. houres, we would neither be tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled nor weryed: and of the contrarie part there are others ſo tedyous, and rude in their ſpeache that as ſone as men perceiue they beginne to ſpeake they auoyde the place. And therfore in mine opinyon ther is no greater trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thenne to herken one quarter of an houre a rude man to ſpeake: and to be contrarye ther is no greater pleaſure, thenne to heare a dyſcreate man though it were a whole weke.</p>
                     <p>The deuyne <hi>Plato</hi> in the Booke of Lawes ſayd, that there is nothynge whereby a manne is knowen more, thenne by the woordes he ſpeaketh: for of the woordes whyche we heare hym ſpeake, we iudge his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eyther to be good or euil. <hi>Laertius</hi> in the lyfe of the Phyloſophers ſayeth,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:152"/>
that a yong child borne at <hi>Athens,</hi> was brought vnto <hi>Socrates</hi> the great phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher: being in <hi>Athens,</hi> to the end he ſhold receiue him into his company, &amp; teach him in his ſcoole. The yong chyld was ſtraunge and ſhamefaſte, and durſt not ſpeake before his maiſter: wherfore the philoſopher <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſpeake frend, if thou wilt that I know the. This ſentence of <hi>Socrates</hi> was very profound: and I pray him that ſhal reade this wryting, to pauſe a while therat. For <hi>Socrates</hi> wil not that a man be knowen by the geſture he hath, but by the good or euyl wordes which he ſpeaketh. Though eloquence and ſpeaking wel, to euery man is a cauſe of augmenting their honour, and no dimyniſſher of their goodes: yet withoute compariſon it ſhineth muche more, and is moſt neceſſarie in the pallaces of Prynces and great Lordes. For men which haue common offices, ought of neceſſity harken to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall contrymen, &amp; alſo to ſpeake with ſtraungers. Speking therfore more plainly I ſay, that the Prince ought not to trauaile only to haue eloquence, for the honour of his perſon: but alſo it behoueth him for the comon wealth.</p>
                     <p>For as the prince is but one, and is ſerued of all: ſo it is vnpoſſible that he haue ſo much, as wil ſatiſfye and content them al. And therfore it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that he requyte ſome mith money: &amp; that he content others with good wordes. For the noble hart loueth better a gentle worde: then a reward or gift, with the tongue of a rude man. <hi>Plato. Liuius, Herodotus, Vulpicius, Eutropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Diorus. Plynie,</hi> and many other innumerable auncient hiſtoryographers, do not ceaſe to prayſe the eloquence of greeke princes, and latynes, in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. O how bleſſed were thoſe tymes, when ther were ſage princes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete lords: truly they haue reaſon to exalt them. For many haue obteyned, and wonne the royal crounes and ſeptures of the Empire, not ſo much for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great battailes they haue conquered, nor for the highe bloud and generacion from whence they are dyſſended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for the wiſedom, and eloquence, which they had. <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was natural of Rome borne in mount <hi>Celio,</hi> he was poore in patrimony, and of baſe lynage, lytel in fauour, lefte and forſaken of his parentes, and beſides al this, only for beinge vertuous in his lyfe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found in doctrine, and of ſo high eloquence, the Emperour <hi>Anthonius</hi> (called <hi>Pius</hi>) gaue him his daughter <hi>Fauſtine</hi> for wife: who being reproued of many, bycauſe he gaue his doughter to ſo poore a philoſopher, aunſwered.

                        <hi>Pulio</hi> in his ſeuenth booke of the Romaine lawes ſayth, that in Rome ther was a law very wel kept, &amp; obſerued of the conſulles, by a cuſtome brought in, that the Dictatours, Cenſors, and Emperours of Rome, entered into the Senate once in the weke at the leaſt, and in this place they, ſhould geue and render accompt, in what ſtate the common wealth remayned. O, would to God that at this preſent this law were ſo kept, and obſerued: for ther is none who doth miniſter ſo good iuſtice, as he which thinketh to giue accompt of his doings. They ſay that <hi>Calligula</hi> (the fourth Emperoure of Rome) was not only deformed, infamous, and cruel in his lyfe: but alſo was an Idiote in eloquence, and of an euyl vtteraunce in his communycacion. So that he among al the Romaine princes, was conſtrayned to haue others to ſpeake for him in the Senate. This wickedman was ſo vnfortunate, that after his cruel and infamous death, they drew him throughout Rome, and ſet vppon

                     <p>I Cannot tel why princes do prayſe them ſelues to be ſtrong and hardy, to be wel diſpoſed, to be runners, to iuſt wel, and do not eſteame to be elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſinſe it is true that thoſe giftes do profite them only for their life, but the eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce profiteth them, not only for to honour their life, but alſo to aug<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment their renowme. For we do reade, that by that many Princes dyd pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifye great ſedycions in the common wealth, and beſides that they deſerued immortall memorie. <hi>Suetonius Trancquillus</hi> in the firſte booke of <hi>Ceſars</hi> ſayth, that the aduenturous <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> (being as yet but 16. yeares of age) when there dyed in Rome an aunt of his called <hi>Cornelia,</hi> at her buriall he made an oracion, in the which he (being ſo yong) ſhewed marueilous great eloquence: which was ſo accepted that day in al people, that in the end, euery man iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to be a valiaunt Romane captaine. And as <hi>Appianus</hi> declareth, they ſay that <hi>Silla</hi> ſpake theſe wordes. That which I perceiue of this yong man <hi>Caius Ceſar</hi> is, that in the boldnes of his tongue, he declareth how valiaunt he ought to be in his perſon. Let therfore Princes and great Lords ſe, how much it may profite them, to know to ſpeake wel and eloquently. For we ſe no other thing dayly, but that a man of baſe lynage, by his eloquence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be exalted: and the other which of lynage is nobly borne, for wante of ſpeaking wel, and being eloquent, is the firſt that diſcendeth moſt vileſt of al other. Thentencion wherupon I wrate theſe things was for no other, but to admoniſhe, perſwade, and pray al princes, and great lordes, that whiles their children are yong, they ſhould put them to wiſe and learned men, to the end they ſhould teache them: not only how they ought to liue, but alſo how they ought to ſpeake. For to perſonnes of eſtate it is a great infamy, to do, or to inuent to do a thing, and afterward not to know how to geue a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon therof, <hi>Polidorus</hi> in the third booke of his commentaries ſayth, that when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were put to flyght by the <hi>Athenians</hi> in <hi>Rota Millina</hi> (it is cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led <hi>Millina,</hi> bycauſe the battaile was in the riuer of <hi>Milline</hi>) the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſent a phyloſopher called <hi>Heuxinus,</hi> to treate of peace with the <hi>Athenians:</hi> who made ſuch an eloquent oracion to the Senate of <hi>Athens,</hi> that hee dyd not only obtaine the peace which he deſired for his country, but for himſelfe alſo he wanne perpetual renowme.

For in the end, the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and inconueniences of the cruel warres are ſo great, that the euill and daunger is certeine to them that are vanquiſhed: and the profite is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to them that haue ouercommed. We would gladly, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which now ye wil, ye would haue willed ſoner: &amp; that which now ye require &amp; demaund, that before ye had requyred, and demaunded. But what ſhal we do, ſinſe it was ordeined to your and our woful deſtenies, that he ſhould looſe the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, and that we of your loſſe can take no profite. For it is a rule vnfallible, that al that which the gods haue ordeyned, no worldly wight can amende, nor humaine power reſiſt. Ye demaund that warre may ceaſe and leaue of, and that we take truiſe for .iii. monethes, and that during this time, peace &amp; concord may be concluded. To this we make aunſwere. That the ſenate of <hi>Athens</hi> hath not accuſtomed to graunt peace, afterwards for to retourne to warre. For amongeſt vs <hi>Athenians</hi> we haue an auncient law, that freely we do accept the cruel warre, and liberallye we doe graunt perpetual peace. In our ſcoles and vniuerſities we trauaile to haue Sages in time of peace, for to helpe vs with their counſayles in the time of warre. And they do coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile vs that we neuer take vpon vs truſe, vpon ſuſpect condicion. And in dead they counſaile vs well. For the fayned and dyſſembled peace is muche more perrillous: then is the manifeſt warre. The philoſopher <hi>Heuxinus</hi> your embaſſadour, hath ſpoken to vs ſo highly, and eloquentlye in this Senate, that it ſemed to vs very vniuſt, if we ſhould deny him, and gaine ſay that he requireth vs. For it is much more honeſtye to graunt him peace, whiche by ſweete and pleaſaunt words doth demaund it: then him which by force and ſharpe ſword doeth requyreth it. Let the caſe therfore be, that the Senate, people, and Sages of <hi>Athens</hi> haue ordeyned, that warre do ceaſe with the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and that al diſcordes, contencions, diſſentions, and debates do end, &amp; that perpetual peace be graunted vnto them.

                     <p>Wherfore by this letter we declare vnto you, and by the immortal Gods we ſweare, that we do renownce vnto you al our right, on ſuch condicion, that you do leaue vs <hi>Heuxinus</hi> your embaſſadour &amp; philoſopher. The great <hi>Athens</hi> deſyreth rather a phyloſopher for her ſcholes: then a hole prouince of your realmes. And do not you other <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> thinke, that that which we of <hi>Athens</hi> do, is light or fooliſhe, that is to wete, that we deſire rather one man to rule: then to haue a whole prouynce whereby we may commaunde many.

Thinke not ye <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that without a cauſe we do perſwade you, that you put youre children to learne, when as yet they are but yong and tender, and that ye do not ſuffer them to ronne to vyces?

                     <p>THE pilgrimes which trauaile through vnknowen contries, &amp; ſtraung mountaynes (with great deſire to go forward, and not to erre) do not only aſke the way which they haue to go: but alſo do importune thoſe whom they mete, to point them the way with theyr finger. For it is a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous thing, to trauaile doubtfully in feare and ſuſpicion. By this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I meane, that ſince I haue much perſwaded, that the fathers do learne &amp; teach their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake wel, it is but reaſon that they do ſeke them ſome good maiſters. For the counſaile hath no authoritie, if he which geueth it, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not ſpedely to execute the ſame. It is much for a man to be of a good nature, or els to be of an euil inclinacion, to be rude in vnderſtanding, or els to be lyuely in ſpirite: and this not only for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man ought to do, but alſo for that he ought to ſay, For it is no ſmal thing, but a great good benefite whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the man is of a good nature, of a good vnderſtanding, and of a cleare iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. This notwithſtandyng I ſay, that al the good and cleare iudgements, are not alwayes eloquent, nor al the eloquenteſt, of liuely ſpirites, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. We ſe many men which of a ſmal mater, can make much: &amp; for the contrary we ſe many men, which haue great knowledge, &amp; yet no meanes to vtter it. So that nature hath geuen them highe vnderſtanding, &amp; through negligence of bringinge vp it is hidde, Oftentimes I do meruaile that the ſoule of the babe when it is borne, for thone parte is of no leſſe excellencye: then the ſoule of the old man when he dyeth. And on the other ſide I muſe at the babe which hath the members ſo tender (wherwith the ſoule dooth worke his operacyons) that they lytle ſeme to participate with reaſonable creatures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:154"/>For wher the ſoule doth not ſhew her ſelfe miſtres, it wanteth lytle but that the man remaineth a beaſt.</p>
                     <p>It is a wonder to ſe the children, that as yet beinge .ii. yeares of age, they lyft their feete for to go, they hold themſelues by the walles for faulyng, they wil open their eyes to know, and they fourme a defuſed voice to ſpeake: ſo that in that age, a creature is none otherwiſe, then a tre at the firſt ſpring.</p>
                     <p>For the tree .ii. moneths being paſt, beareth leaues immediatly: and the child after ii. yeres beginneth to frame his words. This thing is ſpoken, for that the Fathers which are wiſe, ſhould beginne to teache their children at that age: For at that time the vynes beare grapes, and other trees their fruite.</p>
                     <p>For the perilles of this lyfe are ſuch, that if it were poſſible, the father before he ſee his ſonne borne, ought to admoniſhe them how he ſhold liue. In mine opinion, as they conuey the water about to turne the mille: ſo from the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der youth of the infant, they ought to ſhew and teach him to be eloquent, &amp; affable. For truly the child learneth diſtinctly to pronounce his words, when he doth ſucke the milke of his nource. We cannot deny, but that the children being but ii. or iii. yeres old, it is to ſone to giue them maiſters, or correcters. For at that age a nourſe to make them cleane is more neceſſarie: then a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for to correct their ſpeache. On the one part the children are very tender for to learne to ſpeake wel: and on the other part it is neceſſarie, that when they are very yong and lytle, they ſhold be taught and learned. I am of that opinion, that princeſſes and great Ladyes ſhould take ſuch nources to giue their children ſucke: that they ſhould be ſound to giue them their milke, and ſage for to teache them to ſpeake. For in ſo yong and tender age they do not ſuffer, but that ſhe which giueth them ſucke, doth teache them to ſpeake the firſte wordes. As <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> in the Booke of the diuerſityes of the Languages ſaythe. The <hi>Toſcans</hi> were the firſte whiche called the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tongue of the contrey, the mother tongue (which is to ſay, the tongue of our mother) to the end we ſhold take it of the mother which bringeth vs forth: &amp; of the nource whiche giueth vs ſucke. And in this caſe we haue leſſe neade of the mother, then of the nourſe. For the children before they knowe their mothers, which brought them into the world, do cal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nourſe mother which gaue them ſucke. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the ſecond booke of the regiment of prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces ſaith, that one of the greateſt thinges the Romaynes had in their comon weale was, that of al the languages &amp; maners which they ſpake through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the hole earth, they had Collegies and Scholes in Rome: ſo that were he neuer ſo Barbarous that entred into Rome, immedyatly he founde that vnderſtoode him.</p>
                     <p>The Romaynes vſed that craft and ſubtiltie, to the end that when Rome ſent Embaſſages into ſtraunge countries or that ſome ſtraunge countries came to Rome, they would that the interpretours and brokers ſhould be of theyr owne nacion and not of a ſtraunge tongue or countrey.</p>
                     <p>And the Romaynes truly had reaſonne, for the affaires of greate impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, are oftentymes craftely compaſſed by a ſtraunge tongue.</p>
                     <p>A manne wil maruaile greately to reade, or heare this that I ſpeake, whyche is, that the women whyche nouriſhe the children of Prynces be eloquente.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:21411:154"/>And truly he that at this doth meruaile, hath ſene lytle, and read leſſe. For I cannot tel which was greater, the glory that the auncientes had to enioy ſo excellent women: or the infamy of them that are preſent, to ſuffer diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt harlottes. I wil not deny, when I drew neere this matter, that my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite weare not in great perplexitie. Firſt to ſe in this my wrytinge, of what women my penne ſhoulde write, that is to wete, the diſſolute vyces of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which I haue ſene: or els the proweſſes and vertues of women wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of I haue reade. Finally, I am determined to entreate of our graine, and corne, and to leaue the rotten ſtraw on the earth, as without profite. For the tongue which is noble, ought to publyſhe the goodnes of the good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt women, to the end that al know it: for the contrary the frailenes of the wicked ought to be diſſembled, and kept ſecret, to the end that no man folow it. Men which are ſage and noble, treating of women, are bounde to ſerue them, to vyſite them, to preſerue them, &amp; to defend them: but in no wiſe they haue licence to ſclaunder them. For the man which ſpeaketh of the fraylenes of women, is like vnto him that taketh a ſword to kil a flye. Therfore tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the matter, Princeſſes and great Ladyes ought not to ceaſe to teache their yong children al that they can, ſonnes or doughters. And they oughte not to deceiue them ſelues, ſaying that foraſmuch as their doughters are wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men, they are vnable to learne ſciences. For it is not a general rule, that al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> children are of cleane vnderſtanding: nor that al the doughters are of rude ſpirite and witte. For if they and the others did learne togethers, I thinke there would be as many wiſe women, as there are fooliſhe men. Thoughe the world in times paſt did enioy excellent women, ther was neuer any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion had ſuch as the Grekes had. For though the Romaynes were glorious in weapons: the Grekes were of immortal memorie of letters. I wil not denay that in the common wealth of Rome, ther hath not bene nouriſhed, &amp; taught manye women of greate ſcyence: but that the difference of the one and the others was, that the Grecian women were learned in Philoſophy, and the Romaine women in Rethoricke and Poetrie. And hereof came that in <hi>Athens</hi> they eſteamed to know howe to teache well: and in Rome they vaunted how to ſpeake wel. <hi>Euphronius</hi> in the thirde booke of the Romaine geſtes ſayth, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third yere of the Conſulſhipe of <hi>Lelius Sylla,</hi> by chaunce a Greke Embaſſadour and an embaſſadour of Rome, were at words in the Senate of the Rhodians, and the Greke Embaſſadour ſayd to the Romaine Embaſſadour. It is true that amongeſt ye other Romaynes, ye are aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous in armes: but for al that, ye are vnable in ſcyences. For truly the wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men of Grece know more in letters: then the men of Rome in weapons.</p>
                     <p>As ſone as the Senate of Rome vnderſtode theſe words, immediatlye hereupon grew the cruel warres betwene Rome and <hi>Carthage,</hi> about the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of <hi>Scicil.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And no man ought hereat to meruaile, for in the end we ſe moe warres aryſe by iniurious wordes: then for to recouer the good that is loſt. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes and the Grecians therfore being ready the one to defye the other, the Rhodians came in the myddeſt, and kept them from ſuch debate, and in the end appointed them in this ſort.</p>
                     <p>That is to wete, that as this iniurye ſhould by weapons haue bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:155"/>
they ordeyned that by the diſputacions of women it ſhoulde be argued. And truly the Romaines were counſayled well, for it was greater ſhame to the Greekes to be ouercome with the tongues of women: then with the ſwordes of men. The caſe therof was ſuch, that by appointmente aſſembled at Rhodes tenne Romaine women, and tenne Greke women. All women very wel learned, the which in their chayres reade certaine leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, euery one after other, and afterwardes the one diſputed againſte the other, of ſundry and diuers maters. And finally, there was betwene theym great difference, for the Grekes ſpake very high thinges, not ſo profounde, but with an excellent ſtyle. We ought not to marueile that ſuch giftes were in thoſe women. For we dayly ſe it by experience, that profound ſcience, and high eloquence, ſeldome meeteth in one perſonage. The Grekes were verye wel pleaſed, to heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaine women: &amp; the Romaines remained aſtonied to heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Grekes. And vpon this occaſion y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Rhodians iudged in this ſort, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery one of them ſhould be crowned with a crowne of Laurel as vanquiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhers. And they iudged, that in graue ſentences the Grecians had the beſt: and in eloquent ſpeache the Romaines had the victorie. As the aboue named <hi>Euphronius</hi> ſaythe, theſe diſputacions being ended, the Romaine women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Rome: and the Greke women to Grece, wher they were receyued with ſuch triumphe and glorie, as if they had wonne a battaile. The ſenate of the Rhodians for the memorye of thoſe women (in the place of the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions) cauſed to be ſet vp twenty mighty pyllers, in euery one of the which were the names of the women. Which was ſo ſumptuous a building, that in Rhodes there were none vnto it, ſaue only the great Collyſeo. Thoſe pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers ſtoode vntil the time of <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> Emperour, who was ſo euyll that he inuented new vyces, and deſtroyed the auncient memories. The writers which wrote in that time, declare yet an other thing, wherin the women of Grece were differente from the women of Rome. That is to wete, that the Greke women were found more fayrer, then the Romaine women: but the Romaines had a better grace, and more riche in apparel, then the Grekes. They ſayd alſo that the Grekes were more hardy &amp; ſtout, then the Romay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: but the Romaynes were more honeſt, pleaſaunt, and gracious, then the Grekes. And if this be true, I do counſayle princeſſes and great Ladyes, that they haue no more enuye at the honeſty of the Matrones of Rome: then at the boldneſſe of the ladyes of Grecia. For women were not borne to ſley men in the warre: but to ſpinne, ſow, and liue wel like good houſewiues in the houſe.</p>

preſent to haue, to folow the auncient women in deuout liuing. For ther is no good thinge in the world at this preſent daye, but the like hath bene ſene of our auncients heretofore. When any ſodaine new &amp; vnacuſtomed thing doth happen, men that neuer ſaw the like, vſe to ſay that there was neuer the lyke in the world, yet in dede they ſay not true: For though the thinge be vnto them new, it is through their ignoraunce and ſimplenes whiche ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue reade it by them ſelues, nor heard it of others. For this excellencye hath the man that is learned: that for what ſo euer he heareth or ſayth, he is nothing abaſhed at. Since women now a dayes are ſo ignoraunt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any of them can reade wel, he that ſhal reade this wil maruaile why I do perſwade them to learne. But the truth knowen what the auncients were, and what they did know: from this time forwarde I beleue they woulde greatly reproue the women of this preſent. For the time which the auncient women ſpent in vertues and ſtudies: theſe of this preſent, conſume in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and vyces. <hi>Boccace</hi> in the boke of the praiſe of women ſayth, that <hi>Lucyus Sylla</hi> was a great compagnion of <hi>Marius</hi> the Conſul, in the time of the warre of <hi>Iugurtha:</hi> and was no leſſe a frend of <hi>Caius Ceſar,</hi> in the time of the firſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warres.

For ſhe wrote ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny letters and Orations with her owne hand, which her Father <hi>Lucius Sylla</hi> afterwardes learned by hart: and as he was in dede quycke of ſprite, ſo he vſed to recyte them to the Senate alwaies for his purpoſe.</p>

The wiſedome of thoſe two women ought to be much, ſynce <hi>Plato</hi> without them woulde not vtter one word, vnleſſe they were preſent in his ſchole. For <hi>Plato</hi> eſteamed more the vnderſtandyng and memorye of thoſe two women alone: then he did the Phyloſophy of his other Scollers together. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> the philoſopher was Scholler to <hi>Socrates,</hi> and of the moſte renowmed of <hi>Athens.</hi> He had a doughter called <hi>Aretha,</hi> the which was ſo wel learned in Greke and Latyn letters, that the common renowne ſaid, the ſoule of <hi>Socrates</hi> was entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aretha:</hi> and the cauſe that moued them to ſay this was, becauſe ſhe redde and declared the doctrine of <hi>Socrates</hi> in ſuch wiſe, that it ſeamed to moſt men ſhe had rather write by hand, then learne by ſtudy. <hi>Boccace</hi> in the ſecond boke of the praiſe of women ſayth, that this <hi>Aretha</hi> was ſo excellent a woman, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe did not only learne for her ſelfe, but alſo to teache others: &amp; did not only teache in diuers Scholes, but alſo ſhe wrote many and ſundry bookes, one ineſpecially in the prayſe of <hi>Socrates,</hi> an other of the maner of bringing vppe children, an other of the warres of <hi>Athens,</hi> an other of the tyrannical force, an other of the common wealth of <hi>Socrates,</hi> an other of the infelicities of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, an other of the Tyllage of the auncientes, an other of the wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders of mount <hi>Olympus,</hi> an other of the vaine care of the Sepulcre, an other of the prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the <hi>Antes,</hi> an other of the workmanſhippe of the Bees in honnye: and ſhe wrote two others the one of the vanities of youth, and the other of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of age.

                     <p>As <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> ſayeth, the ſectes of the philoſophers were more then .lxx. but in the ende they were reduced into ſeuen, and in the ende they were brought into thre ſects chiefly. That is to wete, Stoicques, Peripaeticques, and Pithagoricques. Of theſe pithagoricques, <hi>Pithagoras</hi> was the prince. <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zearcus, Annius Ruſticus</hi> and <hi>Laertius,</hi> with <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Boccace,</hi> all affirme one thinge, whereunto I did not greatly geue credite, which is: that this philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher <hi>Pithagoras</hi> had a ſiſter, not onely learned, but (if it be lawfull to ſpeake it) excellently learned. And they ſaye, that not ſhe of <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> but <hi>Pithagoras</hi> of her learned philoſophie. And of truthe it is a matter whereof I was ſo greatly abaſhed, that I can not tell who could be maiſter of ſuch a woman: ſince ſhe had <hi>Pithagoras</hi> the great philoſopher to her ſcholler. The name of the woman was <hi>Theoclea,</hi> to whom <hi>Pithagoras</hi> her brother, wrote &amp; ſent a letter, when he red philoſophie at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and ſhe at <hi>Samothracia</hi> doinge the like.

I haue red the booke whiche thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſende me, of fortune and miſfortune, from the beginning to the end: and nowe I knowe that thou art no leſſe graue in making, then gracious in teaching. The which doth not chaunce very oft to vs, which are men: and much leſſe (as we haue ſene) to you women. For the philoſopher <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> was rude in ſpeaking, &amp; profound in writing: &amp; <hi>Amenides</hi> was briefe in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and eloquent in ſpeaking. Thou haſt ſtudied and written in ſuch ſorte, that in the learning that thou ſheweſt, thou ſeameſt to haue read all the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers: and in the antiquities that thou doeſt declare, it ſemeth that thou haſt ſene all the time paſt. Wherein thou beinge a woman ſheweſt thy ſelfe more then a woman: becauſe the nature of women is, to caſte their eies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that that is preſent, and commonly to forget that that is paſt. They tell me that thou doeſt occupye thy ſelfe nowe in writing of our countrey. And truly in this caſe I can not ſay but that you haue matter enough to wryte on: For the warres and trauayles of our tymes haue bene ſuche, and ſo great, that I had rather reade them in bookes, then ſee them with my eyes. And if it be ſo, as I ſuppoſe it is, I beſeche thee hartely, and by the immortall

I meane, that thou doe not in this caſe bleamyſhe thy wryting, by putting therein any flatterie, or leſinge. For oftetimes Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers, in blaſinge more then trouth the giftes of their countrey: cauſe worthely to be ſuſpected their wryting. Thou knoweſt very well, how that in the battayle paſte the <hi>Rhodians</hi> were ouercome, and that ours remained victorious. Me thinketh thou ſhouldeſt not in this caſe greatly magnifie, extolle, or exalt ours, becauſe in the ende they fought to reuenge their iniury: neither thou oughteſt to blame the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> for they did not fight but in the ayde of Rome. I ſpeake this (my Syſter) becauſe for to defende their own, women ſhewe them ſelues Lyons: and for to defende the thinges of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, men ſhew them ſelues chickens. For in the ende he onely maye be counted ſtrong, the whiche defendeth not his owne houſe: but which dieth defending his, and another mans. I wyll not denie the naturall loue of my countrey, nor I wyll not denie but that I loue them that wryte, and ſpeake well thereof: but me thinketh it is not reaſon, that they ſhould diſprayſe the goodneſſe and truthe of other countries, nor that they ſhould ſo highly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the euill and vilenes of their owne. For there is not in the world this daye ſo barren a Realme, but maye be commended for ſome thing therein: nor there is ſo perfite a nation, but in ſome thinges maye be reproued. Thou canſt not deny me, but that amongeſt thy brethren I am the eldeſt, and thou canſte not deny but that amongeſt all thy diſciples I am the yongeſt: and ſince that for being thy diſciple I ought to obey thee, thou like wyſe for that I am thy eldeſt brother oughteſt to beleue me. By the fayeth of a people I doe councell thee, my ſyſter, that thou doe trauayle muche to be profound in thy words, vpright in thy life, and honeſt of thy perſone: and beſides al this, true in thy writing. For I let thee vnderſtande, that if the body of the man without the ſoule is litle regarded: I ſweare vnto thee that the mouthe of a man, without truthe, is muche leſſe eſteamed.</p>

                     <p>THis therefore was the letter, the whiche <hi>Pithagoras</hi> ſente to his ſyſter <hi>Theoclea,</hi> whereby is ſhewed the great humilitie of him, and the hyghe eloquence of her. <hi>Hiarcus</hi> the Greke, and <hi>Plutarche</hi> alſo in the booke of the gouernement of princes ſaye, that <hi>Pithagoras</hi> had not onely a ſiſter (whiche was called <hi>Theoclea</hi>) of whom he learned ſo muche philoſophie, but alſo he had a doughter, the wiſedome and knowledge of whome ſurmounted her aunte, and was equall to her father.

And it ought to be beleued: for the ſaying of the graue authours on the one parte: and by that we dayly ſee on the other parte. For in the ende, it is more pleaſure to heare a man tell mery tales, hauing grace and comlines in his wordes: then to heare a graue man ſpeake the truthe, with a rude and rough tongue.

telleth her name, ſaue only in a piſtle that <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tyraunt wrate, I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this word written, where he ſaith. <hi>Polichrata,</hi> that was the doughter of the philoſopher <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> was young, and exceading wyſe, more faire then riche and was ſo much honoured for the puritie of her life, and ſo high eſtemed for her pleaſaunt tongue: that the worde which ſhe ſpake ſpinning vpon her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaffe, was more eſtemed: then the philoſophy that her father red in the ſchole. And he ſayd more. It is ſo great a pitie to ſee, and heare that women at this preſent are in their life ſo diſhoneſt, &amp; in their tongues ſo malicious: that I haue greater pleaſure in the good renowme of one that is dead, then in the infamie of all them which are aliue. For a good woman is more worth with her diſtaffe ſpinning, then a hundred euel queenes, with their roiall ſcepters reigning. By the wordes which <hi>Phalaris</hi> ſaied in his letter, it ſeamed that this doughter of <hi>Pithagoras</hi> was called <hi>Polichrate. Pithagoras</hi> therefore made many commentaries, as wel of his owne countrey, as of ſtraungers. In the end he died in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> where at the houre of his death he ſpake vnto his doughter <hi>Polichrate,</hi> &amp; ſaied theſe wordes. I ſee my doughter that the houre wherein I muſt ende my life approcheth. The Gods gaue it me, and nowe they wil take it from me: nature gaue me birth, &amp; now ſhe geueth me death: the earth gaue me the body, and now it retourneth to aſhes. The woful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall deſtinies gaue me a litle goodes, mingled with manie trauailes, ſo that (doughter) of all thinges which I enioyed in this world, I cary none with me: for hauing all as I had it, by the waye of borowyng: nowe at my death eche man taketh his owne. I die ioyfully not for that I leaue thee riche: but for that I leaue thee learned. And in token of my tender harte, I bequethe vnto the al my bookes, wherin thou ſhalt finde the treaſure of my trauailes. And I tel thee that that I geue thee, is the riches gotten with mine owne ſweat: and not obtained to the preiudice of an other.

Theſe were the wordes which this philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſpake vnto his doughter lieng in his death bed. And though perhaps he ſpake not theſe wordes: yet at the leaſt this was the meaning. As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great poet <hi>Mantuan</hi> ſaieth, king <hi>Euander</hi> was father of the giant <hi>Pallas,</hi> and he was a great frende of king <hi>Eneas,</hi> he vaunted him ſelfe to diſcend of the linage of the Troyans: and therfore when king <hi>Eneas,</hi> &amp; prince <hi>Turnus,</hi> had great warres betwene them, which of them ſhould haue the princeſſe <hi>Lauinia</hi> in mariage, (the which at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time was only heire of Italy) king <hi>Euander</hi> ayded <hi>Eneas,</hi> not only with goodes: but alſo ſending him his owne ſonne in perſone.

This king <hi>Euander</hi> had a wyfe ſo well learned, that that which the Grekes ſaied of her ſemeth to be fables. That is to ſay (of her eloquence &amp; wiſdome) for they ſay, that if that which this woman wrote of the warres of Troye, had not bene through enuy caſt into the fire: the name of <hi>Homere</hi> had at this day remained obſcure.

Therefore the princeſſes and great Ladies ought to thinke that if they be women, they were alſo in lyke maner: and if they be frayle, the others were alſo weake. If they be maried, the other alſo had huſbandes: if they haue their wylles, the other had alſo what they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: if they be tender, the others were not ſtrong: Finally they ought not to excuſe them ſelues, ſaying that for to learne women are vnmete. For a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath more abilitie to learne ſciences in the ſcholes: then the Parate hath to ſpeake wordes in the cage. In my opinion princeſſes &amp; great ladies ought not to eſteame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues more then an other, for that they haue fairer heares then other, or for that they are better appareled then an other: or that they haue more ryches then an other. But they ought therfore to eſteame them ſelues, not for that they can doe more then others. To ſay the truth, the faire and yelow heares, the riche and braue apparel, the great treaſures, the ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous palaces and ſtrong buildinges, theſe and other like pleaſures are not guides and leaders to vertues, but rather ſpies &amp; ſcout watches for vices. O what a noble thinge were it, that the noble ladies would eſteme them ſelues not for that they can doe: but for that that they knowe. For it is more commendation to knowe howe to teache twoo philoſophers: then to haue authoritie to commaunde a hundred knightes. It is a ſhame to write it, but it is more pitie to ſee it, that is to wete, to read that we read of the wiſdome and worthines of the auncient matrones paſte, and to ſee as we doe ſee the frailenes of theſe younge ladies preſent. For they coueted to haue diſciples both learned and experimented: and theſe of this preſent deſire nothing but to haue ſeruauntes not only ignoraunt, but deceitful and wicked. And I do not marueile ſeing that which I ſe, that at this preſent in court ſhe is of litle value &amp; leſt eſtemed among ladies, which hath faireſt ſeruauntes, &amp; is leſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteined of gentlemen. What ſhall I ſay more in this matter but that they in times paſt ſtriue who ſhould write better, &amp; compile the beſt bookes: and theſe at this preſente doe not ſtriue, but who ſhal haue the richeſt and moſt ſumptuous apparel. For the ladies thinke it a iolier matter, to weare a gown of a new fachion: then the auncientes did to read a leſſon of philoſophie. The auncient ladies ſtriue whiche of them was wiſeſt: but theſe of our daies co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend who ſhalbe faireſt. For at this day y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ladies would choſe rather to haue the face adorned with beautie, then the heart endued with wiſedome. The auncient ladies contented which ſhould be better able to teache others: but theſe ladies nowe a daies contend how they may moſte finely apparel them ſelues. For in theſe daies they geue more honour to a woman richely appare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then they geue to an other with honeſtie beautified. Finally with this worde I doe conclude, and let him marke that ſhall reade it, that in the olde time women were ſuch, that their vertues cauſed al men to kepe ſilence: and now their vices be ſuch, that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pell al men to ſpeake. I will not by this my word any man ſhould be ſo bolde in generally to ſpeake euil of all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: for in this caſe I ſweare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are not at this day ſo many good ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous women in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world: but that I haue more enuy at the life they lead in

For Rome honored thoſe that were preſent in ſuch ſort, that it was without the preiudice of thoſe that are gone. Amongeſt thoſe .v. linages, the romaines alwayes counted the <hi>Cornelij</hi> moſt fortunat, the which were ſo hardy and couragious in fight, and ſo modeſt in lyfe, that of theyr familie there was neuer found any cowardly man in the feld, nor any defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med woman in the towne. They ſaye of this linage of the <hi>Cornelij,</hi> amonge many other there were .iiii. ſingular and notable women among the whiche the chiefe was the mother of <hi>Gracchi</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Cornelia</hi> and liued with more honour for the ſciences ſhe red in Rome, then for the conqueſtes that her children had in <hi>Affricke.</hi> Before her children wer brought into the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, they talked of none other thing but of their ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp; hardines, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the worlde: and therfore a Romaine one daye aſked this woman <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia,</hi> wherof ſhe toke moſt vaine glory, to ſe her ſelfe miſtres of ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, or mother of ſo valiant children.

                     <p>And ſhe ſayd further. I am aſſured that the diſciples dayly will waxe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better: and it maye bee that my Children wil waxe worſe and worſe.

Since you are yong, and not very ryche, ſince you are hardy, and brought vp in the trauailes of <hi>Afrike,</hi> I do not doubte but that you doe deſire to come to Rome, to ſe and know that now you are men, whiche you haue ſene when you were children. For men doe not loue their countrey ſo much, for that it is good: as they do loue it, for that it is naturall. Beleue me children, ther is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing that hath ſene or hard ſpeake of Rome in times paſt: but hath great griefe, ſorow, and pitie, to ſe it at this preſent. For as their hartes are pitiefull, and their eyes tender: ſo they can not behold that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great ſorow, which in times paſt they haue ſene in great glory. O my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, you ſhal know that Rome is greatly chaunged from that it was wont to be. To reade that that we do reade of it in times paſt, &amp; to ſe that whyche we ſe of it now preſent: we muſt nedes eſteme that whiche the auncientes haue writen as a geſt, or els beleue it but as a dreame. Ther is no other thing now at Rome, but to ſee iuſtice corrupted, the commen weale oppreſſed, lyes blowen abroade, the truth kept vnder, the ſatires ſilent, the flatterers open mouthed, the inflamed perſonnes to be Lordes, and the pacient to be ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, and aboue al, and worſe then all, to ſe the euil liue in reſt &amp; contented, and the good troubled &amp; diſpleaſed. Forſake, forſake (my children) that citie, where the good haue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to weape, &amp; the euil haue liberty to laugh. I can not tel what to ſay in this mater, as I would ſay. Truly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale is at this day ſuch &amp; ſo woful, that eche wiſe man (without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon) wold haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſure to be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres of <hi>Affrik:</hi> then in the peace at Rome.

Therefore my children, ſince you are naturall of Rome. I wil tel you what Rome is at this preſent. I let you know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall virgines are now diſſolute, the honour of the gods is forgotten, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> profit of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeketh, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excerciſe of chiualry ther is no memory for the orphanes &amp; widowes ther is no man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doth aunſwere, to miniſtre iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice thei haue no regard, &amp; the diſſolute vices of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> youth ar without meaſure. Finally, Rome that in times paſt was a receypt of all the good &amp; vertuous: is now made a denne of al theues &amp; vitious. I feare me, I feare me, leaſt our mother rome in ſhorte time wil haue ſome ſodein &amp; great fal. And I ſay not without a cauſe ſome great fall, for both men &amp; Cities, that fall fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the top of their felicity, purchaſe greater infamy with thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhal com after: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue had of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be paſt. Peraduenture (my childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) you deſire to ſe the walles &amp; buildinges of Rome: for thoſe thinges which childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſe firſt in their youth, the ſame they loue &amp; kepe alwaies in memory vntill their age. As the auncient buildinges of rome are deſtroyed, &amp; the few that ar now builte: ſo would I you ſhould looſe your earneſt affection to come to ſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For in dede, the noble hartes are aſhamed to ſe that thing amiſſe, which they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not remedye. Do not thynke, my chyldren, thoughe Rome be made worſe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that therfore it is diminiſhed in buildinges.

Finally ther is nothing in Rome at this day ſo euil handled, as thoſe thinges whiche by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> voices ar ordered. Theſe thinges (my childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) though I do great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lament (as it is reaſon) yet you ought litle to eſteme them al: but this al only ought to be eſtemed, &amp; with droppes of bloud to be lamented.

For the rype councel proceadeth not from the man that hath traueiled in many contreis: but from him that hath felte him ſelfe in many daungers. Since the nature of the countrey (my children) dothe knocke with the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer at the gate of the hart of man, I feare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if you come and ſe your frendes &amp; parentes, you ſhal always lyue in care &amp; penſifnes, and being penſife you ſhal always lyue euil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented, &amp; you ſhal not do y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche becommeth Romain knights to do.

Truly (my children) I know not what pleaſure is in Rome that ſhould cauſe any good man to come hyther and to forſake <hi>Affrik:</hi> for if there you haue enemies, here you ſhall want frendes.

Finallye ſeyng that that I doe ſe in Rome, and hearynge that which I heare of <hi>Affrik:</hi> I commende your warre, and abhorre our peace. If you do greatly eſteme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I haue ſayd, eſteme much more that whiche I ſhall ſay, which is, that we alwayes here that you are conquerours of the <hi>Africkans,</hi> &amp; you ſhall here always y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are conquered by vyces.

And remember that your father bequethed you nothing but weapons, and know that from me you ſhall enherite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bookes. For I had rather leaue my children good doctrine wherby they may liue: them euil riches wherby they may peryſh. I am not riche, nor I neuer trauailed to be rich, and the cauſe was that I ſaw many mens chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vndone, only through the hope they had to enherite their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes goods, and afterward went a huntinge after vices. For they ſeldome times do any worthy feates, which in their youth enherit great treaſurs. This thing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being true (as it is in dead) I do not ſay only that I would watche, and toile as many do to get riches and treaſurs: but alſo if I had treaſour, before I would gyue them vnto you, I would (as the philoſopher did) caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the fyre. For I had rather haue my children pore and vertuous in <hi>Affrike:</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> riche and vitious in Rome. You know very wel my children that there was amongeſt the <hi>Tharentins</hi> a law wel obſerued, that the ſonnes ſhoulde not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit any other thyng of their fathers but weapons to fight: and that the doughters ſhould inherit the goodes for to mary them ſelues with all. Truly this law was very iuſt, for the ſonne that hath alwayes reſpect to the enhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaunce: will not haue to his father any great confidence. For he ought to be called a valiant Romaine knight that with his life hath wonne honour, and by the ſword hath gotten riches. Since you are in ſtraung realmes, I praye you hartely that you be conuerſaunt with the good (as good brethren) reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring alwayes that you wer my children, and that I gaue you both, ſucke of myne owne propre breaſtes. And the daye that I ſhall here of your diſagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſame day ſhalbe the end of my life. For the diſcord in one citie of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes doth more harme: then a hole armie of enemys. It is good for you (my childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to liue in loue &amp; concord togethers: but it is more requiſit to kepe you with the Romaine knightes, The which with you, &amp; you with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if you do not loue together in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres: you ſhall neuer haue the vpper hand of your enemies. For in great armies, the diſcordes which riſe emongeſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do more harme: then the enemys do againſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they fight. I think wel (my children) that you wold be very deſirous to know of my eſtate (that is to wete) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am in health, whether I am ſick, whether I am poore, whether I am pleaſed, or whether I am miſcontented. In this caſe I know not why you ſhold deſire to know it, ſince you ought to preſuppoſe that accordyng to the troubles which I haue paſſed, &amp; the miſeries y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> with mine eyes I haue ſene, I am filled with this world: for wiſe men after .50. yeres and vpwarde, ought rather to apply their mindes how to receiue death: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſeke pleaſurs to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>long life. When mans fleſh is weake, it always deſireth to be wel kept euen vnto the graue. And as I am of fleſh &amp; bone: ſo I do feale the troubles of the world, as al mortal men do. But for al this do not think that to be pore or ſick is the greateſt miſery, neither thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be hole &amp; riche is the chefeſt felicity: for ther is none other felicity of the old fathers, but for to ſe their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous. In my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is an honour to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> countrey, that the fathers haue ſuch children, which wil take profit with their counſell: &amp; contrary wyſe that the children haue ſuch fathers which can giue it them. For the child is happy that
<pb facs="tcp:21411:161"/>
hath a wiſe father, &amp; more happy is the father that hath not a foliſh ſonne. I do write oft times vnto you my children, but there is a law that none be ſo hardy to write to men of war in the field, except firſt they inrowle the letters in the ſenate. Therfore ſince I write vnto you more letters then they would, they do ſend leſſe then I deſire. Thoughe this law be painefull to mothers which haue children: yet we muſt confeſſe it is profitable for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weale publik.</p>
                        <p>For if a man ſhould write to one in the warre, that his family is not well: he would forſake the warres to remedye it. Yf a man wryte vnto him that it is proſperous, he hath then a deſire to enioye it. Be not diſpleaſed (my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) thoughe all the letters I do ſende vnto you come not to your handes: For all that I do not ceaſe to viſite the temples for your owne health, nor yet to offre ſacrifices to the Gods for your honour. For if we do pleaſe the gods, we haue not cauſe to feare our enemies. I ſay no more in this caſe, my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but that I beſeche the immortall Gods, that if your lyues maye profyte the common wealth, then they ſhorten my dayes and le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthen your yeres: but if your lyues ſhould be to the domage of the common wealth, then thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall gods I deſire that firſt I may vnderſtand the end of your dayes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the wormes ſhould eate my fleſh. For rather then by your euill lyfe the glory of our predeceſſours ſhould be bleamiſhed: it were much better both your liues wer ended. The grace of the Gods, the good renowme amongeſt men, the good fortune of the Romains, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wiſedom of the greekes the bleſſing of <hi>Scippio,</hi> &amp; of al other your predeceſſours be alwayes with you my children.</p>

                     <p>ALl mortall men which will trauell, and ſee good fruite of their trauell, ought to do as the chefe artificer did that painted the world: For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man that maketh god the head of his workes, it is vnpoſſible that he ſhould erre in the ſame. That whych we beleue, and reade by wrytinge, is that the eternall created the world in ſhort ſpace by his mighte: but preſerued it a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time by his wiſedome. Wherof a man may gather, that the time to do a thing is ſhort: but the care and thought to preſerue it, is long. We ſee daily, that a valiaunt captaine aſſaulteth his enemies: but in the end it is god that giueth the victorye, but let vs aſke the conquerour, what trauell it hath bene vnto him, or wherin he hath perceaued moſt daunger (that is to wete) either to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the victory of his enemies, or els to preſerue them ſelues amongeſt the enuious and malicious. I ſweare, and affirme, that ſuch a knight wil ſwere, that ther is no compariſon betwene the one and the other: for by the bloudy ſweard in an houre the victorye is obteined: but to kepe it with reputation, the ſwete of al the life is required <hi>Laertius</hi> in the booke of the lyfe of the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers declareth, and <hi>Plato</hi> alſo hereof maketh mention, in the bookes of hys common wealth, that thoſe of <hi>Thebes</hi> vnderſtandyng that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> hadde good lawes (for that whych they were of the godes fauoured, and of menne greatly honoured) determined to ſend (by common aſſent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) a wiſe philoſopher, the beſte eſteamed amongeſt them (whoſe name was <hi>Phetonius</hi>) to whome they commaunded, that he ſhould aſke the lawes of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and that he ſhoulde be verye circumſpecte and ware to ſee what their rules and cuſtomes were.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:162"/>Thoſe of <hi>Thebes</hi> were then very noble, valliant, and honeſt: ſo that their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end was, to come to honour &amp; renowme, to erect buildinges, &amp; to make them ſelues of immortall memory for beyng vertuous. For in buildyng they were very curious: and for vertues they had good Philoſophers. The philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher <hi>Phetonius</hi> was more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a yeare in the realme of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding at ſondry times all thinges therin: for ſimple men do not note thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but onely to ſatiſfye the eyes: but the wiſe menne beholdeth them, for to know and vnderſtand their ſecrettes. After that the philoſopher had well &amp; plainely ſene and behelde all the thinges of the <hi>Lacedemonians:</hi> he determined to returne home to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and beyng arriued, all the people came to ſee him and here him. For the vanitie of the common people is of ſuch a qualitie, that it foloweth new inuentions: and deſpiſeth auncient cuſtomes. All the people therfore gathered togethers, the good philoſopher <hi>Phetonius</hi> ſet vp in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the market place a gybet, hoote yrons, a ſwerd, a whip, and fetters for the feete: the whiche thyng done, the <hi>Thebains</hi> were no leſſe as they thought ſlaundered, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abaſhed. To the which he ſpake theſe wordes. You <hi>Thebains</hi> ſente me to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> to the entent I ſhould learne their lawes and cuſtomes, and in dede I haue bene ther more then a yere, beholdyng al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges very diligentely: for we Philoſophers are bound, not onely to note that whyche is done, but alſo to know why it is done knowe ye <hi>Thebains,</hi> that this in the aunſwere of my Imbaſſage.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> hang vpon this Gybet theues, with this ſame ſworde they behede traytors, with theſe hoote Irons they torment blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and lyers, with theſe roddes they whippe vacabondes, and with theſe Irons do keape the rebels, and the others are for players, and vnthriftes. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally I ſay that I do not bryng you the lawes written, but I bring you the Inſtrumentes wherwith they are obſerued.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Thebains</hi> were abaſhed to ſe theſe thinges, and ſpake vnto hym ſuch wordes. Conſider <hi>Phetonius</hi> wee haue not ſent the to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> to bring inſtrumentes to take away life: but for the good lawes to gouerne the common wealth. The philoſopher <hi>Phetonius</hi> replyed again, &amp; aunſwered. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bains,</hi> I let you wete, that if ye know what we philoſophers knew, you ſhold ſee how far your mindes wer from the truth: For the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> are not ſo vertuous, thoroughe the lawes whych wer made of them that be dead: as for the meanes they haue ſought, to preſerue them that be alyue. For maters of Iuſtice conſiſte more in execution, then in commaundyng or ordeinynge. Lawes are eaſely ordeyned, but with difficultie executed: for there are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande to make them, but to put them in execution there is not one. Ful lytle is that whych men knowe that are preſent: in reſpect of that thoſe knewe which are paſt. But yet accordyng to my litle knowledge, I proffer to gyue as good lawes to you <hi>Thebains,</hi> as euer wer obſerued among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Lacedemonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</hi> For there is nothing more eaſy, then to know the good: and nothynge more commen, then to folow the euill. But what profiteth it if one will ordeyne, and none vnderſtand it: Yf ther be that doth vnderſtand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is none that excuteth them. Yf there be that executeth them, there is none that obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yf there be one that obſerueth them, ther is a thouſand that repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them. For without compariſon, mo are they that murmure &amp; grudge
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21411:162"/>
at the good, then thoſe whych blame and deſpiſe the euyll. You <hi>Thebains</hi> are offended, bycauſe I haue brought ſuche Inſtrumentes but I let you wete, if you wyll neyther Gybet, nor ſworde to kepe that which ſhalbe ordeyned, you ſhall haue your bookes full of lawes, and the common wealth full of vices.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore I ſweare vnto you, that there are mo <hi>Thebains</hi> whiche folowe the deliciouſnes of <hi>Denis</hi> the tyraunt: then there are vertuous men that folowe the lawes of <hi>Lycurgus.</hi> If you <hi>Thebains</hi> do deſire greatly to know, with what Lawes the <hi>Lacedemonians:</hi> doe preſerue their common wealthe: I will tel you them all by worde, and if you will reade them, I will ſhew you them in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng. But it ſhalbe vpon condition, that you ſhall ſweare all openly, that once a daye you ſhall employ your eyes to reade them, and your parſonnes to obſerue them. For the prince hath greater honour, to ſe one onely law to be obſerued in dede: then to ordeyne a thouſand by wryting. You ought not to eſteame muche to be vertuous in harte, nor to enquire of the vertue by the mouth, nor to ſeeke it by labour and trauaille of the feete: but that whyche you ought greatly to eſteame, is to know what a vertuous lawe meaneth, and that knowen, immediatly to execute it, and afterwardes to kepe it. For the chefe vertue is not to do one verteous work: but in ſwet and trauayl to continue in it. Theſe therfore wer the wordes that this philoſopher <hi>Phetonius</hi> ſayde to the <hi>Thebains.</hi> The whyche (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayeth) eſtemed more his wordes that he ſpake: then they dyd the lawes whyche he brought. Truly in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, thoſe of <hi>Thebes</hi> are to be prayſed and commended: and the philoſopher for his wordes is worthy to be honoured. For the end of thoſe was to ſearche lawes to liue well, and the ende of the Philoſophet was to ſeke good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes for to kepe them in vertue. And therfore he thought it good to ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and put before their eyes the gibbet, and the ſword, with the other inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and tormentes. For the euill do refraine from vice more for feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhement, then for any deſire they haue of amendement. I was willyng to bring in this Hiſtorie, to thende that all curious and vertuous men may ſee and know, how litell the auncientes did eſteme the beginnynge, the meane, and the ende of vertuous workes, in reſpect of the perſeueraunce and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacion of them. Commyng therfore to my matter, whych my pen doth toſſe and ſeke: I aſke now preſentely, what it profiteth princes and great ladyes, that God do gyue them great eſtates, that they be fortunate in mariages, that they be all reuerenced and honored, that they haue great treaſures for their inheritaunces, and aboue al that they ſe their wiues great with child, &amp; that afterwardes in ioy they ſe them deliuered: that they ſe theyr mothers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſucke, &amp; finally they ſe them ſelues happy in that they haue found them good nources, helthful &amp; honeſt. Truely al this auaileth litle, if to their children (when they are yong) they do not giue maſters to enſtruct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vertues: and alſo if they do not recomend them to good guides, to exerciſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in feates of Chiualry. The fathers which by ſyghes penetrat the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: by prayers importune the Liuing god only for to haue children, ought firſt to thinke why they wil haue childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for that iuſtly to any man may be denayed, which to an euil end is procured. In my opinion, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father ought to deſire to haue a child, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in his age he may ſuſteine his life in honour: &amp; that after his doth he may cauſe his fame to liue. And if a father deſireth not a ſon for this
<pb facs="tcp:21411:163"/>
cauſe, at the leaſt he ought to deſire him, to the end in his age he may honour his horye hed: and that after his death he may enheryte his goodes, but wee ſee few children do theſe thynges to their fathers in theyr age: if the fathers haue not taught them in their youth. For the fruite doeth neuer grow in the harueſt: vnleſſe the tree dyd bere bloſommes in the ſpryng. I ſee oftentimes many fathers complaine of their Children, ſayenge that they are diſobedient and proude vnto theim: and they doe not conſydre that they them ſelues are the cauſe of all thoſe euilles. For to moch aboundaunce and libertie of youth is no other: but a propheſie &amp; manifeſt token of diſobedience in age. I knowe not why princes and great lordes do toile, and oppreſſe ſo much, and ſcratche to leaue their children great eſtates, and on the other ſyde we ſee that in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng them, they are and ſhew theim ſelues to negligent: for princes &amp; great lordes ought to make account, that all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whych they leaue of their ſubſtaunce to a wicked heyre is vtterly loſt. The wiſe men, and thoſe which in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are vpright, and of their honours carefull, oughte to be very diligent to bring vp their children, &amp; chiefly that they conſyder whether they be mete to inherite their eſtates. And if perchaunce the fathers ſe that their children be more giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to follie, then to noblenes and wyſdome: then ſhould I be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſe a father that is wiſe, trauaile al the dayes of his life, to leaue much ſubſtaunce to an euill brought vp child after his death. It is a griefe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, and a monſtrous thyng to ſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cares whych the fathers take to gather ryches: and the diligence that children haue to ſpende them. And in this caſe I ſaye, the ſonne is fortunate for that he doeth inherite, and the Father a foole for that he doth bequeth.</p>
                     <p>In my opinion Fathers ar bound to enſtructe theyr Children well, for two cauſes: the one for that they are neareſt to them, and alſo bycauſe they ought to be theyr heyres. For truely with great greyfe and ſorow I ſuppoſe he doth take his death: which leaueth to a foole or an vnthrifte the toile of all his life.</p>

I complayne of my ſonne, bycauſe he hathe not bene as a gentle ſonne, but rather as a cruell enemye, for in all thynges ſince he was borne, he hath bene diſobedient to my will, wherfore I thought it good to dyſheryte hym before my death.

In that he ſayeth I haue adopted another chyld for myne heyre, I confeſſe it is true: and for ſomuche as he ſayeth that I haue dyſinheryted hym, and abiected hym from my herytage, he beynge begotten of my owne bodye, hereunto I aunſwere.</p>

The ſonne replyed to his father, and ſayd. I confeſſe I haue offended my father, and alſo I confeſſe that I haue lyued in pleaſures: yet if I maye ſpeake the trueth, thoughe I were diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and euill, my father oughte to beare the blame: and if for this cauſe he doeth dyſherite me, I thynke he doth me great iniurye. For the father that enſtructed not hys ſonne in vertue in hys youthe: wrongfullye dyſheryteth hym, though he be diſobedient in hys age. The father agayne replyeth, and ſaieth. It is true my ſonne, that I brought the vp to wantonly in thy youth, but thou knoweſt well that I haue taughte the ſondrye tymes, and beſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that I dyd correcte the when thou cameſt to ſome diſcretion. And if in thy youth I dyd not inſtructe the in learnyng, it was for that thou in thy tender age dydeſt wante vnderſtandyng: but after that thou haddeſt age to vnderſtand, diſcrecion to receiue, and ſtrength to exercyſe it: I began to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhe the, to teache the, and to inſtructe the. For where no vnderſtandyng is in the chyld, there in vaine they teache doctrine. Sence thou arte old (quoth the ſonne) and I yong, ſence thou arte my father, and I thy ſonne, for that thou haſt whyte heres of thy bearde, and I none at all: it is but reaſon that thou be beleued, &amp; I condemned. For in this world we ſe oftetimes, that the ſmal aucthoryty of the parſon, maketh hym to loſe hys great iuſtyce. I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the (my father) that when I was a childe, thou dydſt cauſe me to learne to reade: but thou wylte not denye, that if I dyd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any faulte, thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt neauer agree I ſhould be punyſhed. And hereof it came, that thou ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng me to doe what I woulde in my youth, haue bene dyſobedient to the euer ſince in my age. And I ſaye to the further, that if in this caſe I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended trulye me thinketh thou canſt not be excuſed: for the fathers in the youthe of their children, oughte not onely to teache them to diſpute of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and what vertue is: but they ought to inforce them to be vertuous in dede. For it is a good token when youth (before they know vyces) hath bene accuſtomed to practice vertues. Both parties thou diligentlie hard, the good Philoſopher <hi>Solon Solinon</hi> ſpake theſe wordes I geue iudgement that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thys child be not buried after hys death: and I commaunde that the ſonne, bycauſe in hys youth he hath not obeyed his father who is olde, ſhould be dyſinheryted whiles the father lyueth from all hys ſubſtaunce, on ſuche condition, that after hys death, hys ſonnes ſhould inheryte the heritage, and ſo returne to the heires of the ſonne and line of the father. For it were vniuſt, that the innocencie of the ſonne ſhould be condempned, for the offence of the father. I doe commaunde alſo, that all the goods be committed vnto ſome faithful parſon, to thend they may geue the father meate and drinke durynge hys lyfe, and to make a graue for the ſonne after hys death. I haue not with out a cauſe geuen ſuche iudgement, the which comprehendeth lyfe and death: for the Gods wyll not, that for one pleaſure the punyſhement be double, but that we chaſtyſe and punyſhe the one in the lyfe, takynge from hym hys ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and goods: and that we punyſhe others after there death, takyng from them memorye and buriall.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:164"/>Truly the ſentence which the Philoſopher gaue was graue, and would to God we had him for a iudge of this world preſentlye: for I ſweare, that he ſhould finde many children now a dayes for to diſheryte, and mo fathers to puniſhe. For I cannot tell which is greater, the ſhame of the children to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their fathers: or the negligence of the fathers in bringing vp their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> in the ſecond boke of the ſainges of the Philoſophers decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that a citezen of <hi>Athens</hi> ſayed on daye to Dyogenes the Phyloſopher theſe wordes. Tel me Diogenes, what ſhall I doe to be in the fauour of the gods, and not in the hatred of men? for oft tymes amonges you Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers I haue hard ſaye, that there is great difference betwene that that the Goddes wil, and that which men loue. <hi>Diogenes</hi> aunſwered. Thou ſpeakeſt more then thoughteſt to ſpeake, that the gods will one thinge, and men ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the gods are but as a center of mercy, and men are but as a denne of malice, if thou wilte inioye reſt in thy dayes, and keape thy lyfe pure and cleane: thou muſt obſerue theſe thre thinges.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, honour thy gods deuoutly. For the man which doeth not ſerue and honour the gods, in all his enterpriſes he ſhalbe vnfortunate.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, be very diligent to bring vp thy children well. For the man hath no enemy ſo troubleſome, as his owne ſon, if he be not wel brought vp.</p>
                     <p>The third thyng, be thankefull to thy good benefactours and frendes. For the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> ſayeth, that the man who is vnthankefull, of all the worlde ſhalbe abhorred. And I tell the further my frend, that of theſe thre thinges the moſt profitable (though it be more trobleſome) is for a manne to teache and bring vp his children well.</p>
                     <p>This therefore was the aunſwere that the Philoſopher <hi>Diogenes</hi> made to the demaunde of the Cytezen. It is great pytie and griefe, to ſee a yonge child how the bloud doth ſtirre him, to ſe how the fleſhe doth prouoke him to accompliſhe his deſire, to ſe ſenſualyte go before, and he himſelfe to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, to ſe the malicious world to watche him, to ſe howe the deuill doth tempt him, to ſe how vyces bynde him, and in all that whych is ſpoken, to ſe how the father is negligent as if he had no children: wher as in deed the old man, by the few vertues that he hath had in his youth: may eaſely know the infirmites and vices, wherewith his ſonne is compaſſed. If the expert had neuer ben ignoraunt, if the fathers had neuer ben children, if the vertuous had neuer ben vicious, if the fyne wittes had neuer ben deceiued, it were no meruaile if the Fathers were negligent in teachyng their children. For the lytell experience excuſeth men of great offences: but ſynce thou arte a father, and that fyrſt thou were a ſonne, ſynce thou arte old, and haſt ben yong, and beſides al this, ſynce that pride hath enflamed the, lechery hath burned the, wrath hath wounded the, neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hath hindred the, couetouſnes hath blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the, and glotonie ſurfeted the, tell me cruell father, ſince ſo manye vices haue reigned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>: why haſt thou not an eye to thy childe, whom of thy owne bloud thou haſt begotten? And if thou doeſt it not bycauſe he is thy childe, thou oughteſt to do it bycauſe he is thy neareſt. For it is vnpoſſible that the child whych with many vyces is aſſaulted, and not ſuccoured: but in the end he ſhould be infamed and to the diſhonour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father moſt wickedly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. It is vnpoſſible to kepe fleſh well fauored, vnleſſe it be firſt ſalted. It is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21411:164"/>
vnpoſſible that the fiſhe ſhould liue without water. It is vnpoſſible but that the Roſe ſhould wyther, whiche is of the thorne ouergrowen. So like it is vnpoſſible that the fathers ſhould haue any comforte of their chyldren in their age, vnleſſe they haue inſtructed them in vertue in their youth. And to ſpeake further in this matter I ſaye, that in the Chriſtian catholike reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where in dede there is good doctrine, ther alwayes is ſuppoſed to be a good conſcience. Amongeſt the wryters it is a thinge well knowen, howe <hi>Eſchines,</hi> the philoſopher was baniſhed from <hi>Athens,</hi> and with all his family came to dwell at <hi>Rhodes.</hi> The occaſion was, becauſe that he and the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> were in great contention in the common wealth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Athenians</hi> determined to baniſh the one, and to keape the other with them. And truly they dyd well, for of the contentions and debates of ſages, warres moſt commonly aryſe amongeſt the people. This philoſopher <hi>Eſchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> being at <hi>Rhodes</hi> baniſhed, amongeſt others made a ſolempne oration, wherein he greatly reproueth the <hi>Rhodians</hi> that they were ſo negligente in brynging vp their children, ſaiyng vnto them theſe wordes. I let you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande (Lordes of <hi>Rhodes</hi>) that your predeceſſours aduaunced them ſelues to diſcende, and to take their beginning of the <hi>Lides:</hi> the whiche aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations were curious and diligent to bring vp their children: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of came a lawe that was among them, which ſayed.</p>
                     <p>We ordeine and commaunde, that if a father haue many chyldren, that the moſte vertuous ſhould enherite the goods, and riches: and if there were but one vertuous, that he alone ſhould inherite the whole. And if perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the children were vitious, that then al ſhould be depriued from the heritage. For the goods gotten with trauaile of vertuous fathers, ought not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be inherited with vitious children. Theſe were the wordes that the philoſopher ſpake to the Senate of the <hi>Rhodes:</hi> and becauſe he ſayde in that Oration many other thinges whiche touche not our matter, I wyll in this place omitte them. For among excellent wryters, the wryting loſeth muche authoritie, when the authour from his purpoſe digreſſeth into an other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. To ſaye the truthe, I doe not maruayle that the children of princes and great lordes be adulterers, and belly gods: for that on the one parte youth is the mother of Idlenes, and on the other, litle experience is the cauſe of great offences. And furthermore the fathers being once dead, the children enherite their goodes as quietly, being loden with vices: as if in dede they were with all vertues endued. If the younge children did knowe for a certaine, that the lawes of the <hi>Lydes</hi> ſhould be obſerued (that is to witte) that they ſhoulde not enherite, vnleſſe they be vertuous: it is vnpoſſible but that they would leade a good life, and not in this wyſe to runne at large in the worlde. For they doe abſteine more from doing euill, fearyng to loſe that whiche they doe poſſeſſe: then for any loue to doe that whiche they ought. I doe not denaye, but according as the natures of the fathers is dyuers, ſo the inclinations of the chyldren are variable. For ſo muche as ſome folowyng their good incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are good, &amp; others not reſiſting euil ſenſualities are euill. But yet in this matter I ſaye, that it lieth muche in the father that doeth brynge them vp, when as yet they are younge: ſo that the euill whiche nature gaue, by good bryngyng vp is refrayned. For oftetymes the good cuſtome, doeth
<pb facs="tcp:21411:165"/>
ouercome all euill inclination. Princes and great lordes that wylbe diligent in the inſtruction of their chyldren, ought to enforme their maiſters and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that ſhall teache theim, to what vyces and vertues their children are moſte inclined: and this ought to be, to encourage them in that that is good, and contrary to reproue them in all that is euill. For men are vndone for no other cauſe when they be olde: but for that they had ſo much pleaſures when they are younge. <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> in the ſeconde booke of the ſaiynges of the auntientes ſaieth, that on a daye a citezen of <hi>Athens</hi> was byenge thinges in the market, and for the qualitie of his perſone, the greateſt parte of them were ſuperfluous and nothing neceſſary. And in this caſe the poore are no leſſe culpable then the ryche: and the ryche then the poore. For that is ſo litle, that to ſuſteyne mans lyfe is neceſſary: that he which hath leſt, hath therunto ſuperfluous. Therfore at that tyme, when <hi>Athens</hi> and her common wealth was the lanterne of all Grece, there was in <hi>Athens</hi> a lawe long vſed, and of great tyme accuſtomed: that nothing ſhould be bought before a philoſopher had ſet the pryce. And truly the lawe was good, and would to God the ſame lawe at this preſent were obſerued: for there is nothing that deſtroyeth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth more, then to permitte ſome to ſell as tyrauntes, and others to buye as fooles. When the <hi>Thebane</hi> was buying theſe thinges, a philoſopher was there preſent, who ſayed vnto him theſe wordes. Tell me I praye thee, thou man of <hi>Thebes,</hi> wherefore doeſt thou conſume and waſte thy money, in that whiche is not neceſſary for thy houſe, nor profitable for thy perſone? the <hi>Thebane</hi> aunſwered him. I let the knowe, that I doe buye all theſe thynges for a ſonne I haue of the age of .xx. yeares, the whiche neuer did thinge that ſeamed vnto me euill, nor I neuer denayed hym any thing that he demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This philoſopher aunſwered. O howe happy were thou, if as thou arte a father, thou were a ſonne, and that which the father ſaieth vnto the ſonne, the ſonne would ſaye vnto the father: but I am offended greatly with that thou haſt tolde me. For vntill the childe be .xxv. yeares olde, he ought not to gayneſaye his father: and the good father ought not to condeſcende vnto the appetites of the ſonne. Nowe I call the curſed father, ſince thou arte ſubiect to the wyll of thy ſonne: and that thy ſonne is not obedient to the wyl of his father, ſo that thou altereſt the order of nature. For ſo muche as the father is ſonne of his ſonne, and the ſonne is father of his father. But in the end, I ſweare vnto thee by the immortall Gods, that when thou ſhalt become old, thou ſhalt weape by thy ſelfe at that whiche with thy ſonne thou diddeſt laughe when he was younge. Though the wordes of this philoſopher were fewe: yet a wyſe man wyll iudge the ſentences to be many. I conclude ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that princes and great lordes ought to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mende their children to their maiſters, to thende they may teache them to chaunge their appetites, and not to folowe their owne wil: ſo that they withdrawe them from their own will, and cauſe them to learne the aduiſe of an other. For the more a man ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth a noble man ſonne the brydle, the more harder it is for them to receiue good doctrine.</p>

                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:21411:165"/>BY experience we ſee, that in warre (for the defence of men) rampiers &amp; fortes are made according to the qualitie of the enemies, &amp; thoſe which ſayle the daungerous ſeas, doe choſe great ſhippes, whiche may breake the waues of the raging Sea: ſo that all wyſe men according to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the daunger, doe ſeke for the ſame in time ſome remedy. Oftetymes I muſe with my ſelfe, and thynke if I coulde finde any eſtate, any age, any lande, any nation, any realme, or any worlde, wherein there hath bene any man that hath paſſed this life, without taſting, what aduerſitie was: for if ſuche a one were founde, I thinke it ſhould be a monſtrous thing through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the earth, and by reaſon both the dead and liuing ſhould enuie hym. In the ende, after my counte made, I finde that he whiche yeſterdaye was ryche, to daye is poore: he that was hole, I ſee hym to daye ſicke: he that ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdaye laughed, to daye I ſee hym wepe: he that had his hartes eaſe, I ſee hym nowe ſore afflicted: he that was fortunate, I ſee hym vnlucky: finally, hym whom we knewe aliue in the towne, now we ſee buried in the graue. And to be buried is nothing els, but to be vtterly forgotten: for mans frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhyp is ſo frayle, that when the corps is couered with earth, immediatly the dead is forgotten. One thinge me thinketh to all men is greuous, &amp; to thoſe of vnderſtandyng no leſſe payneful, whiche is, that the miſeries of this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked worlde are not equally deuided, but that oftetymes all worldly calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties lieth in the necke of one man alone. For we are ſo vnfortunate, that the world geueth vs pleaſures in ſight, &amp; troubles in profe. If a man ſhould aſke a ſage man now a daies, who hath liued in meane eſtate, &amp; that he would be contented to tel him what he hath paſte, ſince three yeares that he began to ſpeake, vntill fifty yeares that he began to waxe olde: what thinges thinke you he would tel vs, that hath chaunced vnto him? truly al theſe that here folowe The grefes of his children, the aſſaultes of his enemies, the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of his wife, the wantonnes of his doughters, ſicknes in his perſon, great loſſe of goods, general famine in the citie, cruel plagues in his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, extreme colde in wynter, noyſome heate in ſommer, ſorowful deathes of his frendes, &amp; enuious proſperities of his enemies: finally he wil ſay, that he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch &amp; ſo many thinges, that oftimes he bewailed the wofull life, &amp; deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſwete death. If the miſerable man hath paſſed ſuch things outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what would he ſaye of thoſe which he hath ſuffred inwardly? the whiche though ſome diſcrete men may know, yet truly others dare not tell. For the trauailes which the body paſſeth in fifty yeres, may wel be counted in a day: but that which the hart ſuffereth in one day, cannot be counted in a hundred yeres. A man cannot denay, but that we would cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te him raſhe, which with a rede would mete an other that hath a ſword: &amp; him for a foole, that would put of his ſhoes to walke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thornes. But without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon we ought to eſteame him for the moſt foole, that with this tender fleſhe thinketh to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile againſt ſo many euil fortunes: for without doubt, the man that is of his body delicate, paſſeth his life with much paine. O how happy may that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be called, which neuer taſted what pleaſure meaneth. For men whiche from their infancy haue bene brought vp in pleaſures, for want of wiſdome know not how to choſe the good, &amp; for lack of force cannot reſiſte the euil: which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe, that noble mens children ofttimes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſondrye heynous offences.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:166"/>
For it is an infallible rule, that the more a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> geueth him ſelfe to pleaſures, the more he is entangled in vices. It is a thing worthy to be noted, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſee, how politike we be to augmente thinges of honour, how bolde we be to enterpriſe them, how fortunate to compas them, how diligent to kepe them, how circumſpect to ſuſteine them, and afterwarde what pitie is it to ſee, how vnfortunate we are to loſe all that, whiche ſo longe time we haue ſearched for, kept, and poſſeſſed. And that which is moſte to be lamented in this caſe is, that the goodes and honour are not loſt for wante of diligence &amp; trauaile of the father: but for the aboundaunce of pleaſures, and vices of the ſonne. Finallye let the riche man knowe, that that which he hath wonne in labour and toyle waking: his ſonne (being euill brought vp) ſhall conſume in pleaſures ſleaping. One of the greateſt vanities that reigneth at this day among the children of vanitie is, that the father can not ſhew vnto his ſonne the loue which he beareth him, but in ſuffering him to be brought vp in the pleaſures and vanities of this life. Truly he that is ſuch a one, ought not to be called a pitifull father, but a cruel ſtepfather: for no man wil denie me this, but that where there is youth, libertie, pleaſure, and money, there will all the vices of this world be reſident. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the great king, geuer of lawes, and ſage philoſopher, ordeined to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> that all the children whiche were borne in cities, &amp; good townes, ſhould be ſent to bringe vp in villages till they were .xxv. yeares of age. As <hi>Liuius</hi> ſaith that the <hi>Lygures</hi> were, which in olde time were confederate with thoſe of <hi>Capua,</hi> and great enemies to the people of Rome. They had a lawe amongeſt them, that none ſhould take wages in the warres, vnleſſe he had bene brought vp in the fieldes, or that he had bene a heard man in the mountaines: ſo that through one of theſe twoo wayes, their fleſh was hardned, their ioyntes accuſtomed to ſuffer the heate and the colde, and their bodies more mete to endure the trauayles of the warres. In the yeare of the foundation of Rome, a hundred and fourty, the Romaines made cruell warres with the <hi>Lygures,</hi> againſt whome was ſent <hi>Gneus Fabritius,</hi> of the which in the ende he triumphed: and the day folowyng this triumphe, he ſpake vnto the Senate theſe wordes. Worthy Senatours I haue bene theſe fiue yeares againſt the <hi>Ligures,</hi> and by the immortall gods I ſwere vnto you, that in al this time there paſſed not one weke, but we had either battaile, or ſome perilous ſkermiche. And that whiche a man oughte moſte to marueile at is, that I neuer perceiued any feare or cowardlynes to be in thoſe barbarous people, whereby they were conſtrained to demaunde peace of the people of Rome. Theſe <hi>Lygures</hi> purſued with ſuche fearcenes the warres, that oftetimes they toke awaye from vs all hope to winne the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: for betwene armies, the great might of the one, doth put alwayes the others in feare. And I wyll tell you (fathers conſcript) their brynging vp, to the ende the Romaine youth ſhould take hereby example. When they are young, they are put to be ſhepeheardes becauſe they ſhould accuſtome their fleſhe in the mountaines to endure trauaile: by the whiche cuſtome they are ſo much maiſters of them ſelues (the countrey being alwayes ful of ſnowe &amp; Iſe in the wynter, &amp; alſo noiſome through the extreame heate in the So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer that I ſweare by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god <hi>Apollo,</hi> in al this time of fiue yeres, of thoſe we haue not ſene one preaſe to the fire in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> winter, nor couet the ſhadow in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſommer.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21411:166"/>
Do not ye thinke worthy Senatours, that I was willing to declare vnto you theſe thinges in the Senate, for any deſire I haue that you ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteame any thing the more my triumphe: but I doe tell it you to this ende, that you may haue an eie, and take heade to your men of warre, to the ende they may alwayes be occupied, and that you ſuffer them not to be idle. For it is more perilous for the Romaine armies, to be ouercome with vices: then to be diſconfited with their enemies. And to talke of theſe matters more at large, me thinketh they ſhould prouide &amp; commaunde, that riche men ſhould not be ſo hardy to bring vp their children to delicatly: for in the ende, it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that the delicate perſone ſhould winne with his handes, the honour of many victories. That which moued me to ſaye ſo muche as I haue ſayed (worthy Senatours) is to the end you may know, that the <hi>Ligures</hi> were not ouercome by the power of Rome: but becauſe fortune was againſt them. And ſince in nothing fortune ſheweth her ſelfe ſo variable, as in the thinges of warre: me thinketh that though the <hi>Ligures</hi> are nowe vanquiſhed &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, yet notwithſtanding you ought to entertaine them in loue, &amp; to take them for your confederates. For it is not good councell, to hazarde that into the handes of fortune, which a man may compaſſe by frendſhip. The authour of this whiche is ſpoken, is called <hi>Iunius Pratus,</hi> in the booke of the concorde of Realmes, and he ſaith in that place, that this captaine <hi>Gneus Fabritius,</hi> was counted no leſſe ſage for that he ſpake: then eſteamed valiaunte for that he did. In the olde time, thoſe of the Iles <hi>Balleares</hi> (whiche nowe are called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iorque,</hi> and <hi>Minorque</hi>) though they were not counted wyſe: yet at the leaſt in bringing vp their children, they ſhewed them ſelues not negligent. Becauſe they were brought vp in hardnes in their youth, and could not endure all painefull exerciſes of the warres. Thoſe of <hi>Carthage</hi> gaue fiue priſoners of Rome, for one ſclaue of <hi>Maiorque. Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſaith, in thoſe Iles, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not geue the children bread with their own handes: but they did put it on an high pole, ſo that they might ſee the bread with their eies, but they could not reache it with their handes. Wherefore when they woulde eate, they ſhould firſte with hurling of ſtones, or ſlinges winne it, or elles faſte. Though the worke were of children: yet the inuention came of a high wyt. And hereof it came that the <hi>Balleares</hi> were eſteamed for valiaunt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as well in wraſtling, as in ſlinges for to hurle: for they did hurle with a ſlinge to hit a white, as the <hi>Lygures</hi> ſhoote nowe in a croſſe bowe to hitte the prick. Thoſe of great <hi>Britayne,</hi> whiche nowe we call Englande, amongeſt all the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, were men moſt barbarous: but you ought to knowe, that within the ſpace of fewe yeares, the Romaines were vanquiſhed of them many tymes. For tyme in all thinges bringeth ſuch chaunge &amp; alteration, that thoſe which once we knew great lordes: within a while after we haue ſene them ſclaues. <hi>Herodian</hi> in his hyſtory of <hi>Seuerus</hi> Emperour of Rome ſaieth, that an Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of Britayne being one daye in Rome (as by chaunce they gaue hym a froward aunſwere in the Senate) ſpake ſtoutely before them all, and ſaid theſe wordes. I am ſory you will not accepte peace, nor graunte truce: the whiche thing ſhalbe for the greater iuſtification of our warres. For after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes none can take, but that whiche fortune ſhall geue. For in the ende the delicate fleſhe of Rome ſhal fele, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloudy ſwordes of Britayne wil cut.

The Engliſhe hiſtorie ſaieth, and it is true, that though the countrey be very colde, and that the water freſeth ofte: yet the women had a cuſtome to cary their children where the water was froſen, &amp; breaking the Iſe with a ſtone, with the ſame Iſe they vſed to rubbe the body of the infante, to the ende to harden their fleſhe, and to make them more apt er to endure trauailes. And without doubt they had reaſon, for I wyſhe no greater penitence to delicate men, then in the wynter to ſee them without fire: and in the Sommer to wante freſhe ſhadow. Sith this was the cuſtome of the Britayns, it is but reaſon we credit <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in that he ſaieth in his comentaries, that is to wete, that he paſſed many daungers before he could ouercome them: for thei with as litle feare did hyde them ſelues, and dyued vnder the cold water, as a very man would haue reſted him ſelfe in a pleaſaunt ſhadowe.

In this caſe we can not cal them barbarous, but we ought to cal them men of good vnderſtanding: for it is vnpoſſible for the man that eateth muche, to runne faſt. <hi>Viriatus</hi> (a Spanyarde) was king of the <hi>Luſytaines,</hi> and a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of the Romains, who was ſo aduenterous in the warre, &amp; ſo valiaunt in his perſone, that the Romains (by the experience of his dedes) found him vnuincible. For in the ſpace of .xiii. yeres they could neuer haue any victory of him: the whiche when they ſawe, they determined to poyſon him, &amp; did ſo in dede. At whoſe death they more reioyſed, then if they had wonne the ſignorie of all <hi>Luſitanie.</hi> For if <hi>Viriatus</hi> had not died, they had neuer brought the <hi>Luſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> vnder their ſubiection. <hi>Iunius Ruſticus</hi> in his epitomie ſaith, that this <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatus</hi> in his youth was a herde man, &amp; kept cattel by the ryuer of <hi>Guadiana,</hi> &amp; after that he waxed older, vſed to robbe, &amp; aſſault men by the highe wayes. And after that he was .xl. yeares of age, he became king of the <hi>Luſitaines,</hi> and not by force, but by election. For when the people ſawe theym ſelues en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uirouned and aſſaulted on euery ſide with enemies: they choſe rather ſtout, ſtrong, and hardy men for their captaines, then noble men for their guydes. If the auncient hyſtoriographers deceiue me not, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Viriatus</hi> was a thefe, he led with him alwayes at the leaſte a hundred theues: the whiche were ſhodde with leaden ſhoes, ſo that when they were enforced to ronne, they put of their ſhoes. And thus although all the daye they wente with leaden ſhoes, yet in the night they ranne lyke ſwyfte buckes: for it is a generall rule, that the loſer the ioyntes are, the more ſwifter ſhall the legges be to ronne. In the booke of the ieſtes of the Lumbardes, <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> ſayeth, that in the olde tyme thoſe of <hi>Capua</hi> had a lawe, that vntyl the chyldren were maryed, the fathers ſhold geue them no bedde to ſleape on, nor permit them to ſitte at the table to eate: but that they ſhould eate their meates in their handes, and take their reſte on the grounde. And truely it was a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable lawe, for reſte was neuer inuented for the younge man whiche hath no bearde: but for the aged, beinge lame, impotent, and crooked. <hi>Quintus Cincinatus</hi> was ſeconde Dictator of Rome, and in dede for his deſertes was
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21411:167"/>
the firſt emperour of the earth. This excellente man was broughte vp in ſo great trauaile, that his hands were found full of knottes, the ploughe was in his armes, and the ſwette in his face when he was ſought to be Dictator of Rome. For the auncientes deſired rather to be ruled of them that knewe not, but how to plow the ground: then of them that delyted in nothing els, but to liue in pleaſurs among the people. <hi>Caligula</hi> which was the fourth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of Rome (as they ſay) was brought vp with ſuch coſt and delicatnes in his youth, that they were in doubt in Rome, whether <hi>Druſius Germanicus</hi> hys father employed more for the Armyes: then <hi>Calligula</hi> hys ſonne ſpent in the cradel for his pleaſurs. This reherſed agayne, I would now knowe of princes &amp; great lordes what part they would take (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to wete) whether w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Cincinatus,</hi> whych by his ſtoutnes wanne ſo many ſtraunge countreys: or with <hi>Caligula,</hi> that in hys fylthy luſtes ſpared not his proper ſiſter. In myne opinyon, ther nedeth no great deliberacion to aunſwere this queſtyon (that is to wete) the goodnes of the one, and the wickednes of the other: for there was no battayle but <hi>Cincinatus</hi> did ouercome, nor there was any vyce but <hi>Caligula</hi> dyd inuent. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> in the ſecond booke of <hi>Ceſars</hi> ſayth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when the chyldren of the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar</hi> entred into the hygh ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol, wher al the ſenate were aſſembled, the Senatours roſe out of their pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, and made a reuerence to the children, the whych when the Emperoure <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſaw, he was much diſpleaſed, and called them backe agane. And on a day being demaunded why he loued his children no better, he aunſwered in this wiſe. If my chyldren wil be good, they ſhal ſyt hereafter wher I ſit now: but if they be euil, I will not their vices ſhold be reuerenced of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours. For the aucthoritie &amp; grauity of the good, ought not to be employed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruice of thoſe that be wicked. The 26. Emperour of Rome was <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> the which (though he was yong) was aſmuch eſteamed for hys vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es amongeſt the Romaynes: as euer. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great was for hys vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auntnes amongeſt the Grekes. We can not ſay, that long experience cauſed him to come to the gouernment of the common wealth, for as <hi>Herodian</hi> ſaith in his ſyxt booke, the day that the Senatours proclamed him emperour, he was ſo lytle that his owne men bare him in their armes. That fortunate Emperour had a mother called <hi>Mamea,</hi> the which brought him vp ſo wel, &amp; dilygently, that ſhe kept alwayes a great gard of men to take hede, that no vicious ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came vnto him. And let not the diligence of the mother to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> child be litle eſtemed: For princes oft times of their owne nature are good, &amp; by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyl conuerſacion only they are made euil. This worthy woman kepyng al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſuch a faythful gard of her chyld, that no flatterers ſhould enter in to flatter him, nor malicious to tel hym lyes: bychaunce on a day a Romaine ſayd vnto her theſe words. I thinke it not mete (moſt excellente princeſſe) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ſhoulde be ſo dyligente aboute thy ſonne, to forget the affaires of the common wealth: for prynces ought not to be kept ſo cloſe, that it is more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſye to obtaine a ſute at the gods, then to ſpeake one word with the prince.</p>
                     <p>To this the Empreſſe <hi>Mamea</hi> aunſwered, and ſaid. They which haue charge to gouerne thoſe that do gouerne, withoute compariſon oughte to feare more the vyces of the kinge: thenne the ennemyes of the Realme. For the ennemyes are deſtroyed in a battaile, but vyces remayne durynge the life,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:168"/>
and in the end, enemyes do not deſtroy but the poſſeſſions of the land, but the vycious prince deſtroyeth the good maners of the comon wealth. Theſe wordes were ſpoken of this worthye Romaine. By the hiſtories which I haue declared, and by thoſe which I omitte to recite, al verteous men may know, how much it profiteth them to bring vp their children in trauailes, or to bring them vp in pleaſures. But now I ymagine, that thoſe which ſhall read this, will praiſe that which is wel writen: and alſo I truſt they wil not giue their children ſo much their owne willes. For men that read much, &amp; worke litle: are as belles the which do ſound to cal others, and they theim ſelues neuer enter into the church. If the fathers did not eſteame the ſeruice they do vnto God, their owne honour, nor the profite of their owne children: yet to preſerue them from diſſeaſes, they ought to bring them vp in vertue, &amp; withdraw them from vices. For truly the children which haue bene brought vp daintely, ſhal alwayes be diſeaſed and ſikely. What a thinge is it to ſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of a labourer, the cote without pointes, the ſhyrte tottered and torne, their feete bare, their head without a cappe, the body withoute a girdle, in ſommer without a hat, in winter without a cloke, in the day ploughing, in the night driuing his herd, eating bread of Rye or Otes, lyeng on the earth, or els on the ſtrawe: and in this trauaile to ſe this yong man ſo holy &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, that euery man deſireth and wiſheth, that he had ſuch a ſonne. The contrarie commeth of noble mens ſonnes, the which we ſe are nouriſhed &amp; brought vp betwene two fine holland ſheetes, layed in a coſtly cradel, made after the new faſhion: they giue the nourſe what ſhe wil deſire, if perchaunce the child be ſicke, they chaunge his nource, or els they appoint him a diet. The father and the mother ſlepe neither night nor daye, all the houſe watcheth, they let him eate nothing but the broth of chyckins, they kepe hym diligente<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly that he fal not downe the ſtayres, the child aſketh nothing but it is geuen him immediatly. Finally they ſpend their time in ſeruyng them: they waſte their riches in geuyng them their delights, they occupie their eyes but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, &amp; they imploye not their harts, but to loue them. But I ſweare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe fathers (whiche on this wiſe do ſpend their riches to pomper theim) ſhal one day water their eyes to bewaile theym: What it is to ſe the waſt, that a vaine man maketh in bringinge vp his child? ſpecially if he be a man ſumwhat aged, &amp; that at his deſire hath a child borne. He ſpendeth ſo muche goodes in bringing his vp wantonly, whyles he is yong: that oft times he wanteth to mary him when he commeth to age. And that which worſt of al is, that that which he ſpendeth and employeth he thynketh it wel beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, and thinketh that to much that he geueth for gods ſake.</p>
                     <p>Though the fathers are very large in ſpendinge, the mothers very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the norces ful of pleaſures, and the ſeruauntes very dilygente and attentiue: yet it foloweth not that the children ſhould be more hole then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For the more they are attented, the more they be diſſeaſed: the more they eate, the more they are weake: the more they reioyce, the worſe they proſper: the more they waſt and ſpend, ſoo muche leſſe they profite. And all this is not without the ſecret permiſſion of God. For God wil not that the cloutes of children be of greater value, then the garments of the poore. God without a greate miſterie toke not in hande the cuſtodye of the poore, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21411:168"/>
doth not ſuffer that the children of the rich men ſhould proſper: For the good bringeth vp his children without the preiudyce of the rich, and to the profit of the comon wealth: but the rich bringeth vp his children wyth the ſwet of the poore, and to the domage of the common wealth. Therfore if this thyng be true (as it is) it is but reaſon that the wolfe whych deuoureth vs do dye: and the ſhepe which clotheth vs do lyue. The fathers oft times for tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wyl not teach nor bryng vp their children in doctrine, ſayeng that as yet he is to yong, and that there remayneth time enough for to be learned, and that they haue leyſure enough to be taught: and further for the more excuſe of their error they affirme, that when the chyld in his youth is chaſtned, he ronneth in daunger of his health. But the euil reſpect which the fathers hath to their chyldren, God ſuffereth afterwards that they come to be ſo ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous to the common wealth, ſo infamous to their parents, ſo diſobedient to their fathers, ſo euyl in their condicions, ſo vnaduiſed and light in their behauiour, ſo vnmeate for knowledge, ſo vncorrigible for diſciplyne, ſo incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to lies, ſo enuyeng the truth: that their fathers would not only haue pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with ſharpe correction: but alſo they woulde reioyce to haue them buryed with bytter teares. An other thyng ther is in this matter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be noted, and much more worthyer to be commended, that is, that the Fathers and mothers vnder the couller that their chyldren ſhould be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what gracious, they learne them to ſpeake, to bable, &amp; to be great mockers and ſcoffers, the which thing afterwards redoundeth to the great infamye and diſhonour of the Father, to the great peril of the ſonne, and to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt griefe and diſpleaſure of the mother. For the child which is brought vp wantonly without doctrine in his youth: of neceſſity muſt be a foole when he is old. If this which I haue ſayd be euil, this which I wil ſay is worſe: that the Fathers, and mothers, the gouernours, or nources, do teach them to ſpeake diſhoneſt things, the which are not lawful, and therfore ought not to be ſuffered to be ſpoken in that tender age: nor the grauitie of the auncients ought not to lyſten vnto them. For there are no men (vnleſſe they be ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) that wil permit their children to be great bablers. Thoſe which haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charge to gouerne good mens children ought to be very circumſpect, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they kepe them in awe, feare &amp; ſubiection, &amp; that they ought not to be contented, though the fathers ſay they are pleaſed. For the diſordinate loue that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue to them, is the cauſe that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſe whether they be mockers or euil brought vp. And if it chaunced (as ofttimes it doth) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the father ſhold come to the maiſter to cauſe him to withdraw correction, in this caſe, if the maſter be a wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he ought no leſſe to reproue &amp; admoniſh the father: then to correct the ſonne. And if this did not auaile, I councel him to forſake and leaue his charge. For the man of an honeſt nature, after he hath taken anye charge in hand, wil eyther bring it to paſſe, or els he wil dye in the ſame. I wyl not denaye, but that it is reaſon noble mennes ſonnes be more gently brought vp, handled, and honoured, then the ſonnes of the <hi>Plebeiens:</hi> for more delicately is the palme tree, which bringeth forth dates, cheriſhed: then the oke which bringeth forth Akornes, wherwith the hogges are nouriſhed. Let princes and great lordes beware, that the pleaſures which they gaue their childre in theyr youthe, be not ſo exceſſyue, nor of ſoo longe continuaunce:
<pb facs="tcp:21411:169"/>
that when they would withdraw them, the world hath not alredy feſtered them. For the children brought vp with to much delicateneſſe, are diſobedient to their fathers and mothers, or els they are ſicke in their bodyes, or worſe then that, they are vicious in their behauiours: ſo that their fathers ſhold be better to burye theym quycke, then to bring them vp vycious.</p>

                     <p>WHen he that is without end, gaue beginning to the world, in this ſort he beganne. The Sonday he created heauen and earth, The Mondaye he created the element, the Tueſday he created the Planettes, the Wedneſday he created the Sonne and the Mone, the Thurſday he created the birdes in the ayre, and the fiſhes in the ſea, the fryday he created Adam and Eue hys wife, and truly in that he created, and how he created, hee ſhewed himſelfe as God. For as ſone as the houſe was made, he forniſhed &amp; peopled it with that that was neceſſarie, as he could wel do. Omitting therfore the creator, and talking of creatures: we ſe by experience, that a houſeholder in planting a vineyarde, immediatly maketh a hedge, to the ende that the beaſts do not hurt it, and eate it vp. And when it is wel growen he hyreth ſome poore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borer to watche, that trauailers do not gather nor eate the grapes therof. The rich man that traffiqueth by ſea, after he hath made a great ſhippe, and beſtowed vi. or vii. thouſand ducates, if he be wiſe, he wil firſt prouide a man that may gouerne her, before he wil ſeke marchaundiſe for to fraite her: for in perilous tempeſtes the greatnes of the ſhippe lytel auayleth, if the pilot therof be not expert. The houſeholder that hath many cowes and ſhepe, and likewiſe hath faire feeldes, and pleaſaunt paſtures for his cattel, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeke herdmen to kepe the cattell, but alſo dogges to feare the wolfes, and cabannes to lodge the herdmen. For the cabanne of the ſhepherdes, and the baying of the dogge, is but as a ſauegard of the ſhepe, from the raueninge of the wolfe. The mightie and valiaunte princes whiche in the frontiers of their enemyes kepe ſtrong fortreſſes, ſeke alwayes ſtout and hardy captay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to defend their walles: for otherwiſe it were better the fort ſhold be bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to the grounde, then it ſhould come into the power of the enemyes. By the compariſons aboue named, ther is no diſcreat man but doth vnderſtand to what end my penne doth write them: that is: to know to kepe, and proue, how that men which loue their children wel (adding this vnto it) haue great neade of good maiſters and gouernours, to teache and bring them vp. For whiles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> palme tre is but litle, a froſt doth eaſely deſtroy it. I meane whiles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> child is yonge if he haue no tutour: he is eaſely deceiued with the world. If the lord be wiſe, and of vnderſtanding, there is no fortreſſe ſo eſteamed, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhip ſo fayre, nor herd ſo profitable, nor vyne ſo fruitful, but that he bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtemeth to haue a good ſonne then al theſe thinges together, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing in the world. For the father ought to loue his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as his owne proper: and al reſidue as giftes of fortune. If it be ſo (as it is in deade) ſince that for to keape and watche the herd they ſeake a good ſhepherde, if for the vine they ſeake a good labourer, if for to gouerne the ſhippe they ſeke a good
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:21411:169"/>
maiſter, and for to defend a fort they ſeke a good captayne: why then wil not the wiſe fathers ſeke for good maiſters, to teach &amp; bring vp their chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? O princes and great lords, I haue now told you, and agayne do ſay, that if you trauaile one yeare to leaue your chyldren goodes: you ought to ſweate 50 yeres to leaue them wel brought vp. For it auayleth lytle to carye much corne to the myl: if the myl be out of frame. I meane that in vayne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and treaſurs are gathered: when the child that ſhal inherite them, hath not witte to vſe them. It is no ſmal matter to know how to chooſe good gouernours. For the prince is ſage, that fyndeth ſuch a one: and much more happie is he, that of him ſhal be taught. For in my opinyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is no ſmal charg for one man to bring vp a Prince that ſhal gouerne manye. As <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth, the wiſe man ought to conferre al thinges with his frend, but firſt he ought to know who he is that is his frend. I meane, that the wiſe father oughte for his children to ſeke one good maiſter, and to him he ſhould recommende them al: but firſt he ought to know what he is. For that man is very ſimple which wil bye a horſe, before he ſe &amp; proue him, whether he be hole or lame. He ought to haue many and good condicions and qualyties, that ſhoulde bring vp the children of princes and great lordes: for by one way they nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe the tender trees in the orchard, &amp; after another ſort they plant the wild trees in the mountaynes. Therfore the caſe ſhalbe this, that we wil declare here what condicions, and behauiours the maiſters and gouernours of noble mens ſonnes ought to haue, which may bring them to honour, and their diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>doundeth to the honour and praiſe of his mayſter.</p>
                     <p>The firſt condicion is, that he which ought to be tutor to noble mens ſon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, ſhold be no leſſe then 40. yeres of age, &amp; no more then 60 bicauſe the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is yong, is aſhamed to comaund, &amp; if he be aged he is not able to correct.</p>
                     <p>The .2. it is neceſſary that tutors be very honeſt, &amp; that not only in purenes of conſcience: but alſo in the outward apparance, and cleanes of lyfe. For it is vnpoſſible that the child be honeſt, if the mayſter be diſſolute,</p>
                     <p>The 3. it is neceſſary that tutors and gouernours of princes and great lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, be true men, not only in their words: but alſo in their couenauntes. For to ſay the truth, that mouth which is alwaies ful of lyes, ought not by reaſon to be a teacher of the truth.</p>
                     <p>The 4. condicion, it is neceſſary y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gouernours of princes &amp; great lordes (of their owne nature) be liberall: for oft tymes the greate couetouſnes of maiſters, maketh the harts of princes to be gredy and couetous.</p>
                     <p>The 5. it is neceſſary that the maiſters and gouernours of princes, &amp; great lords, be moderate in wordes &amp; very reſolute in ſentences: ſo that they ought to teach the children to ſpeake litle, &amp; to harken much. For it is the chefeſt vertue in a prince, to heare with pacience, and to ſpeake wyth wiſedome.</p>
                     <p>The 6. condicion is, it is neceſſary that the mayſters and gouernours of princes and great lords be wiſe men, and temperate: ſo that the grauitye of the mayſter, maye reſtrayne the lyghtnes of the Schollers, for there is no greater plagues in Realmes, then for princes to be yong, and their maiſters to be lyght.</p>
                     <p>The 7. it is neceſſarye that the maiſters and tutors of princes and greate
<pb facs="tcp:21411:170"/>
lords, be wel learned in diuinity, and humanitie, in ſuch ſort that that which they teach the princes by word, they may ſhew it by writing, to the end that other princes may execute and put the ſame in vre: for mens harts are ſoner moued by the examples of thoſe which are paſt, then by the words of them that are preſent.</p>
                     <p>The 8. condicion, it is neceſſarie that the maiſters and tutors of princes be not giuen to the vice of the fleſh: for as they are yong, and naturallye giuen to the fleſh, ſo they haue no ſtrength to abide chaſt, neyther wiſedome to be ware of the ſnares. Therefore it is neceſſarye that theyr maiſters be pure and honeſte: for the Dyſcyples ſhall neuer bee chaſte, if the mayſter bee vicyous.</p>
                     <p>The 9. it is neceſſary that the maſters and tutors of Princes, and greate lords, haue good condicions, bycauſe the children of noble men (being dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely brought vp) alwayes learne euill condicions, the which their maiſters ought to reforme, more by good conuerſacion, then by ſharpe correction. For oftentimes it chaunceth, that whereas the maiſter is cruel, the ſcholer is not merciful.</p>
                     <p>The .10. it is neceſſary that the maiſters and tutors of prynces, and great lordes, haue not only ſene and red many things: but alſo that they haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued chaungeable fortune. For ſince noble mens ſonnes (by the gift of god) haue great eſtates, they ought therefore to prouide to ſpeake to many, to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to many, and to entreat with many, and it is very profitable for them to be conuerſaunt with expert men, for in the end, the approued ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel hath preheminence. I was willyng to bringe in theſe rules in my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to the end that fathers may kepe them in their memory, when they do ſeke mayſters to teach their children: for in my opinyon, the father is more in fault to ſeke an euil maiſter, then the maiſter is to make an euyl ſcholer. For if I chooſe euyl taylers to cut my gowne, it is my faulte that the cloth is loſt, and my gowne marred. Albeit the Romaines were in al their doings circumſpect, yet for this one thinge, I muſt enuy the good doctrine which they gaue to noble mens children. For wythout doubt, it is vnpoſſible that in any city there by a good common wealth, vnleſſe they are very circumſpect to bring vp yong children. <hi>Sabellicus</hi> in his rapſodies ſayth, that in the 415 ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res of the foundacion of Rome. <hi>Qintus Seruilius,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Geminus</hi> then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulles, being in the warre againſt the <hi>Volces</hi> the ſtout aduenturous captaine <hi>Camillus,</hi> there roſe a great ſtrife, and contencion in Rome amongeſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the knights: and that contencion was vpon the prouiſion of offyces. For in great common wealthes it hath bene an aunciente quarell, that in knights and gentlemen there ſurmounteth pride in commaundyng: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the people ther wanteth pacience in obeyinge.</p>
                     <p>The knightes and gentlemen would they ſhould choſe a <hi>Tribune Millitare</hi> in the ſenate, to ſpeake in the name of al the knyghtes, that were abſent and preſent: for they ſayd, that ſence they were alwayes at the warre, the whole common wealth remained in the power of the people. The commons on the other part importuned, and deſired, that a new officer ſhould be created, the whych ſhould haue the charge to examine and take accompt how the youth of Rome were brought vp: bycauſe the comon people did accuſe the knights,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:21411:170"/>
&amp; gentlemen, that the longer they remained in the warres, the more ſenſuallye their chyldren lyued in Rome. It was decreed then, that a <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune Millitare</hi> ſhould be erected, the which in aucthority and dignytie ſhould be equal with the ſenatours, &amp; that he ſhould repreſente the ſtate of warlike knights: but that office continued no longer then foure yeres in Rome (that is to wete) til the time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Camillus</hi> retourned from the warres. For thinges that are grounded of no reaſon, of them ſelues they come to nought. Al the knights &amp; gentlemen ſought to the vttermoſt of their power, to maintaine their prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: &amp; on the other ſide al the cominalty of Rome was againſt it. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, the good captaine <hi>Camillus</hi> called al the knights &amp; gentlemen to gethers and ſayd vnto them theſe words. I am greatly aſhamed, to ſe that the ſtoutnes ſhould be ſo lytle of the Romaine knights, that they ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcend to the wil of the <hi>Plebians:</hi> for in dede the myghty do not get ſo much honour, to ouercome the lytle: as the litle do to ſtriue with the great. I ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſtrife &amp; debate amongeſt you in Rome, doth diſpleaſe me muche: therfore (you knights) if you wil not loſe your honours, you muſt eyther kil them, or ouercome them. You cannot ouercome them, bycauſe they are many: &amp; kyll them you ought not, for in the end they are youres, &amp; therfore ther is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remedy then to diſſemble with theym. For things which ſuffer no force, nor obſerue not iuſtyce, ought alwayes (vntil conuenient time) to be diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. The immortal gods did not create Romaine knights to gouerne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: but to conquere Realmes. And I ſay further, that they dyd not create vs to teach lawes to oures: but to giue lawes to ſtraungers. And if we be the children of our fathers, &amp; immitators of the auncient Romanes: we wil not content our ſelues to commaund in Rome, but to commaund thoſe which do commaund in Rome. For the hart of a true Romaine: doth lytle eſteame to ſe himſelfe lord of this world: if he know that ther is another to conquere. You others did creat this <hi>Tribune Millitare,</hi> we being in the warre: whereof now theris no neceſſitye, ſince we are in peace. And the cauſe whye I was willing ther ſhould be none in the common wealth, was for that ther was not riches in Rome ſufficient to acquite the deſarts of the Romaine chiualry. And if you eſteme, an honorable office, to be a <hi>Tribune Millitaire:</hi> ſince you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not al haue it, me thinketh you ſhold al want it. For amonge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble men &amp; <hi>Plebeians</hi> it is not mete, that one alone ſhould enioy that, which many haue deſerued. This hiſtory <hi>Sabellicus</hi> declareth, &amp; allegeth <hi>Pulio</hi> for his aucthor, &amp; reciteth, that for this good worke that <hi>Camillus</hi> did in Rome (that is to wete) to ſet the great &amp; the ſmal at one: he was aſwel beloued of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> romaines, as he was feared of the enemies. And not without a iuſt cauſe: for in my opinyon it is a greater vertue to pacify his owne, then to robbe ſtraungers. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the office of this <hi>Tribune,</hi> wherupon this great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tencion roſe in Rome I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tel which was greater, the foliſh raſhnes of the knights to procure it, or the wiſedom of <hi>Camillus</hi> to abboliſh it. For to ſay the truthe, the arte of cheualrie was inuented more to defend the common wealth: then to byde at home, &amp; haue the charge of iuſtice. For to the good knight it ſemeth better to be loden w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to reſiſt enemyes: then to be enuyroned with bokes to determyne cauſes. Returning therfore to that whych the people ſayd againſt the ſouldiors, it was ordayned (by the conſent of al) that in Rome an office
<pb facs="tcp:21411:171"/>
ſhould be erected, and that he which ſhould haue it, ſhould haue the charge to go through Rome, to ſe what they were in Rome, that did not inſtruct their children in good doctrine: and if perchaunce he found any neighbours child that was euyl taught, he chaſtiſed and baniſhed the father. And truly that puniſhment was very iuſt, for the father deſerueth more punyſhment, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he doth therunto conſent: then the child deſerueth more the offences which he doth comit. When Rome was Rome, &amp; that of al the world the common wealth therof was comended, they choſe for an officer therin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent &amp; vertuous Romaine, who was called the general vyſiter of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rome: &amp; it ſemeth to be true, for ſomuch as he whych had this office one yere, hoped to be conſul, dictatour. or cenſor the next. As it appeareth by <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Porcio,</hi> who deſired to be corrector of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; afterwards ſucceded to be cenſor of the Romaine people. For the Romaynes dyd not offer the office of iuſtice to any man, vnleſſe he had had experience of al offices. <hi>Patricius Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis</hi> in the booke of the common wealth ſaith, that before the warres were betwene <hi>Carthage</hi> &amp; Rome, the comon wealth of <hi>Carthage</hi> was very wel go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned, &amp; as it be ſemed ſuch a noble citie: but it is an auncient preuiledge of the warre, that it kylleth the perſones, conſumeth the goods, &amp; aboue al, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth a new paſſion &amp; miſerie: &amp; in the end deſtroyeth al good aunciente cuſtomes.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Carthagians</hi> therefore had a cuſtome, that the chyldren, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe which were of honeſt men, ſhould be put in the temples from iii. ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, tyl .xii. &amp; ſo from .xii. til xx. they learned crafts, ſciences, &amp; occupacions, and from .xx. vntil .xxv. they inſtructed them in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feates of warre: &amp; at the end of xxx. yeres they gaue themſelues to mariage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt them it was a law inuiolable, that no man ſhold mary vntil he were xxx. yeres of age: &amp; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men xxv. And after that they were maried, the moneth folowing they ought to preſent themſelues before the Senate, &amp; ther to choſe what kind of eſtate they would take vpon them to liue in, and what their minds moſt deſired (that is to wete) if they would ſerue in the Temples, folow the warre, or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle the ſeas, or get their lyuing by land, or follow their occupacion which they had learned. And loke what eſtate or office that day they choſe, the ſame they kept &amp; occupyed during their lyfe: &amp; truly the law was very good, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch chaunge of eſtates &amp; offices in the world, are occaſion that preſent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly ſo many come to deſtruction. Al the excellent and auncient Princes had many great philoſophers for their maſters: &amp; this ſeameth to be true by this, that kyng <hi>Darius</hi> had <hi>Lichanius</hi> the phyloſopher for his mayſter. The greate <hi>Alexander</hi> had <hi>Ariſtotel</hi> the phyloſopher for hys maſter. Kinge <hi>Artaxerces</hi> had <hi>Pindarus</hi> the phyloſopher for his mayſter. The aduenturous and hardye cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of the <hi>Athenians Palemo</hi> had <hi>Xenocrates</hi> the Phyloſopher for his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. <hi>Xemiades</hi> (only kyng of the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) had <hi>Chilo</hi> the phyloſopher for hys mayſter and tutour to hys chyldren.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Epamynundes,</hi> prince of the <hi>Thebaines,</hi> had for his maiſter and councelloure <hi>Maruchus</hi> the Phyloſopher.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vliſſes</hi> the Greke (as <hi>Homere</hi> ſayth) had for his mayſter and companyon in hys trauayles, <hi>Catinus</hi> the phyloſopher.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pirrus</hi> (whyche was kynge of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> and greate defendoure of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21411:171"/>
                        <hi>Tharentines</hi>) had for hys maiſter and chronicler, <hi>Arthemius</hi> the phyloſopher. Of whom <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>ad atticum,</hi> that his ſword was ſharper to fighte, then his penne ready to write. The great kyng <hi>Ptholomeus Philadelphus</hi> was not onely ſcholer of the moſt ſinguler Phyloſophers of Grece: but alſo after he was king, he ſent for 72. phyloſophers wych were <hi>Hebrues. Cirus</hi> kyng of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> that deſtroyed the great Babylon, had for his mayſter <hi>Priſticus</hi> the Phyloſopher. <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperour had <hi>Plutarche</hi> for hys mayſter, who dyd not only teach hym in hys youth: but alſo wrote him a booke, how he ought to gouerne hym ſelfe &amp; his common wealth. By theſe few examples which I haue expreſſed, and by many other whych I omit, Princes at this preſent may ſe, how carefull princes were in tymes paſt, to geue their chyldren wyſe and learned men, O prynces and great lordes, ſynce you that are at thys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, do preſume and take vppon you that whyche your forefathers dyd: I would that now you would conſyder, who brought them to ſo high eſtate, and who leaueth of them eternal memory. For wythout doubt noble men neuer wanne renowme, for the pleaſures they had in vyces, but for the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes they had in vertues. Againe I ſay, that princes in tymes paſt were not famous for theyr ſtoutnes, and apt dyſpoſicion of theyr bodyes, neyther for diſcent of hygh and noble lynage, nor yet for the poſſeſſion of many real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: or heaping vp of great treaſours: but they wanne &amp; obtayned immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal renowme, for that their fathers in theyr youth put them vnder the tuicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wiſe and learned tutours, whych taught them good doctrine, &amp; when they were of age gaue them good counſaylers to gouerne the common wealth. <hi>Laertius</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyfe of the phyloſophers, &amp; <hi>Boccaſe</hi> in the boke of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lynage of gods ſay, That among the phyloſophers of <hi>Athens</hi> there was a cuſtome, that no ſtraung phyloſopher ſhould reade in their ſcholes, before he weare firſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myned in natural and moral phyloſophy: for amonge the Grekes it was an auncyent prouerbe, that in the ſchole of <hi>Athens</hi> no vycious man could enter, nor idle word be ſpoken, neither they dyd conſent that any ignoraunt philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſhould come in to read there. As by chaunce many phyloſophers were come from the mout <hi>Olimpus,</hi> amongeſt the reſidue ther was one came to ſe the phyloſophers of <hi>Athens,</hi> who was natife of <hi>Thebes,</hi> a man (as afterwards he declared him ſelfe) in mortal &amp; natural Phyloſophy very wel learned: and ſince he deſired to remayne in <hi>Athens,</hi> he was examined, and of many and dyuers thyngs demaunded. And amongeſt the others theſe folowing were ſome of them.</p>
                     <p>Firſte they aſked him, what cauſeth women to be ſo frowarde, ſince it is true that nature made them ſhamefaſt, and created them ſimple? the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher aunſwered. A Woman is not frowarde, but bycauſe ſhe hath to much her wil, and wanteth ſhame.</p>
                     <p>Secondarily they aſked him why yong men are vndone? he aunſwered: bycauſe time aboundeth them for to do euil, and mayſters wanteth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to do good.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly they aſked him, why are wiſe men deceyued aſwel as the ſimple? he aunſwered. The wiſe man is neuer deceyued, but by him that vſeth faire words. and hath euil condicions.</p>
                     <p>Forthly they aſked him, of whom me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought moſt to beware? he aunſwered
<pb facs="tcp:21411:172"/>
That ther is to a man no greater enemye, then he which ſeeth that thing in the, which he deſireth to haue in him ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly they aſked him, why many princes beginne wel and end euil? he aunſwered: princes begin wel, bycauſe their nature is good: &amp; they end euil, bycauſe no man doth gaine ſay them.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly they aſked him, why do princes comit ſuch follyes? he aunſwered: Bicauſe flatterers aboundeth that deceiue them: &amp; true men wanteth which ſhould ſerue them.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly they aſked him, why the auncients were ſo ſage, &amp; men at thys preſent ſo ſimple? he aunſwered. Bycauſe the auncients did not procure but to know, &amp; they preſent do not trauaile but for to haue.</p>
                     <p>Eightly they aſked him, why ſo many vyces were nouriſhed in the pallace of princes? he aunſwered. Bycauſe pleaſures abound, and councel wanteth. The ninth, they aſked him, why the moſt part of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liued without reſt, &amp; few without paine? he aunſwered. No man is more without, &amp; ſuffereth more paine: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he which dieth for the goods of another, &amp; litle eſtemeth his owne.</p>
                     <p>The tenth they aſked him wherby they myght know the common wealth to be vndone: he aunſwered. There is no comon wealth vndone, but where the yong are light, and the old vicious.</p>
                     <p>The xi. they aſked him wherwith the comon wealth is mainteyned? he aun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwered. The common wealth cannot decay, wher iuſtice remayneth for the poore, puniſhment for the tiraunts, weight and meaſure plentiful: &amp; chefely, if ther be good doctrine for the yong, &amp; lytle couetouſnes in the old. <hi>Affro</hi> the hiſtoriographers declareth this in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> x boke <hi>De rebus atthenienſium.</hi> Truly in my opinion the words of this philoſopher were few, but the ſentences were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And for none other cauſe I dyd bring in this hiſtory, but to profite me of the laſt word, wherin for aunſwere he ſaith, that al the profite of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth conſiſteth, in that ther be princes that reſtrayne the auarice of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: &amp; that there be maiſters to teach the youthful. We ſe by experience, that if the brute beaſts were not tied, &amp; the corne &amp; ſeedes compaſſed with hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or ditches, a man ſhould neuer gather the fruite when they are ripe. I meane, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtrife &amp; debate wil riſe continually amonge the people, if the yonge men haue not good fathers to correct them, &amp; wiſe maiſters to teach them We ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny, but though the knife be made of fyne ſteele, yet ſometimes it hath nede to be whet: &amp; ſo in lyke maner the yong man, during the time of his youth, though he do not deſerue it, yet from time to time he ought to be corrected. O princes &amp; great lords, I know not of whom you take councell when your ſonne is borne, to prouyde him of a maiſter &amp; gouernour, whom you choſe not as the moſt vertuous, but as the moſt richeſt: not as the moſt ſageſt, but as the moſt vile &amp; euil taught. Finally, you do not truſt him wyth your children that beſt deſerueth it: but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> moſt procureth it. Againe I ſay, O princes &amp; great lords, why do you not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>draw your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from their hands which haue their eyes more to their owne profite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their harts vnto your ſeruice. For ſuch to enrich themſelues, do bring vp princes vyciouſly. Let not princes thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a trifle to know, how to find &amp; choſe a good maſter: &amp; the lord which herein doth not employ his dyligence, is worthy of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, And becauſe they ſhal not pretend ignoraunce, let them beware of that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21411:172"/>
man whoſe life is ſuſpicious, and extreame couetous. In my opinion, in the palace of princes the office of tutorſhip ought not to begeuen as other comon offices, that is to wete, by requeſtes or money, by priuyties or importunities, eyther els for recompence of ſeruices: for it foloweth not though a man hath ben imbaſſadour in ſtraunge realmes, or captaine of great armies in warre, or that he hath poſſeſſed in the roial palace offices of honour, or of eſtemacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that therfore he ſhould be able to teach, or bring vp their children. For to be a good captayne, ſufficeth only to be hardy, and fortunate: but for to be a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and gouernour of princes, he ought to be both ſage, and vertuous.</p>

                        <hi>MArcus Aurelius</hi> the xvii. Emperour of Rome, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time that he was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> only doughter of the Emperour <hi>Antonius Pius,</hi> had only ii. ſonnes, wherof the eldeſt was <hi>Comodus</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Veriſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Of theſe ii. chyldren the heyre was <hi>Comodus,</hi> who was ſo wycked in the 13 yeres he gouerned the empire: that he ſemed rather the diſciple of <hi>Nero</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruel, then to deſcend by the mothers ſyde: from <hi>Anthonius</hi> the mercifull, or ſonne of <hi>Marcus Aurelius.</hi> This wicked chyld <hi>Comodus</hi> was ſo light in ſpeach, ſo diſhoneſt in parſon, &amp; ſo cruel with his people: that oft tymes (he being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue) they layed wagers that ther was not one vertue in him to be found, nor any one vyce in him that wanted. On the contrary part the ſecond ſonne na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med <hi>Veriſſimus,</hi> was comely of geſture, proper of perſonne, &amp; in witte verye temperate: &amp; the moſt of al was, that by his good conuerſacion of al he was beloued. For the faire and vertuous princes by theyr beauty draweth vnto them mens eyes: &amp; by their good conuerſacion they winne their harts. The child <hi>Veriſſimus</hi> was the hope of the comon people, &amp; the glory of his aged fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo that the Emperour determined y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this chyld <hi>Veriſſimus</hi> ſhold be heyre of the Empire, and that the prince <hi>Comodus</hi> ſhould be diſherited. Wherat no man ought to maruaile, for it is but iuſt ſince the child doth not amend hys lyfe: that the father do diſinherit him. When good wil doth want, and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleaſures abounde: the children oft times by peruerſe fortune come to nought. So this <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> being .52. yeres old, by chaunce this chylde <hi>Veriſſimus</hi> (which was the glory of Rome, &amp; the hope of the father) at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gate of <hi>Hoſtia,</hi> of a ſodayne ſicknes dyed. The death of whom was as vniuerſallye lamented: as his lyfe of al men was deſired. It was a pitiful thynge to ſee, how wofully the father toke the death of his intierly beloued ſon: &amp; no leſſe lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table to behold how the ſenat toke the death of their prince, beinge the heire. For the aged father for ſorow did not go to the Senate: and the ſenat for few daies encloſed themſelues in the high Capitol. And let no man mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, though the death of this yong prince was ſo taken through Rome: For if men knew what they loſe when they loſe a vertuous Prince, they would neuer ceaſe to bewaile and lament hys death. When a knight, a gentleman a ſquyre, an offycer, or when any of the people dyeth, ther dyeth but one: but when a prince dieth, which was good for all, and that he lyued to the profit
<pb facs="tcp:21411:173"/>
of al, then they ought to make account that al do dye, &amp; they ought al great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to lament it. For oft times it chaunſeth, that after ii. or iii. good Princes, a foule flocke of tyraunts ſuccedeth. Therfore <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the Emperour, as a man of great vnderſtanding, and of a princely parſonne, though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſorow from the rootes of the hart could not be plucked: yet he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to diſſemble outwardly, and to burie his greues inwardly.</p>
                     <p>For to ſay the truth, none ought (for any thing) to ſhew extreame ſorow: vnleſſe it be that he hath loſt his honour, or that his conſcience is burdened. The good prince as one that hath his vineyard froſen, wherin was al hys hope, contented with him ſelfe with that whych remaineth, his ſo derely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued ſonne being dead: &amp; comaunded the prince <hi>Comodus</hi> to be brought into his pallace, being his only heyre. <hi>Iulius Capitolinus,</hi> whych was one of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wrote of the tyme of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſayd vpon this matter, that when the father ſaw the diſordinate fraylenes, and lightnes, and alſo the litle ſhame whych the prince <hi>Comodus</hi> his ſonne brought with him: the aged man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to weape, and ſhed teares from his eyes. And it was, bycauſe the ſymplenes and vertues of his deare beloued ſonne <hi>Veriſſimus</hi> came into hys mynd. Though this Emperour <hi>Marcus,</hi> for the death of hys ſonne was very ſorowful: yet notwithſtanding this he prouided, how his other ſonne <hi>Como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> ſhould be gouerned, &amp; this before that eyther of age or body he wer grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny, but when Princes are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they wil be ſuch as in their youth they haue bene brought vp. The good father therfore knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the euil inclinacions of his ſonne ſhould do him domage, &amp; the empire in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: he ſent throughout al Italy, for the moſt ſageſt &amp; expert men, to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours &amp; Tutors of <hi>Comodus</hi> the prince. He made them ſeke for the moſt profoundeſt in learning, the moſt renowmed of good fame, the moſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in dedes, and the moſt depeſt in vnderſtandyng: for as the duſt is not ſwept with fyne cloth, but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> dry bromes: ſo the lightnes &amp; follies of yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not remedied, but by the hard diſciplyne of the aged. Thys commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being publiſhed and proclaimed in Rome, &amp; the bruit ſcattered through Italye, there came and ranne thither dyuerſe kinde of ſages, whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be examyned. He being informed of the bloud of thier prediceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, of the age of their perſones, of the gouernment of their houſes, of the ſpendyng of their goodes, of their credit amongeſt their neighbours, of the ſciences they knew, &amp; aboue al, they were no leſſe examined of the purenes of their lyues, then of the grauitie of their perſonnes: for ther are many men whych are graue in open wordes, &amp; very light in ſecret works. Speakyng therfore more particularly, he commaunded they ſhould examyne the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers of Aſtronomy, the phyloſophers in philoſophie, the muſitines in mu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſike: the Orators in oracions. And ſo forth of other ſciences in order, wherin euery one ſayd he was inſtructed. The good emperour was not ſo conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do this once but ſondry times, not al in one day, but in many, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by an other man, but alſo by him ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Finally they were al examyned, as if they had bene al one, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame one ſhold haue remayned &amp; bene kept for al, to be only maſter &amp; tutor of the young child and prince <hi>Comodus.</hi> To acquire a perfect knowledge, and to be

ſure not to erre in choyce of thinges, in my opinion is not onely required ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of him ſelfe, and a cleare vnderſtanding: but alſo the aduyſe of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the knowledge of thinges wholly together is eaſy: but the choyce of them particularly is harde. This thing is ſpoken becauſe the good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſent, and commaunded to choſe gouernours and maiſters of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Of many he chooſe fewe, and of fewe the moſt wyſeſt, of the moſt wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt the moſt expert, of the moſt expert the beſt learned, of the beſt learned the moſt temperate, of the moſt temperate the moſt auncient, and of the moſt auncient the moſte noble. Certainely ſuch election is worthy prayſe, becauſe they be true maiſters and teachers of princes, which are noble of bloud, aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in yeares, honeſte in life, men of litle folly, and of great experience. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſeuen liberal ſciences, two maiſters of euery one were choſen, ſo that the prince was but one, and the others were .xiiii. but this notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the workes of this prince <hi>Comodus</hi> were contrary to the expectation of his father <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> becauſe the intention of the good father was to teache his ſonne all ſciences: and the ſtudy of the ſonne was to learne all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. At the bruite of ſo great a thing as this was, that the Emperour ſought to prouide tutors for the prince <hi>Comodus,</hi> and that they ſhould not be thoſe which were beſt fauoured, but thoſe whiche were found the moſt wyſeſt: in ſhorte ſpace there came ſo many philoſophers to Rome, as if the deuine <hi>Plato</hi> had bene reuiued againe in Grece. Let vs not marueile at all, if the ſages de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the acquaintaunce &amp; familiaritie of this good Emperour. For in the ende, there is no man ſo ſage, nor ſo vertuous in this life, but ſometime wyll ſeke after the fauours of the world. Since there were many ſages, and that of thoſe he choſe but fourtene. It was neceſſary he ſhould honeſtly and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſely diſpatche and geue the others leaue, as did behoue him. And herein the good emperour ſhewed him ſelfe ſo wyſe, that ſhewing to ſome a mery cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce, to others ſpeaking gently, and to others by a certaine hope, &amp; to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by giftes &amp; preſentes, al the good company of the ſages departed: &amp; the good emperour diſpatched them, not one being ſad which departed, but very wel pleaſed. For it is not comely for the magnificence of a prince, that the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to his pallace only for his ſeruice, ſhould returne murmuring, or without rewarde. This good emperour ſhewed him ſelfe ſage to ſeke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſages, he ſhewed him ſelf wiſe in the choice of ſome, &amp; of a good vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in diſpatching others, &amp; in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all. For as we ſee daily by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, though the elections be good, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly great affections thereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender. For thoſe, for not being choſen are ſory, &amp; to ſee the others choſen are ſhamefaſt. In ſuch caſe likewyſe, let it not be eſteamed litle to ſerche a good remedy. For the goldſmith ofttymes demaundeth more for the workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then the ſiluer is worth: I meane, that ſomtime princes do deſerue more honour for the good meanes they vſe in their affaires: then for the good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe whereunto it commeth. For the one aduenture guideth, but the other wiſedome aduaunceth. The good emperour not contented with this, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that thoſe .xiiii. philoſophers whiche ſhould remaine in his pallace, ſhould ſitte at the table, and accompany his perſone: the which thing he did, to ſee if their life wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formable to their doctrine, &amp; if their words did agree to their works. For ther are many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ar of a goodly to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gue, &amp; of a wicked life.

                        <hi>Iulius Capitolinus,</hi> and <hi>Cinna Catullus,</hi> whiche were writers of this hiſtory ſay, that it was a wonder to ſee howe this good Emperour did marke them, to know if they were ſober in feading, temperate in drinking, modeſt in going, occupied in ſtudieng, and aboue all if they were very ſage in ſpeakynge, and honeſt in liuing. Would to God the princes of our tyme were in this caſe ſo diligent, and carefull: and that in committing in truſte their affaires, they would not care more for one then for others. For ſpeaking with due reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, there aboundeth no wyſedome in that prince, whiche committeth a thing of importaunce to that man whom he knoweth not, whether he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to brynge it to paſſe or not. Many talke euill, and maruaile that princes and great lordes in ſo many thinges doe erre: and for the contrary I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile howe they hitte any at al. For if they committed their waightie affaires to ſkilfull men, though perhappes they erre once: yet they hitte it a hundred times, but when they committe their buſines to ignoraunt men, if they hitte once, they miſſe a thouſand times againe. In this caſe I ſay, there is nothing deſtroyeth younge Princes more, then for that they committe not their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires to their olde and faithfull ſeruauntes: For in fine the vnfained loue is not, but in him that eateth the princes bread daily. It is but reaſon, that other princes take example by this prince to ſeke good maiſters for their children: and if the maiſters be good, and the ſchollers euyll, then the fathers are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleſſe. For to princes and great lordes, it a great diſcharge of conſcience, to ſee though their children be loſte: yet it is not for want of doctrine, but for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundaunce of malice. The Romaine prince had a cuſtome to celebrate the feaſte of the God <hi>Genius,</hi> who was God of their byrthe, and that feaſte was celebrated euery yeare once, whiche was kepte the ſame daye of the byrth of the Emperour, ioyfully throughout all Rome: for at this day al the pryſoners were pardoned, and deliuered out of the pryſon <hi>Mamortina.</hi> Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding you ought to knowe, that if any had ſowed ſedition amonge the people, or had betrayed the armies, or robbed or done any miſchiefe in their temples: thoſe three offences were neuer pardoned nor excuſed in Rome. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as in Chriſtian religion the greateſt othe is to ſweare by God, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt the Romaines there was no greater othe, then to ſweare by the God <hi>Genius.</hi> And ſince it was the greateſt othe none could ſweare it, but by the licence of the Senate: and that ought to be, betwixt the handes of the prieſtes of the God <hi>Genius.</hi> And if perchaunce ſuche an othe were taken of light occaſion, he which ſware it was in daunger of his life. For in Rome it was an auncient lawe, that no man ſhould make any ſolempne othe, but that firſt they ſhould demaunde licence of the Senate. The Romaines did not permitte, that lyers nor diſceiuers ſhould be credited by their othes: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they permitte them to ſweare. For they ſaid, that periured men doe both blaſpheme the Gods and deceiue men. The aboue named <hi>Marcus Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> was borne the .xxvii. day of Aprill, in Mounte <hi>Celio,</hi> in Rome. And as by chaunce they celebrated the feaſte of the God <hi>Genius,</hi> which was the daye of his birth, there came maiſters offence, Iuglers, and common players, with other loyterers, to walke and ſolace them ſelues. For the Romaines in their greate feaſtes, occupied them ſelues al night in offring ſacrifices to the gods, and afterwardes they conſumed all the day in paſtimes. Thoſe iuglers and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21411:174"/>
players, ſhewed ſo muche paſtime, that all thoſe which behelde them were prouoked to laughe, and the Romaines (to ſay the truth, were ſo earneſt in matters of paſtime, and alſo in other matters of weight that in the daye of paſtimes no man was ſadde, and in the time appointed for ſadnes no man was mery. So that in publike affaires they vſed all to mourne, or els all to reioyce. <hi>Cinna Catullus</hi> ſaith, that this good Emperour was ſo wel beloued, that when he reioyced, all reioyced: and when the Romaine people made any great feaſt, he him ſelfe was there preſent, to make it of more authoritie, and ſhewed ſuch mirth therein, as if he alone and none other had reioyced. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyſe if the prince loke ſadly, no man dare ſhewe him ſelfe mery. The hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographers ſay of this good emperour, that in ioyfull feaſtes and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes they neuer ſaw him leſſe mery, then was requiſite for the feaſt: nor they euer ſawe him ſo mery, that it exceaded the grauitie of his perſone. For the prince whiche in vertue preſumeth to be excellent, ought neither in earneſt matters to be heauy: nor in thinges of ſmall importaunce to ſhewe him ſelf light. As princes nowe a daies goe enuironned with menne of armes: ſo did then the good Emperour go accompanied with ſage philoſophers. Yea and more then that, which ought moſt to be noted, is that in the dayes of feaſtes &amp; pleaſures, the princes at this preſent goe accompanied with hongry flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: but this noble Emperour went accompanied with wiſe men. For the prince that vſeth him ſelfe with good company, ſhall alwayes auoyde the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil talke of the people. <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſaith, that a Senatour called <hi>Fabius Patroclus,</hi> ſeing that the Emperour <hi>Marcus</hi> went alwaies to the Senate and Theaters, accompanied and enuironned with ſages: ſaide one daye to him merily. I pray thee (my lorde) tell me, why thou goeſt not to the Theater, as to the Theater, &amp; to the Senate, as to the Senate. For to the Senate Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ought to go to geue vs good councell: and to the Theaters, fooles to make vs paſtime. To this the good Emperour aunſwered: my frend, I ſaye thou art much deceaued. For to the ſacred Senate, wherein there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſages, I would leade all the fooles to the ende they might become wiſe: and to the Theaters where all the fooles are, I would bring the ſages, to the ende to teache them wiſedome. Truly this ſentence was fit for him that ſpake it. I admoniſhe princes and great lordes, that in ſteade to kepe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with fooles, flatterers, &amp; paraſites, they prouide to haue about them wyſe and ſage me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in eſpecially if the fooles be malicious: for the noble hartes with one malicious worde are more offended: then if they were with a venemous arrow wounded. Therfore returning to our matter, as the emperour was in the feaſt of the god <hi>Genius,</hi> &amp; that with him alſo were the .xiiii. ſage philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, (maiſters of the prince <hi>Comodus</hi>) a iugler more conning then al the reſt, ſhewed ſondry trickes, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſuch vaine loiterers are wont to doe. For he that in like vanities ſheweth moſt paſtime, is of the people moſt beloued. As <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was ſage: ſo he ſet his eies more to beholde theſe .xiiii. mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, then he did ſtay at the lightnes of the fooles. And by chaunce he eſpied that fiue of thoſe laughed ſo inordinatly at the folly of theſe fooles, that they clapt their hands, they bet their feete, &amp; loſt the grauitie of ſages by their inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinat laughter: the which was a very vncomly thing in ſuch graue perſons. For the honeſt modeſtie of the body, is a great witnes of the wiſedome and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:175"/>
grauitie of the mynde. The lightnes and inconſtancie of the ſages ſene by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, and that al the graue Romaines were offended with them, he toke it heauely, as well to haue brought them thether: as to haue bene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in electing them. Howe be it with his wyſedom then he helped him ſelfe as muche as he coulde, in not manifeſting any griefe in his harte: but he deſſembled and made as though he ſawe them not. For ſage princes muſte nedes feale thinges as men, but they ought to diſſemble them as diſcrete. The Emperour preſently would not admoniſh them, nor before any reproue them, but he let the feaſte paſſe on, and alſo a fewe dayes after, the whiche being paſſed, the Emperour ſpake vnto them in ſecret, not telling them open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wherein he ſhewed him ſelfe a mercifull prince: for open correction is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſte, where ſecret admonition may take place. The thinges whiche <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſaide to thoſe fiue maiſters, when he put them out of his houſe, he him ſelfe did wryte in the third booke and the firſt chapter, vnder the title <hi>Ad ſtultos pedagogos.</hi> And ſaide that he ſaid vnto them theſe, and ſuche other like wordes.</p>

                     <p>MY will was not, my frendes, to forſee that whiche can not be excuſed, nor I wyll not commaunde you that, whiche I ought not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde: but I deſire that the gods of their grace doe remaine with me, and that with you the ſame iuſt gods may goe, and that likewyſe from me, and from you, the vnlucky and vnfortunate chaunces may be withdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen. For the vnlucky man were better be with the dead: then remayne here with the liuing. Since that nowe I had receiued you, and with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſought you, to that ende you ſhould be tutors to my ſonne (the prince <hi>Comodus</hi>) I proteſte to the immortall gods, that I am ſory, and that of your ſhame I am aſhamed, and that of your paine, the greateſt part is mine. And it can be no otherwyſe, for in the worlde there ſhoulde be no frendſhip ſo ſtreight, that a man therefore ſhoulde put his good name in daunger. The ſages that I haue ſought, were not prouided onely to learne the prince <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus:</hi> but alſo to refourme al thoſe that liued euill in my pallace. And nowe I ſee the contrary, for where I thought the fooles ſhould haue bene made wyſe, I ſee that thoſe that were wyſe, are become fooles. Knowe you not that the fine golde defendeth his purenes among the burning cooles? and that the man endued with wyſedome, ſheweth hym ſelfe wyſe, yea in the middeſt of many fooles? For truely as the golde in the fire is proued: ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the lightenes of fooles, is the wiſedome of the wyſe diſcerned. Do not you knowe, that the ſage is not knowen among the ſages, nor the foole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the fooles? but that amonge fooles wyſe men doe ſhyne, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the ſages fooles are darkened: for there the wyſe ſheweth his wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the foole ſheweth his folly. Doe not you knowe that in the ſore woundes, the ſurgian ſheweth his cunning, and that in the daungerous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, the phiſition ſheweth his ſcience? And that in the doubtful battailes the captaine ſheweth his ſtoutnes, and that in the boyſterous ſtormes, the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21411:175"/>
maiſter ſheweth his experience? So in like maner the ſage man, in that place where there is great ioye, and ſolace of people, ought to ſhewe his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diſcretion. Do not you know that of a moderate witte, there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceadeth a cleare vnderſtandinge, a ſharpe memory, a graue perſone, a quiet minde, a good name, and aboue all, a temperate tongue? For he only ought to be called wyſe, who is diſcreate in his workes, and reſolute in his wordes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doe not you knowe that it litle auaileth to haue the tongue experte, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory liuely, the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding cleare, to haue great ſcience, to haue profounde eloquence, a ſwete ſtyle, and ample experience, if with all theſe thinges you be as maiſters, and in your workes as wicked men? certainely it is a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour to a vertuous emperour, that he ſhould haue for maiſters of young princes, thoſe which are ſchollers of vaine Iuglers. Doe not you know, that if all the men of this worlde are bounde to leade a good life, that thoſe which preſume to haue ſcience, are muche more bounde then others are, whiche by their eloquence preſume to confounde the worlde? For it is a rule certayne, that alwayes euill workes take awaye the credit from good wordes. And to the ende it ſeame not vnto you that I ſpeake of fauour, I wyll brynge here into your memory an auncient lawe of Rome, the whiche was made in the tyme of <hi>Cinna,</hi> whiche ſaide: We ordeine and commaunde, that more greauous puniſhement be geuen vnto the ſage for one folly onely commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him openly: then to the ſimple man for a greater offence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly. O iuſte, &amp; very iuſt law: O iuſt, and happy Romaines, I ſaye vnto all thoſe that togethers did finde, &amp; ordeine the law. For the ſimple man ſleyeth but one man with his ſwerde of wrath: but the ſage killeth many by the euil example of his life. For (according to the ſaiyng of the deuine <hi>Plato</hi>) the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſage ſinne more by the euill examples whiche they geue: then in the faulte and offence that they committe. All the aunciente wryters affirme, that the triumphant Rome neuer began to decay, vntil the Senate was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with ſage ſerpentes, and deſtitute of ſimple doues. For in the ende there is nothing that ſoner deſtroyeth princes, then thinking to haue about them wyſe men, that ſhould counſell them: when in dede they are malitious, that ſeke to deceiue them. What a thing was in olde time, to ſee the pollicie of Rome, before that <hi>Sylla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> did alter it, before that <hi>Catilina</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi> did trouble it, before that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompeius</hi> ſclaundered it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> deſtroyed it, before that <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Caligula</hi> did defame it, and before that <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domician</hi> did corrupt it? For the moſt parte of theſe, though they were valiaunt &amp; wan many Realmes: yet notwithſtanding the vices whiche they brought vs, were more then the Realmes they wanne vs. And the worſt of all is, that al our kingdomes are loſte, and our vices abide ſtill. If <hi>Liuius</hi> and the other hiſtoriographers doe not deceiue vs, in olde time they might haue ſene in the ſacret Senate, ſome Romaines ſo auncient, with heeres ſo honorable, others ſo expert me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, others aged ſo modeſt, that it was a wonder to ſee the maieſtie they did repreſente, and a comforte to heare that which they ſayde. I ſpeake not that without teares whiche I wyll ſaye, that in ſteade of theſe auncient aged perſonnes, there ſprange vp other younge bablers, the whiche are ſuche, and ſo manye, that all the common wealth is altered, and Rome her ſelfe ſclaundered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:176"/>For that lande is curſed, and with muche miſerie compaſſed: where the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernaunce of the young is ſo euil, that al wyſhe for the reuiuing of the dead. If we credite that which the auncientes wrote, we cannot denay, but that Rome was the mother of all good woorke, as the auncient Grece was the beginner of al ſciences. So that the effect of the Grekes was to ſpeake, &amp; the glory of the Romaynes was to worke. But nowe, through our woful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenies, it is all contrary: for Grece hath baniſhed from it all the ſpeakers to Rome, and Rome hath baniſhed from it all the ſages to Grece. And if it be ſo (as it is in dede) I had rather be baniſhed to Grece with the ſages: then to take parte with Rome among the fooles. By the faithe of a Chriſtian I ſweare vnto you (my frendes) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I being young, ſawe an Oratour in Rome which was brought vp in the pallace of <hi>Adrian</hi> my Lorde, whoſe name was <hi>Ariſtonocus:</hi> of his body he was of meane ſtature, leane of face, &amp; alſo he was of an vnknowen countrey, but he had ſuch a pleaſaunt tongue, that though he had made an oration in the ſenate of three houres long, there was no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but willingly was deſirous to heare him. For in the old time, if he that made an Oration in the Senate were eloquent in his ſpeache, he was heard no leſſe, then if God <hi>Apollo</hi> had ſpoken him ſelfe. This philoſopher <hi>Ariſtonocus</hi> was on the one parte ſo gentle in his ſpeache, and on the other parte ſo diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in his life: that he neuer ſpake worde to the Senate, but it deſerued eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall memory: and out of that place they neuer ſawe him do good worke, but it merited greuous puniſhement. As I haue ſayed, though in that tyme I was young, yet I remember, that to ſee this philoſopher ſo loſte, all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did pitie, and the worſte of all was, that they neuer hoped of his amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince daily more and more he loſte his honour. For there is no man, that by his eloquence may haue ſuche renowme: but in the ende he may loſe it againe by his euil lyfe. Now I aſke you, my frends, ſithe you are in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ſages, which was better, or to ſaye better, whiche had bene leſſe enuied: that this philoſopher had bene a ſimple man, and of good life: then to be (as he was) a man of high eloquence, and of euill condition. It was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, if he had once heard of me that, whiche many times I haue hearde ſay of him, that he had not counſayled me, yea and futher to doe it he had conſtrained me, rather to choſe the graue, then to lyue in Rome with infamy. For he is vnworthy to lyue amongeſt men, whoſe wordes of all are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and his workes of all condemned. The firſte dictatour in Rome was <hi>Largius,</hi> and the firſt lordes of the knightes, was <hi>Spurius.</hi> And from the tyme of the firſt dictatour, vntill the time of <hi>Silla</hi> and <hi>Iulius</hi> (whiche were the firſt tyrauntes) were foure hundred, and fiftie yeares. In the whiche ſpace, we neuer redde that any Philoſopher ſpake any vayne wordes, nor yet commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any ſclaunderous deades. And if Rome had done any otherwyſe, it had bene vnworthy of ſuche prayſe and eſtimation as it had: for it is vnpoſſible that the people be well gouerned, if the Sages whiche gouerne them, are in their liues diſſolute. I proteſt to the immortall Gods, &amp; ſweare by the faithe of a Chriſtian, that when I conſider that whiche at this preſent with myne eyes I ſee: I can not but ſighe for that that is paſt, and wepe for that which is preſent. That is to wete, to ſee then howe the armies fought, to ſee howe the younge men trauayled to be good, to ſee howe well princes gouerned, to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21411:176"/>
ſe the obedience of the people. and aboue all, it was a merueilous thing to ſee the libertie and fauour whych the Sages had: and the ſubiection and ſmall eſtimation that the ſimple were in. And nowe by our euil fortune, we ſee the contrary in our woful time, ſo that I cannot tell, whither firſt I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the vertues and noblenes of them that are paſt, or the vices &amp; infamies of theſe whych are preſent. For we neauer ought to ceaſe from prayſinge the goodnes of the good: nor to ceaſe from reprouyng the wyckednes of the euill. O that I had bene in that glorious worlde, to ſe ſo honorable and auncient ſages, to gouerne in pleaſure: and for the contrary what grefe &amp; pytye, ſhame and diſhonor is it, to ſe now ſo many diſſolute ſages, and ſo many yong and buſy heades, the whych (as I haue ſayd) doe deſtroye all Rome, and ſlaunder all <hi>Italy,</hi> and diſhonor them ſelues. For the want of vertue whyche in them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth, endomageth the comon wealth: and the other vyces wherewith they are repleniſhed, corrupteth the people in ſuch ſorte, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weale publyke is more dyſhonored through the diſſolute life of them, then it is anoyed by the weapons of their enemies. I ſay agayn, and repete, my frendes that the proſperity of Rome endured .400. and .xv. yeres, in the whych time there was a great maieſtie of workes, and a marueilous ſimplicity of wordes, &amp; aboue all, that the beſt that it had was, that it was rich of the good and vertuous men, and poore of euill and vitious loyterers. For in the end that citie cannot be called proſperous, whych hath in it many people: but that which hath in it few vices. Speakyng therfore more perticulerly, the cauſe that moued me to put you from me is, bycauſe in the day of the great feaſt of god <hi>Genius,</hi> you ſhewed (in the preſence of the ſenate) your litle wiſedom, and great foly: for ſo much as all men did behold more y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lightnes of your parſon, then they did the follies of the iuglers. If perchaunce you ſhewed your folly, to thentent men ſhould thinke that you were familiar in my royal pallace, I tell you that the errour of your thought was no leſſe, then the euil and example of your work: for no man ought to be ſo familiar with princes, but (whether it be in ſporte or in earneſt) he ought to do him reuerence. Since I geue you leaue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte, I know you had rather haue to helpe you in your iorney a litle money, then many councelles: but I will geue you both, that is to wete: mony for to bring you to your iournies end, and alſo counſels to the end you may lyue. And meruail not that I geue counſel to them, that haue an office to councel others, for it chaunceth oftetimes that the phiſition do cure the diſeaſes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and yet in dede he knoweth not his owne. Let therfore the laſt word &amp; counſell be when you ſhalbe in the ſeruices of princes and great lordes, that firſt you labour to be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted honeſt, rather then wiſe. That they do choſe you rather for quiet men: then for buſy heades, and more for your fewe woordes, then for your much bablyng. For in the pallace of Princes, if the wiſe man be no more then wiſe, it is a great happe if he be moch eſtemed, but if he be an honeſt man, he is beloued and wel taken of all.</p>

                     <p>VVe haue before reherſed what conditions, what age, and what grauity maiſters ought to haue, which ſhould bring vp the children of Princes. Now reaſon would we ſhold declare, what the counſels ſhould be that

                     <p>For it is vnpoſſible ther ſhould happen any miſfortune: wher rype counſel is euer preſent. It ſhal ſeame vnto thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhal profoundly conſider this matter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a ſuperfluous thing to treate of theſe thinges: for either princes choſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good, or els they choſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euil. If they choſe not good maiſters, they labour in vaine to geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good counſel: for the foliſh maiſer is leſſe capable of cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dyſſolute ſcoler of holſome admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If perchaunce princes do make elections of good maiſters, then thoſe maiſters, both for them ſelues, and alſo for others ought to miniſter good counſels. For to geue councell to the wyſe man, it is either a ſuperfluous dede, or els it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of a preſumptuous man. Though it be true, that he whych dare geue councel to the ſage man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, I ſaye in lyke maner, that the dyamonde beyng ſet in gold loſeth not his vertue, but rather increſeth in pryce &amp; value: I meane, that the wiſer a man is, ſomuche the more he oughte to deſire to knowe the opinion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: certainly he that doeth ſo cannot erre. For to none his owne councell aboundeth ſomuch, but that he nedeth the counſell and opinion of another. Though princes and great lordes do ſe with their eyes, that they haue choſen good maiſters and tutors to teache their children: yet they ought not therfore to be ſo negligent of them ſelues, but that ſometimes they may geue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters counſell. For it maye be, that the mayſters be both noble, and ſtout, that they be auncient, ſage, &amp; moderate: but it may be alſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in teaching children they are not expert. For to maſters and tutours of princes, it is not ſomuche neceſſary that ſcience doth abounde, as it is ſhame that experience ſhoulde want. When a riche man letteth out his farme or maner to a farmor he doth not only conſider with him ſelfe before what rent he ſhall pay hym. but alſo he couenanteth with hym that he ſhall keape his groundes well fenſed and ditched, and his howſes well repaired. And not contented to receiue the thirde parte of the frute of his vine: but alſo he goeth twyſe or thriſe in a yeare to viſite it. And in ſeyng it he hath reaſon, for in the end the one occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyeth the goods as tenaunte: and the other doth viewe the grounde as chefe lord. Then if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father of the family with ſo great diligence doeth reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trees, and the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the labourer: how much more ought the father to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend his children to the maiſters? for the father geuing cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell to the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is no other: but to deliuer his child to the treaſurer of ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Princes and great lords ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not excuſe them ſelues of an offence, if after that they haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a knight, or gentleman for to be maiſter, or els a learned &amp; wiſe man to be tutour, they are ſo neclige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t as if they neuer had had children, or did remember that their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ought to be their heires: certainly this thing ſhold not be ſo lightly paſſed ouer, but as a wiſe man, (which is careful of the honor &amp; profit of his child) he ought to be occupied, aſwel in taking hede to the maiſter: as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiſter ought to be occupied, in taking hede to the child. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good fathers ought to know, whether the maiſter that he hath choſen can co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund, and whether his child wil obey. One of the notableſt princes among the auncien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes? was <hi>Sculeucus,</hi> king of the Aſſiria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and huſband of <hi>Eſtrabonica</hi> (the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21411:177"/>
of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> kyng of <hi>Macedony</hi>) a lady for her beauty in al <hi>Grece</hi> the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed, thoughe of her fame in dede ſhe was not very fortunat This is an olde diſeaſe, that hapneth alwayes to beautiful women, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther be many that deſire them, &amp; mo that ſlaunder them. This king <hi>Seuleucus</hi> was firſt maryed with another woman, of whom he had a ſonne called <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the whyche was in loue with the ſecond wife of his father, that is to wete, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quene <hi>Eſtrabonica,</hi> and was almoſt dead for loue. The whiche the father vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, maried his ſonne with her, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe that was his ſtepmother, was hys wife: and ſhe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was a faire wyfe, was a faire doughter, &amp; he which was hys ſonne, was made his ſonne in lawe, &amp; he which was father, was ſtepfather. The aucthor herof is <hi>Plutarke</hi> in his liues, as <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> ſaith, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> third boke of the ſayenges of the grekes. The king <hi>Seuleucus</hi> laboured diligently to bring vp his ſon <hi>Antigonus</hi> well, wherfore he ſought him .ii. notable maiſters, the one a greke, and the other a latine. The king <hi>Seuleucus</hi> here with not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, prouided ſecreatly (by the meane of a ſeruaunt of his, named <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi>) that he ſhold haue no other office in the pallace, but that what the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters taught or did to his ſonne <hi>Antigonus</hi> in the day, he ſhould ſecreatly come and tel him in the night. But by the dilligence of <hi>Parthemius,</hi> it came to the knowledge of the tutors that they had ouerſeers: for in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end ther is nothing accuſtomably, but at the laſt wil be reueiled. Since the, ii. philoſophers knew the ſecret, one day they ſayd vnto the king <hi>Seuleucus</hi> theſe wordes. Mightye prince <hi>Seuleucus,</hi> ſince thou haſt of truſt committed thy ſon <hi>Antigonus</hi> into our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, why doeſt thou appoint thy ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Parthemius</hi> as accuſer of our liues? if thou counteſt vs euil, and him good, thou ſhalt ſhowe vs great fauoure if thou wilt diſcharge vs, &amp; commit to hym the tuition of thy ſon. For we let the to know, that to men of honor it is an vntollerable euil to ſhame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and no diſhonor to licence them. Thou haſt appointed <hi>Parthemius</hi> to goe and dog vs, to ſee what we do, or ſay openly, and afterwardes to make relation vnto the ſecreatly: &amp; the worſt is, that by the relation of the ſymple, we ſhould be condemned beyng ſages: for triacle is not ſo contrary to poiſon: as ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is to wiſedom. And truly (moſt noble prince) it is a great matter, that dayly inquiſition be made of man: for there is no beard ſo bare ſhauen, but that it wil grow againe. I meane, that there is no man of ſo honeſt a lyfe: but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Conſyder my frendes, that I do know right well, that neither the aucthoritie of the parſon, nor the good creadite of renowme wold be ſteyned for any other frend in this world: &amp; if the rude men do it not, much leſſe ought the Sages to do it. For ther is nothing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men trauaile for ſomuch in this life, as to leaue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good renowme after their death. Since you are ſages, and maiſters of my ſonne, and likewyſe counſailers of my houſe, it is not mete you ſhold with any be offended: for by good reaſon he alone ought to be eſtemed in the pallaces of princes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil geue vnto the prince good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. That which I haue ſayed to <hi>Parthemius,</hi> was not for the doubt of your faith, neither to thinke any daunger in your aucthority. And if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing be wel conſidered, it goeth well for you, and not euil for me: and the reaſon herof is, that either you are good, or els you are euil. If you be good, you ought to be glad that daily your ſeruices be reported vnto me. For the continuall betyng
<pb facs="tcp:21411:178"/>
in the princes eares of the good ſeruices of his ſeruauntes: muſt nedes cauſe at the laſt their ſeruices to be well rewarded. Yf you be euill, and in teaching my ſonne negligent: it is but reaſon that I be aduertiſed. For if the father be deceiued in his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the ſon ſhall receiue poiſon in his doctrine, and alſo bycauſe you ſhal not vndoe my realme, nor ſlaunder me by your euil counſel. If the fatal deſtenies permit that my ſon be euill, I am he that loſeth moſt therby<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for my realme ſhalbe diſtroyed, and my renowme vtterly aboliſhed, &amp; in the end my ſonne ſhall not enioye the heritage. And if all paſſe ſo, you will care litel: for you wil ſaye you are not in the faulte, ſince the childe would not receiue your doctrine. Wherefore me thinke it not euill done to ouer ſee you, as you ouer ſee hym: for my dutye is to ſee that you be good, and your dutye is to trauaile that your diſciples be not euill.</p>
                     <p>This kynge <hi>Seuleucus</hi> was an honorable man, and dyed aged (as <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſayth, and <hi>Patroclus</hi> more plainely declareth, in the third boke of the warre of the <hi>Aſſirians</hi>) and for the contrarye hys ſonne <hi>Antigonus,</hi> came to be a wycked Prince in all his doynges.</p>
                     <p>And this a man may wel perceiue, that if he had not bene of his father ſo muche corrected, and of the maiſters ſo well inſtructed: without doubte he wold haue proued much more wicked then he was. For yong men on the on part beyng euill inclined, and on the other parte euill taught, it is vnpoſſible but that in the ende they ſhould be vitious, and defamed. In my opininion, though children be not euill inclined, yet the fathers therof ought not to ceaſe to correcte them: for in tyme to come thoſe that write, will commende the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the fathers in correcting the vices of the children. I haue declared this example, to councell that the father be not ſo necgligent, that he ſhoulde vtterly forget to loke vnto his ſonne, thinking that now the maiſter hath the charge of him. And of my concell, that father ought in this thing to be ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iſed, that if at the firſt he beheld the child with two eies: that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhuld loke vnto him with .iiii. eies. For oftetimes it is more requiſite that the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be puniſhed, then the ſcollers. Though princes are not daily informed of the life of the maiſters, as king <hi>Seuleucus</hi> was: yet at the leaſt oftetymes they ought to enquire of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtate, of the life, &amp; of the behauiour, both of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiſters, and alſo of the children. And this thing they ought not to do only once, but alſo they ought to cal the maiſters, and councel them lykwiſe that they haue great reſpect to the doctrine of their children: thinking alwayes to geue them good counſel, to ſhew vnto their ſcollers afterwardes. For otherwyſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter immediatly is diſcouraged, when he ſeeth the father to be necgligent, and nothing careful for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bringing vp of his children. Princes in one thing ought to haue great reſpect (that is to wete) leſt the maiſters beare with the ſecreat vyces of children. And he ought not to doe thus, but alſo to call them vnto hym, to aduyſe them, to warne them, to praye them, to counſell and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde them, that they haue great reſpect to the bringyng vp of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and further, that he geue them ſome notable councell, to thentente that the maiſters afterwarde maye make relation therof to their ſcollers. For there is no manne ſo weake, nor childe ſo tender: but the force whyche he hath to be vitious, is ynough (if he wil) to be vertuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would nowe demaunde the maiſters, and tutour, which do gouerne the children of noble and vertuous
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21411:178"/>
men, what more ſtrength is required to be a glutton, then to be a ſober man? to be a babler, or to be ſilent? to be dylygente, or to be necgligent? to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, then to be diſſolute? and as of thoſe few I ſpeake, ſo I coulde reſite ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye others. In this caſe I wyll not ſpeake as a man of ſcience, but as one of experience: and that is, that by the faith of a chriſtian I ſwere, that with leſſe trauaill of the maiſter, and more profyte of the ſcoller, he maye be ſoner vertuous then vitious. For there is more courage required, in one to be euil: then ſtrenght in another, for to be good. Alſo the maiſters commenly haue another euill property, worſe then this whyche is, they beare with their ſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in ſome ſecreat vices when they are yong: from the whiche they cannot be withdrawen afterwarde when they are olde. For it chaunceth oftetimes, that the good inclination is ouercome, by the euill cuſtome: and certainly the maiſters whych in ſuch a caſe ſhould be apprehended, ought to be puniſhed as traitors pariured. For to the mayſter it is greater treaſon, to leaue his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple amongeſt vices: then to delyuer a forte into the handes of the enemyes. And let no man maruaill, if I call ſuch a mayſter a treator, for the one yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the forte whych is but of ſtones builded: but the other aduentureth hys ſonne, who is of his proper body begotten. The cauſe of al this euill is, that as the children of Princes ought to enherite realmes, and the children of greate lordes hope to inherite the great eſtates: ſo the maiſters are more couetous then vertuous. For they ſuffer their puples to runne at their own willes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be yong, to thend to winne their hartes when they ſhalbe olde: ſo that the extreame couetouſnes of the maiſters now a dayes is ſuche, that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth goodmens ſonnes commonly to be euil and vitious. O tutors of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and maiſters of great lordes, I do admonyſhe you, and beſides that I counſell you that your couetouſnes deceiue you not, thynkynge that you ſhalbe better eſtemed for being clokers of vices: then louers of vertues.</p>
                     <p>For there is none (old nor yong) ſo wicked, but knoweth that good is better then euill. And further I ſay to you in this caſe, that oftetimes God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth (when thoſe that wer children become old) their eyes to be opened, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by they know the harme that you haue done them, in ſuffering them to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in thier youth: at what tyme your dutye had bene to haue corrected their vices. You thought by your goods to be honored for your flattery: but you find the contrary, that you are deſpiſed worthely. For it is the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of god, that he that committeth euill, ſhall not eſcape without punyſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and he that conſealeth the euill committed, ſhal not liue vndefamed. <hi>Diadumeus</hi> the Hiſtoriographer, in the lyfe of <hi>Seuerus</hi> the .xxi. Emperour) de clareth, that <hi>Apuleius Rufynus,</hi> who hadde ben conſull twiſe, and at that tyme was alſo tribune of the people (a man who was very aged and likewiſe of greate aucthoritie thoroughe oute Rome) came one daye to the Emperour <hi>Seuerus,</hi> and ſayed vnto him in this ſorte. Moſte inuicte Prince, alwayes <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> know that I had .ii. children the whiche I committed to a mayſter to bring vp, and by chaunce the eldeſt increaſinge in yeares, and diminiſhing in vertues, fell in loue with a Romaine ladye, the which loue came to late to my knowledge: for to ſuch vnfortunat men as I am, the diſeaſe is alwayes paſt remedy, before the daunger thereof commeth to our knowledge.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt grefe that herein I fele, is, that his mayſter knew and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſealed
<pb facs="tcp:21411:179"/>
the euill, and was not onely not a meanes to remedye it: but alſo was the chefe worker of the adultery betwene them to be committed. And my ſonne made hym an oblygation, wherin he bounde hym ſelfe if he woulde bryng hym that romaine lady, he would geue hym after my death, the houſe and herytages whych I haue in the gate <hi>Salaria:</hi> and yet herwith not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but he and my ſonne together robbed me of much money. For loue is coſtlye to hym that maynteineth it, and alwayes the loues of the children, are chargefull to the fathers. Iudge you now therefore noble Prince, thys ſo heinous and ſlaunderous cauſe, for it is to muche preſumption of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecte to reuenge any iniury, knowyng that the lorde hym ſelfe will reuenge all wronges. When the Emperour <hi>Seuerus</hi> hadde vnderſtode this ſo heynous a caſe, as one that was both in name and dede ſeuere, commaunded good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of the matter to be hadde, and that before his preſence the ſhoulde cauſe to appeare, the father, the ſonne, and the mayſter, to the ende eche one ſhould alledge for his owne right: for in Rome none could be condemned for anye offence, vnleſſe the plainetife had firſt declared the faulte before hys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and that the accuſed ſhold haue no tyme to make hys excuſe. The trueth then knowen and the offenders confeſſyng the offences, the Emperour <hi>Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> gaue iudgement thus. I commaunde that this mayſter be caſte alyue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the beaſtes of the parke <hi>Palatine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For it is but mete that beaſtes deuoure hym: whyche teacheth others to lyue lyke beaſtes. Alſo I doe commaunde that the ſonne be vtterly dyſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heryted of all the goodes of hys father, and banyſhed into the Iles <hi>Balleares,</hi> and <hi>Maiorques.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the chylde whiche from hys youth is vitious, oughte iuſtlye to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhed the countrey, and dyſherited of hys fathers goods.</p>
                     <p>This therfore (of the maiſter and of the ſonne) was done by the complaint of <hi>Apuleius. Rufinus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>O howe vnconſtant fortune is, and howe oft (not thynkyng of it) the threde of lyfe doth breake. I ſaye it, bicauſe if this maiſter had not bene coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, the father hadde not bene depriued of his ſonne, the childe hadde not bene baniſhed, the mother had not bene defamed, the common weale had not bene ſlaundered, the maſter, of wylde beaſtes hadde not bene deuoured, neyther the Emperour hadde bene ſo cruell agaynſt them, nor yet their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in Hyſtories (to their infamies) hadde alwayes continued.</p>
                     <p>I doe not ſpeake thys without a cauſe, to declare by writyng that whyche the euyll do in the world: For wyſe menne ought more to feare the infamye of the litle penne, then the ſlaunder of the bablyng tongue. For in the ende, the wicked tongue can not defame but the lyuynge: but the litle penne doth defame them that are, that were, and the ſhalbe. To conclude thys, my mynde is, that the mayſter ſhoulde endeuour hym ſelfe that hys ſcooller ſhoulde be vertuous, and that he doe not diſpayre, though immediately for hys paines he be not rewarded. For thoughe he be not of the creature, let hym be aſſured that he ſhalbe of the creatour. For God is ſo mercyefull, that he ofte tymes takynge pitie of the ſwette of thoſe that be good, chaſtneth the vnthankfull, and taketh vpon him to require their ſeruices.</p>

                     <head>Of the determination of the Emperour when he committed his childe to the tutours, whyche he had prouided for his education. Chapter. xxxviii.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Inna</hi> the Hyſtorien in the firſt booke of the times of <hi>Comodus</hi> declareth that <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the Emperour choſe .xiiii. maſters learned, and wiſe men, to teache hys ſonne <hi>Comodus,</hi> of the whyche he refuſed fyue, not for that they were not wyſe, but for that they were not honeſte. And ſo he kepte theſe nyne onely, whyche were both learned in the ſciences, and alſo experte in bringyng vp the chyldren of the Senatours, thoughe in dede they wer ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye vnlucky in the bryngyng vp of the Prince <hi>Comodus.</hi> For this curſed prynce had nyne maſters whych inſtructed him, but he hadde aboue nyne thouſand vyces whych vndyd him. The emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> made fyue bokes of declamations, and in the third booke the ſyxte Chapter, vnder the title <hi>ad Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientes pedagogos,</hi> he brought in theſe nyne mayſters, and perſwaded them greatly that they ſhould be diligent and attentyue to teach hys ſonne <hi>Como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi> And in this matter, he ſpake vnto them manye and graue ſentences, the wordes whereof doe folow.</p>
                     <p>The matter is manifeſt in Rome, and no leſſe publyſhed thorough out all Italy, what paynes I toke to ſearche oute to manye Sages to enſtructe my ſonne <hi>Comodus:</hi> the whiche all beyng examined, I kept onely the wyſeſt, and the beſt, and though in verye dede I haue done muche, yet I haue not done ſo muche as I am bounde.</p>
                     <p>For Prynces in doubtefull matters, ought not only to demaunde councel, of all the good that be alyue: but alſo to take payne to talke with thoſe which are dead. That is, to reade the dedes of the good in their writynges. You were fouretene mayſters choſen, whereof I haue put out fyue: ſo that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently you ar but nyne, and if in dede you be wyſe men, you ſhall not be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with that I haue done. For the greefe of euill thynges procedeth of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but the admiration of good thynges commeth of ſmall experience, I do not denay, but that wyſe men do fele in them paſſions as men: but in the end, there is no arte nor ſcience that doth excuſe vs from the miſeries of men. But that wher at I maruaile is, how it is poſſible that a wyſe man ſhoulde meruaile at any thyng in this world: For if the wiſe man ſhuld be aſtonied at euery thing of the world, it appeareth that ther is litle conſtancy or vertue in him at all. Returnyng therfore to our particular talke, I haue taken you to be maſters of my ſon, and you ſe, of many I choſe a few, to the end that with few my ſon ſhold be taught. For as it is the fathers dutie to ſearch out good maſters, ſo it is the maſters dutie to be diligent about his ſcoller. The nource of my ſonne <hi>Comodus</hi> gaue hym ſucke two yeres with her teates, at the gate of <hi>Hoſtia.</hi> And hys mother <hi>Fauſtine</hi> other two yeares brought him vp wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly in <hi>Capua.</hi> How be it thys was a ſufficient excuſe. I woulde as a pitie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full father (yf I coulde) geue hym correction at the leaſte thys twentye yeares. For I ſweare by the immortall Goddes, that to a Prynce that ſhalbe an enheritour, one yeares punyſhement is more worthe: then twenty yeares of pleaſure. Synce the nources whyche geueth the chyldren ſucke knoweth lytell, and ſynce the mothers whyche bare them doe loue them muche: and ſynce the chylde peraduenture (as yet) is but of a weake vnder
<pb facs="tcp:21411:180"/>
ſtandynge, they are occupyed about the thinges that are preſente, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge that chaſtyſemente in muche more betters for him, then pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>But the wiſe man whyche hath vnderſtandyng, oughte to thyncke of that that is paſt, and by much wyſedome to prouyde for that that is to come: For he can not be counted wiſe, that onely in one thing is carefull. My ſonne <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus</hi> was borne the laſte daye of <hi>Auguſte,</hi> in a citie by <hi>Danubio.</hi> I ſhall not forget the day that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods gaue him vnto me: nor yet this day in the whiche I commit hym vnto you. Of greater reaſon I ſhould remember that daye wherin I put him to be taught: then the day whych I ſaw him to be borne. For the gods gaue hym me, as I gaue hym to you mortall, ſince he is a man, but you ſhall reſtore him againe vnto me, and I lykewyſe him to the Godds as immortall, if he be wyſe. What will you I ſaye more vnto you, but if you regarde that any thinge at all whyche I ſaye, you will regarde much more thys whych I wyll ſaye. When the Gods determined that I ſhould haue a child of my wyfe, and that my wofull deſtenies deſerued, that I ſhould haue ſuch a child: truly the Gods made me a man in the ſprite, and I begot him a beaſt amongeſt the beaſtes in the fleſhe. But if you will, you may make hym a god amongeſt the gods by ſcience. For princes winne infamye, for beynge fearſe and ſelfe willed: but they get good renowme, for beyng wiſe and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. I would you ſhould apply this buſines well, and therfore it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye that you examine him ofte. For it is a general rule, that the precious iewel is litle regarded, when he whyche hath it knoweth not the value thereof. I require that you aunſwere me in this one thynge. What dyd I geue vnto my ſonne <hi>Comodus,</hi> when the gods gaue him me, but frayle and mortall fleſh? by the corruption wherof hys life ſhal ende: but you ſhal geue hym highe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, whereby he ſhall alwayes deſerue perpetuall memore. For the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme is not gotten, by that the weake fleſhe doth: but by that whyche the highe vnderſtandyng immagyneth, and by that the curious harte executeth. O if his tender age knew what I gaue to his weake fleſh, and if his dul vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding could com to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſedom which you may geue him: he wold call you his right fathers, &amp; me but his ſtepfather. For he is the true father that geueth vs doctrine to liue: and he is but an vniuſt ſtepfather, that geueth vs fleſhe to dye.</p>
                     <p>Certainely the naturall Fathers of children, are but their open enemyes, and cruell ſtepfathers: ſynce we geue them ſuch dul vnderſtanding, ſo weake a memory, a wyll ſo frowarde, lyfe ſo ſhorte, fleſhe ſo frayle, honour ſo coſtly, health ſo vncertaine, ryches ſo troubleſome, proſperitie ſo ſcarſe, and death ſo fearefull. Finally we geue them a nature ſubiecte, to infinite alterations, and great miſfortunes. Reaſon woulde not you ſhoulde lytle regarde that whiche I committe vnto your iudgement, that is to wete, that you haue the charge of <hi>Comodus</hi> my ſonne: For the thynge that Prynces chefely ought to foreſee, is to whome they oughte to recommende the gouernement of theyr children. To be a mayſter and Tutor of a Prince in the yearth, is to haue an office of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gods whyche are in heauen: bycauſe he gouerneth him that ought to gouerne vs, he teacheth him that ought to teache vs, he chaſtneth him that ought to chaſten vs. Finally he commaundeth one, that oughte to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde all. What wyll you that I ſaye more vnto you. Truly he that hath
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:21411:180"/>
the charge to teache the children of Prynces, and great Lordes, is as the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of the ſhyppe, a ſtandarde of a battaylle, a defence of the people, a guyde of the wayes, a father of the Orphanes, the hope of pupylles, and a treaſourer of all: For ther is no other true treaſore in the common wealthe but the prince whyche doth mainteine and kepe it in good peace, and iuſte iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. I will tell you furthermore, to the ende you ſhall eſteme it more, that when I doe geue you my ſonne to teache, I geue you more then if I gaue you all the ryches of the Realme. For in him that hath the reformacion of the childes life, dependeth the fame of the Father after he is deade.</p>
                     <p>So that the Father hathe no greater renowme: then to ſee hys chylde leade an honeſte lyfe. I praye the Gods that they maye be ſo mercyful, and the fatall deſtinies ſo fortunate, that if tyll thys time you haue watched to teache the children of others, that from hence forwarde you watche to tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thys my ſonne <hi>Comodus,</hi> whyche I truſte ſhalbe to the comforte of all.</p>
                     <p>For the thynge that is vniuerſally good to all, oughte to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that whyche tendeth but to the commoditie of ſome. You ſee my frendes, that there is a greate difference to teache the chyldren of Prynces, and to teache the children of the people: &amp; the cauſe hereof is, that the greateſt parte of thoſe come to the ſcooles and vniuerſities to learne to ſpeake, but I doe not geue you my ſonne <hi>Comodus,</hi> to the ende you ſhould teache hym to ſpeake many wordes, but that you ſhould learne him to do good workes.</p>
                     <p>For all the glorye of the Prynces is, that in the workes whyche he doth he be vprighte, and in the woordes that he ſpeaketh he be very diſcrete.</p>
                     <p>After that the children haue ſpente manye yeares in ſcooles, after their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue ſpente muche money vppon them, yf perchaunce the chylde can diſpute in Greeke or Latin anye thyng at all: thoughe he be lyghte and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the Father thynketh hys goodes well imployed: For in Rome, nowe a dayes, they eſteme an Oratour more, whyche can doe nought but bable: then a philoſopher whyche is vertuous. O wofull men, that now lyue in Rome, and muche more wofull ſhall thoſe be whyche hereafter ſhall ſuccede: For Rome is no more that Rome whyche it was wont to be, that is to wete, that the fathers in olde tyme ſente their children to ſcooles and ſtudies to learne them to be ſilent: and nowe they ſende them to learne to ſpeake to muche. They learned them then to be ſage and temperate: and nowe they learne them to be diſſolute. And the worſte of all is, that the ſcooles where the ſage and pacient were wont to be, and from whence iſſued the good and vertuous workes: are nowe full of bablynge Oratours, and none iſſue oute from thence at this preſent, but the euill and vitious. So that if the ſacred Romain lawes are exalted once in a weeke with their tongues: they are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken tenne tymes in the daye in their workes.</p>
                     <p>What will you I ſay more, ſince I can not tel you any thing (without hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my mother Rome) but that at this preſent al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleaſures of vain men, is to ſee their children ouercome others by diſputing: but I let you vnderſtand that all my glory ſhalbe, when my ſon ſhal ſurmount others, not in wordes, but in ſilence, not to be troubleſome, but to be pacient: not in ſpeakyng ſubtill wordes, but in doing vertuous workes. For the glorie of good menne is in workyng muche, and ſpeakyng littell. Conſider my frendes, and do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb facs="tcp:21411:181"/>
get it, that this daye I committe my honour vnto you, I put into your han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the eſtate of <hi>Comodus</hi> my ſonne, the glory of Rome, the reſt of the people which are my ſubiectes, the gouernement of Italye which is your countrey, and aboue all I referre vnto your diſcretions, the peace and tranquillitie of the hole common wealth. Therefore he that hath ſuche a charge, by reaſon ought not to ſlepe. For as the wiſe men ſay, to great truſt, is required much diligence. I will ſaye no more, but that I would my ſonne <hi>Comodus</hi> ſhoulde be ſo well taught, that he ſhould haue the feare of god, and the ſcience of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, the vertues of the auncient Romaynes, the approued councell of the aged, the corage of the Romaine youth, and the conſtancy of you whiche are his maſters. Fynally, I would that of al the good he ſhold take the good, as of me he ought to take the heritage, and ſucceſſion of the Empyre. For he is the true prince, and worthy of the empyre, that with his eyes doth beholde the great ſignories he ought to enherite, and dothe employe his harte howe to gouerne it, wherby he ſhal lyue to the great profit of the common wealth. And I proteſte to the immortall gods, with whom I hope to goe, and to the goodnes of my predeceſſours, whoſe faith I am bound to kepe. I proteſte to the Romaine lawes, the whyche I dyd ſweare to obſerue in the conqueſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> wherein I bound my ſelfe to continue, and to the frendeſhyppe of the <hi>Rhodiens,</hi> the whiche I haue offered my ſelfe to kepe, to the ennemitye of the <hi>Affricans,</hi> the whyche not for me, but for the oth of my predeceſſours I haue bounde my ſelfe to mainteine. And I proteſte vnto the veſſell of the hyghe Capitall, where my bones ought to be burnt, that Rome do not complaine of me beyng alyue, nor that in the worlde to come ſhe curſe me after my death: If perchaunce the prince <hi>Comodus</hi> my ſonne (by his wicked lyfe) ſhould be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the loſſe of hinderaunce to the common wealth. And thoughe you whych are his maſters vndoe it, for not geuyng hym dew puniſhement, and he thoroughe hys wicked gouernement deſtroye it, yet I diſcharge my ſelfe by all theſe proteſtations that I haue made, whyche ſhalbe witneſſes of my will. For the father is bound no more towardes his child, but to banyſhe hym from his pleaſures, and to geue him vertuous maſters. And if he be good, he ſhalbe be the glory of the father, the honor of him ſelfe, the wealth of you, and the profite and comoditie of the hole common wealth.</p>

                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:21411:181"/>Truly he that in this point is circumſpecte, is woorthy to be counted a ſage man: For accordyng to the multitude of the perylles of the world, none can be aſſured, vnleſſe he know firſt where the daunger is, wherin he may fal. To ſhew therfore that which by theſe parables I meane, I ſaye, that the tutors and maſters of princes, and great Lordes, ought not to be contented onely to know what ſcience, what doctrine, and what vertue they oughte to ſhewe and teache their ſcollers: but alſo with greater care and diligence the yought to know from what euils or wicked cuſtomes they ought to withdraw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For when the trees are tender and yong, it is more neceſſary to bowe them, and cut of the ſuperfluous braunches with knyues: then to gather their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes with Baſkettes.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which take vpon them to gouerne Moyles, of great pryſe &amp; value, and thoſe that tame and breake horſes of a good race, take great paines that ſuch beaſtes be light, that they leape wel, and be well made to the ſporre, and bridel: but they take much more paines that they be gentill, familiar, &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and aboue all, that they haue no euill qualities. Then ſith it is ſo, maſters ought diligently to watche (if they be good) that in yong Princes there be no apparaunce of any notable vices. For al the vertues which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yong do learne, doth not them ſo much profit: as one onely vice doth them hurte, if they doe therunto conſent, knowyng that therby they may be herafter blamed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed. For if any man knew a beaſt, that is wyld and ſtoburne, and not gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, and will bye him at greate pryce: ſuche a one hath his head more full of follyes then of wyſedome.</p>
                     <p>Albeit that maiſters ought to withdraw their ſcollers from many euil cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geſt all there ar foure principall, in any of the which if the prince be defamed, the maiſter which hath taught him ſhould deſerue great puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <p>Firſt the maiſters ought to refraine in ſuche ſort the tonges of their ſcol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, that neyther in ſport nor in earneſt, they permit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to tell lyes. For the greateſt faulte that is in a good and vertuous man, is to be briefe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth: and the greateſt villanye that is in a vicious man, is to be long in lyes, <hi>Merula</hi> in that .v. booke of <hi>Ceſars</hi> ſaith, that the firſte war that <hi>Vlpius Traianus</hi> made, was againſt <hi>Cebalus</hi> king of <hi>Daces,</hi> who rebelled againſt the Romaines, and with no ſmal victorie ouercame the Emperour <hi>Domitian,</hi> in a battaile which they fought togethers. For as <hi>Naſica</hi> ſayd, the pleaſures that Rome had to ſee many victories were not ſo greate: as the diſpleaſure was whyche ſhe toke, to ſee her ſelfe once ouercome. The good <hi>Vlpius Traianus</hi> gaue battaile to kyng <hi>Cebalus,</hi> wherin <hi>Cebalus</hi> was not onely ouercome, but alſo taken, and afterwardes broughte before the emperour <hi>Traianus,</hi> whyche ſayde vnto him theſe wordes. Speake <hi>Cebalus,</hi> why dideſt thou rebell agaynſt the Romay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſince thou knoweſt that the Romaynes are vnuincible. The kyng <hi>Ceba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> aunſwered him. If the Romaines could not be ouercom, how did I then ouercome the Emperour <hi>Domitian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperour ſayde vnto hym againe: Thou art greatly deceyued (kynge <hi>Cebalus</hi>) to thinke that when thou ouercameſt the Emperour, thou
<pb facs="tcp:21411:182"/>
haddeſt ouercome: the Romaines. For when that <hi>Romulus</hi> founded Rome the Gods ordeyned, that though their emperour dyed in anye battaile, yet not withſtandyng it is not to be thought that the empyre is ouercome. The Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographers made a great matter of the wordes that this <hi>Vlpius Traianus</hi> ſpake. For therin he ſhewed, that the Romaine empire was vnuincible.</p>
                     <p>After that this kyng <hi>Cebalus</hi> was dead, and that (for his deſertes) he was depriued: as the Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> was a mercifull prince, ſo he prouided that a litel child that <hi>Cebalus</hi> hadde, ſhoulde be brought vp in his pallace, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention that if the childe became good, they woulde geue hym the Realme whiche his father (thorough Treaſon) hadde loſte.</p>
                     <p>For in Rome there was an auncient lawe, that all that whiche the father loſt by treaſon, the ſonne ſhould recouer by hys faithfull actes. It chaunced, that the good <hi>Traian</hi> takyng his pleaſure in the gardins of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> ſawe the ſonne of kyng <hi>Cebalus,</hi> and many other yong children of Rome, ſtealynge fruite forth of an orchard, and it is no wonder, for the <hi>Locuſtes</hi> did not ſo much harme to the Corne, as the children do to the fruites, when they entre into the orchardes. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperour afterwardes demaunded him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence he came, he aunſwered: from his ſtudye hearyng Rethoricke: but in dede he came from ſtealing of fruite. The emperour <hi>Traian</hi> was ſo angrie &amp; diſpleaſed that the child was a lyer, that he commaunded he ſhould vtterly be depriued and made voyde of al hope: to recouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realme of his father. The Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> was greatly importuned, as well of ſtraung Imbaſſatours, as of hys owne Countrey men, that he would chaung that cruel ſentence: For prynces in a furie do commaund that, which when they are pacient they doe vndo. The emperour <hi>Traian</hi> aunſwered them, if the father of this child which was kyng <hi>Cebalus</hi> had bene a true prince, he had not loſte hys lyfe, neyther hys Realme, nor had not put me &amp; thempyre ſo many times in daunger: but ſince the father was a lyer, and the ſonne is not true, it were to vniuſt a thynge to render him the Realme, For to me it ſhould be great reproche, and to our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rome as much diſhonour, that ſhe beyng the mother of truthe, ſhoulde geue realmes to children beyng lyers. This was it that <hi>Vlpius Traian</hi> ſpake vnto the ſonne of kyng <hi>Cebalus. Marcus Aurelius</hi> the .xvii. Emperour of Rome had .ii. ſonnes, as before we haue reherſed, the eldeſt of the whiche was called <hi>Comodus:</hi> and his father procured greatly to diſinherit him of the empire: For he would that the ſecond ſon named <hi>Veriſſimus</hi> ſhould haue inherited it: and he did not onely determine it, but alſo ſpake it oft times openly. For that thing is with great difficulty diſſembled, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> exceſſiuely is beloued By chaunce an olde Senator, and frend of Marcus the emperour, one daye, both goyng out of the Senate houſe, ſayd vnto him: I meruaile at the much, moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent prince, why thou doeſt diſherite thy ſonne which is eldeſt, to make thine heyre the yongeſt, knowynge that they are both thy ſonnes, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods haue geuen the no others but them. For the good fathers are bound to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten their children, but they haue not licence to diſherit them. The emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> aunſwered him. If thou were a greke philoſopher, as thou art a Romain citizen, and if thou kneweſt the fathers loue towardes hys childe, thou wouldeſt not take pitie one my ſonne whiche vndoeth the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: but thou ſhouldeſt haue compaſſion on me his father, which doth diſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:21411:182"/>
him. For the chyld ſcarcely knoweth what he loſeth, but I that am hys father doe bewayle the domage whyche I doo vnto hym. For in the ende, there is not in the world ſo cruel a father: but if his ſonne ſhould be hurt with the pomell of the ſwerde in the hande, the father would fele (incontinentlye) the dent of his blade at his harte. In this caſe, I ſweare vnto the by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall gods, that I do that whyche I would not do: and I take that from him whyche I woulde not take. For <hi>Anthonius</hi> my lorde and father in lawe, gaue me the empire, for no other cauſe, but bycauſe he neuer found in me any lye: and for this occaſion I doe depriue my ſonne from it, for that I neuer found in him any trueth. For it is not mete that the Empire being geuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me for that I was true: ſhould be left inheritage to him that is a lier. For in the ende it is better y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſonne do loſe the heritage, then the father ſhoulde loſe his renowme. By theſe two examples, thoſe whiche are the tutors and maiſters of princes and great lordes may ſee, how to be diligent to kepe them from lyes, whileſt they are yong: and it ought to be in ſuch ſorte, that neither in paſtime, neither in earneſt aunſwering they ſhould be ſuffered once to tell a lye. For thoſe that for their pleaſure were accuſtomed to lye in their youth: will not fayle for their profite to lye in their age.</p>
                     <p>Secondarely, the tutors and mayſters ought to keepe their diſciples, that they be no gameſters, and that they doe not accuſtome them ſelues in theyr youth to be vnthriftes: for it is a great token of the decay of the Empire, when the Prince in his youth is affectionated to play. Experience ſheweth vs, that playe is a vice, as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayeth, whiche hath the propertie of a raging dogge: with whome if a man be once bitten (vnleſſe he hath preſent remedie) forthe with he runneth madde, and the diſeaſe alſo continueth with him vncurable vntill the houre of his death. Players not without a cauſe are compared to madde dogges: for al thoſe that vſe it, hurt theyr conſcience, loſe their honour, and conſume theyr ſubſtance. It chaunſeth oft that in that wherin mayſters ſhould be moſt circonſpecte, they (for the moſt parte) are moſt negligent: that is to wete, that vnder the coullet of ſom honeſt recreation, they agree to their ſcollers to vſe ſome paſtyme, which if therin be conteyned no commendable exerciſe, the children ought not to vſe it, nor yet the tutors to ſuffer it. For vice is of ſuch a propertie, that if a chylde in hys youth dare playe apointe: it is to be feared when he commeth to yeares, he will playe hys cote. Wayinge the matter more depely, and aggrauating this vice, I ſaye further, and affirme: that when the children of Princes and great Lordes playe, a man ought not to make account of that which they may winne or looſe: for that of all miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes were moſt miſery, if therefore my penne ſhoulde forbidde them play. For play ought not to be forbidden to yong children, for the money that they loſe: but for the vyces whiche they winne thereby, and for the corrupte maners, which therin they learne. <hi>Octauian,</hi> who was the ſecond Emperour of Rome, and one of the fortunateſt Emperours that euer was, among all his vertues was noted of one thing onely, which is: that from his youth he was to much geuen to play at tennis. Of the which vice he was not onely admoniſhed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatly: but alſo was forbidden it openly. For (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth in hys booke of lawes) when the Emperour was noted of any open vice, they might boldely reproue him in the open Senate. When <hi>Octauian</hi> was for this vice reproued
<pb facs="tcp:21411:183"/>
by the Senate, they ſayde he ſpake theſe wordes. You haue reaſon (O fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conſcript) in takyng from me my paſtime: for it is neceſſary that the vertues of princes ſhould be ſo many, that all men might prayſe them: and their vices ſo fewe, that no man might reproue them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe wordes were notable, and worthy of ſuche an excellent prince. For in the ende, conſideringe their delicate and wanton brynging vp, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the libertie that they haue: we ought to thanke and commende them for the good woorkes whiche they doe, and moſte of all to reioyce for the vices whiche they wante. To our matter therfore, amongeſt the other wicked vices that children get in their youth, when they are players, this is one that they learne to be theues, and lyers. For the money that they playe-to demaunde it their fathers they are afrayde, and aſhamed: and of their owne proper goodes, as yet they haue none in their handes. Wherefore a man may eaſely conclude, that if children playe, of neceſſitie they muſt ſteale. The ſixe and thirty Emperour of Rome was <hi>Claudius Luganus,</hi> a man verye temperate in eating, moderate in apparell, vprighte in iuſtice, and very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in chiualrie: for he did not onelye repulſe the <hi>Gothes</hi> from <hi>Illiria,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vanquiſhed in a battayle the Germaines, wherein were ſlayne aboue a hundred thouſande. This battayle was nere vnto the lake <hi>Veracus,</hi> in a place called <hi>Luganus,</hi> and for a memory of that great battayle and victory they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him <hi>Claudius Luganus.</hi> For it was a cuſtome among the Romaines, that according to the good or euyll workes that princes did: ſo they were iudged, and knowen by ſuche ſurnames, whether it were good or euyll. This Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour had but one onely ſonne, the whiche was a prince comely of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and liuely of vnderſtanding: but aboue all thynges geuen to playe, ſo that theſe good giftes whiche nature gaue him to woorke in vertue, he miſuſed alwayes in playe. And amongeſt younge men he deſyreth rather to haunte vyce: then among the philoſophers to learne vertue. And hereat a man ought not to marueyle, for all men of great courage (vnleſſe they be compelled to doe vertuous actes) doe exerciſe of themſelues many deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vices. It chaunced when this young prince had no more to playe nor gage, he robbed out of his fathers chamber a ryche iewell of golde, whereof alſo his maiſter was preuy. And when the knowledge thereof came to the princes eares, he immediatly diſherited his ſonne of the Empire, and cauſed the head of the maiſter to be cut of his body, &amp; all thoſe likewyſe that plaide with him, to be baniſhed the countrey. This acte made euery man afrayde for correction executed after a good ſorte hath this propertie: that it encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth the good to be good, and feareth the wycked from their wickednes.</p>

                        <hi>Merula</hi> in the tenth booke of <hi>Caeſars</hi> (where as at large he mentioneth this matter) ſaieth, that the Romaines eſtemed more the baniſhemente of thoſe players from Rome: then to haue drouen out the <hi>Gothes</hi> from <hi>Illiria,</hi> and to ſaye the trouthe they had reaſon. For a prince deſerueth a greater crowne of glorie, to baniſhe the vitious from his pallace: then he doeth for chaſing the enemies out of his dominion.</p>

                        <pb n="164" facs="tcp:21411:183"/>THirdly tutors ought to trauayle, that the children whiche they haue in charge, be not light and worldly, nor that they doe conſent that they be to bolde or ſhameles. And I ſaye, that they doe not ſuffer them to be to light or vnconſtant: for of younge men, inconſtant and light, commeth ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an olde man, fonde, and vnthriftie.

I ſay that they doe not conſent they be ſhameleſſe: for of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamefaſtnes, commeth ſclaunderous perſones.</p>
                     <p>Princes and great lordes ought to haue much circumſpection, that their children be brought vp in ſhamefaſtnes, with honeſtie. For the crowne doth not geue ſo much glory to a kyng, nor the head doth more ſet forth the man, nor the iewell more adourne the breaſt, nor yet the ſcepter more become the hande: then ſhamefaſtnes, with honeſtie, beutifieth a younge man. For a man of what eſtate ſo euer he be, the honeſtie which he ſheweth outwardly, doth hide many ſecret vices, wherewith he is endued inwardly. In the time of the reigne of the emperour <hi>Helius Pertinax</hi> (the nyntenthe Emperour of Rome) two conſulles gouerned the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> welth, the one named <hi>Verus,</hi> and the other <hi>Mamillus,</hi> one daye they came to the Emperour and were humble ſuiters to his highnes, beſechinge him, that it would pleaſe hym to receiue their two children into his ſeruice, the eldeſt of the whiche paſſed not as yet twelue yeares of age: the whiche requeſt, after the Emperour had graunted, the fathers were not negligent to bryng them vnto hym, and being come before his preſence, each of them made an oration, the one in Latine and the other in Greke. Wherewith the Emperour was greatly pleaſed, and all the reſidue amaſed: for at that time none ſerued the Romaine princes, but that he were either very apte to cheualry, or els toward in ſciences. As theſe two children in the preſence of the Emperour made their orations, the one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> behelde the Emperour in ſuche ſorte, that his eies neuer went of him, neither once moued his head to loke down to the earth: and the other contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde the earth alwayes, &amp; neuer lift vp his head during his oration. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Emperour (being a graue man) was ſo highly pleaſed with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours of this child, that he did not onely admitte him to ſerue him at his table: but alſo he ſuffred him to enter into his chambre, and this was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment of great eſtimation. For princes did not vſe to be ſerued at their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, nor in their chambers with any, vnleſſe they were of his owne kynred, or auncient ſeruauntes. And concerning the other childe, whiche was his compaignion, the Emperoure retourned againe to his father ſaiynge, that when hereafter he ſhoulde bee more ſhamefaſt, he woulde receiue hym into his ſeruice. And certainly the Emperoure had reaſon: for good and graue princes, ought not to be ſerued with light and ſhameles children. I woulde nowe demaunde fathers whiche loue their children very well, and woulde they ſhoulde be worthy, what it auaileth their children to be faire of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, well diſpoſed of body, liuely of ſprighte, whyte of ſkinne, to haue yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe heeres, to be eloquent in ſpeache, profounde in ſcience, if with all theſe graces that nature geueth them, they be to bolde in that they doe, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleſſe in that they ſaye? the authour hereof is <hi>Patritius Seneſis,</hi> in the firſte booke <hi>De rege &amp; regno.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:184"/>One of the moſte fortunate princes was the great <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> the whiche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt all other vertues, had one moſte ſinguler, which was: that he was neuer ſerued in his pallace with any young man that was vnſhamefaſt, or ſeditious, nor with an olde man which was diſhoneſt. For he ſaid oftetimes that princes ſhall neuer be well beloued: if they haue about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liers, or ſclau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers. This good emperour ſpake as a man of experience, and very ſage: for if the counſellers and familiars of princes be euil taught and vnpacient, they offende many: and if they be liers, they deceiue all: and if they be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, they ſclaunder the people. And theſe offences be not ſo great vnto them that committe them, as they be vnto the prince whiche ſuffreth them. The emperour <hi>Theodoſe</hi> had in his pallace two knightes, the one called <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> and the other <hi>Stelliconus,</hi> by whoſe prudence and wiſdome the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth was ruled and gouerned. And as <hi>Ignacius Baptiſta</hi> ſaieth, they twoo were the tutors &amp; gouernours of the children of <hi>Theodoſe,</hi> whoſe names were <hi>Archa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> and <hi>Honorius:</hi> For as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaieth, when good princes do die, they ought to be more carefull to procure maiſters and tutors whiche ſhall teache their children, then to procure realmes or kingdomes for to enriche them. Theſe twoo maiſters, <hi>Stelliconus</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus</hi> had in the pallace of <hi>Theodoſe</hi> eche of them a ſonne, the which were maruellous wel taught, and very ſhamefaſt: and for the contrary, the two princes <hi>Honorius,</hi> and <hi>Archadius,</hi> were euill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered and not very honeſt. And therfore the good emperour <hi>Theodoſe</hi> tooke theſe children oftetimes, and ſet them at his table: and contrary he woulde not once beholde his owne. Let no man marueile though a prince of ſuche a grauitie, did a thing of ſo ſmal importaunce: for to ſay the truthe, the ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt children, and wel taughte, are but robbers of the hartes of other men.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the tutors and maiſters of princes oughte to take good heade that when the younge princes their ſchollers waxe great, that they geue not them ſelues ouer to the wicked vice of the fleſhe, ſo that the ſenſualitie and euill inclination of the wanton childe, ought to be remedied by the wiſedom of the chaſte maiſter. For this curſed fleſhe is of ſuche condition, that if once by wantonnes the wicket be opened, death ſhall ſoner approche: then the gate ſhalbe ſhut agayne.</p>
                     <p>The trees which budde and caſte leaues before the time, our hope is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to eate of their fruite in ſeaſon. I meane, that when chyldren haunte the vice of the fleſhe, whyles they be young: there is ſmall hope of goodnes to be loked in them when they be olde. And the elder we ſee them waxe, the more we may be aſſured of their vices. And where we ſee that vice encreaſeth: there we may affirme that vertue diminiſheth. <hi>Plato</hi> in his ſeconde booke of lawes ordeyneth, and commaundeth, that younge men ſhoulde not marye before they were .xxv. yeares of age: and the younge maydens at .xx. becauſe at that age their fathers abide leſſe daungers in begetting them, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of them lyfe, and the children alſo which are borne, haue more ſtrength againſt the aſſaultes of death. Therefore if it be true (as it is true in dede) I aſke nowe, if to be maried and get children (whiche is the ende of mariage) the Philoſophers doe not ſuffer, vntill ſuche time as they be men: then I ſay that maiſters ought not to ſuffer their ſchollers to haunte the vices of the fleſhe when they be chyldren. In this caſe, the good fathers oughte not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21411:184"/>
alone to committe this matter to their tutors: but alſo thereunto to haue an eye them ſelues. For oftetimes they wyll ſaye they haue bene at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions in the temples when in dede they haue offered veneriall ſacrifice to the Courtiſan. The vyce of the fleaſhe is of ſuche condition, that a man can not geue hym ſelfe to it, without grudge of conſcience, withoute hurte of his renowme, without loſſe of his goodes, without ſhortenynge of his lyfe, and alſo without offence to the common wealth: for oftetymes, men encly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuche vyce, doe rebell, trouble, and ſclaunder the people. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied me greatly, in that whiche he wryteth in the ſeconde booke <hi>De Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> to <hi>Nero,</hi> where he ſayeth theſe wordes.</p>
                     <p>If I knewe the Gods would pardon me, and alſo that men woulde not hate me: yet I enſure thee for the vylenes thereof, I would not ſynne in the fleaſhe. And truly <hi>Seneca</hi> had reaſon, for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayeth that all beaſtes after the acte of venery are ſory, but the Cocke alone. O gouernours and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of great princes, and lordes, by that immortall God whiche created vs I coniure you, and for that you owe to the nobilite I deſyre you, that you wyll brydle with a ſharpe ſnaffle your charge, and geue them not the rayne to followe vyces: for if theſe younge chyldren lyue, they wyll haue tyme enough to ſearche, to followe, to attayne, and alſo to caſte of thoſe yokes. For through our frayletie, this wicked vyce of the fleaſhe, in euery place, in al ages, in euery eſtate, and at all tymes (be it by reaſon, or not) is neuer out of ceaſon What ſhall I ſaye to you in this caſe? if the chyldren paſſe the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes of their youthe without the brydle: then they be voyde of the loue of God, they followe the trompet of ſenſualitie, after the ſounde whereof they runne headlong into the yoke, and loſe that whiche profiteth, to wynne that whiche hurteth? For in the carnall vices, he that hath the leaſt of that that ſenſualitie deſireth, hath muche more thereof then reaſon wylleth. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the maiſters are negligent, the children bolde, their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynges blynded, and ſeing that their appetites doe accomplyſhe beaſtly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: I aſke nowe, what remayneth to the chylde, and what contentation hath he of ſuche filthe and naughtines? Truly ſince the fleaſhly and vicious man is ouercome with his appetite, of thoſe that eſcape beſte I ſee none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruite, but that their bodies remayne diſeaſed, and their vnderſtanding blynded, their memory dulled, their ſence corrupted, their wil hurted, their reaſon ſubuerted, and their good fame loſt, and worſte of all, the fleaſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth always fleſhe. O how many you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men are deceiued, thinking that for to ſatiſfie &amp; by once engaging them ſelues to vices, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they ſhal ceaſe to be vicious: the which thing not only doth not profite them, but alſo is very hurtefull vnto them. For fier is not quenched with dry woode, but with cold water. But O god what ſhal we do, ſince that now a daies y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers do as much eſteme their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for being fine, &amp; bold minio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if thei wer very profond in ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or hardy in feles of arms? &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is worſt, thei ofttimes make more of their baſtards gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their legitimate child co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued in matrimony. what ſhal we ſay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mothers? truly I am aſhamed to ſpeake it, but thei ſhold be more aſhamed to do it, which is, becauſe they would not diſpleaſe their huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, thei hide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

wickednes of their children, they put the children of their harlottes to the norſe, they redeme their gages, they geue them money to playe at dyce, they reconcile them to their fathers when they haue offended, they borowe them money to redeme them when they are indebted: finally they are makers of ther bodies, and vndoers of their ſoules. I ſpeake this incidently, for that the maiſters would correcte the children, but the fathers and mothers forbydde them. For it litle auayleth for one to pricke the horſe with the ſpurre, when he that ſitteth vpon him holdeth hym backe with the brydle. Therefore to our matter, what ſhal we do to remedie this il in the young man, which in his fleſhe is vitious? Truly I ſee no other remedye, but with moiſte earth to quenche the flaming fier, and to keape him from the occaſions of vice. For in the warre, honour by tarrying is obteyned: but in the vice of the fleſhe, the victorie by flying is wonne.</p>

                     <p>This Philoſopher would ſet vs vnderſtand that iuſtice is ſo excellent a vertue, that ſhe paſſeth all mens capacitie: ſynce ſhe made heauen her manſion place, &amp; could fynde no man in the whole earth that would entertayne her in hys houſe. During the tyme that menne were chaſte, gentle, pitiefull, pacient, embracers of vertue, honeſt, and true, Iuſtice remained in the earthe with them: but ſince they are conuerted vnto adulterers, tyraunts, geuen to be proud, vnpacient, lyers, and blaſphemers, ſhe determined to forſake them and to aſcend vp into heauen. So that thys Philoſopher concluded, that for the wickednes that men commit on earthe, Iuſtice hath lept from them into heauen. Though this ſeme to be a poeticall fiction, yet it comprehendeth in it hygh and profound doctrine: the which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be very clere, for where we ſe iuſtice, there are fewe theues, few mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, fewe tyrants, &amp; few blaſphemours. Finally I ſay, that in that houſe or common wealth where iuſtice remaineth, a man cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit vice, &amp; much leſſe deſſemble with the vicious. <hi>Homer</hi> deſyrous to exalt iuſtice, could not tell what to ſay more, but to call kinges, the children of the great god <hi>Iupiter:</hi> and that not for the naturalitie they haue, but for the offyce of iuſtice whyche they miniſter. So that <hi>Homer</hi> concludeth, that a man ought not to call iuſt princes other, but the children of god. The deuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the fourth booke of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth ſaieth, that the chiefeſt gift god gaue to men is: that they beyng (as they be) of ſuch vyle cley, ſhould be gouerned by iuſtice. I would to God all thoſe which reade thys writyng, vnderſtood right well that which <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid: For if men were not indued wyth reaſon, and gouerned by iuſtice, amongeſt all beaſtes none were ſo vnprofytable. Let reaſon be taken from man wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth he is indued, and iuſtice whereby he is gouerned: then ſhall men eaſely perceiue in what ſort he wyll lead his lyfe. He cannot fyght as the Elephant, nor defend hym ſelfe as the Tygre, nor he can hunte as the Lyon neyther labour as the Oxe: and that whereby he ſhould profyte (as I thynke) is, that he ſhould eate Beares &amp; Lyons in his lyfe, as now he ſhalbe eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of wormes after his death. All the Poets that inuented fictions, all the Oratours which made Orations, al the Philoſophers which wrote bookes, al the ſages which left vs their doctrynes, and all the Princes which inſtituted lawes ment no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els, but to perſwade vs to think how briefe &amp; vnprofitable this lyfe ys, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:21411:186"/>
howe neceſſary a thing iuſtice is therein. For the filth &amp; corrupcion which the body hath without the ſoule: the ſelfe ſame hath the common welth wythout iuſtice. We cannot deny but that the Romaynes haue bene proude, enuyous, aduouterers, ſhameleſſe, &amp; ambicious: but yet with all theſe faultes they haue bene great obſeruers of iuſtice. So that if god gaue the ſo many tryumphes beyng loden and enuironned with ſo manye vices: it was not for the vertues they had, but for the great iuſtice which they did adminiſter. <hi>Plinie</hi> in hys ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke ſaieth, that <hi>Democritus</hi> affirmed there were two gods which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the vniuerſall worlde: that is to wete, Rewarde and Puniſhement. Whereby we may gather, that nothing is more neceſſary then true and right iuſtice. For the one rewardeth the good, &amp; the other leaueth not vnpuniſhed the euill. Saint <hi>Auſtyne</hi> in the fyrſt booke <hi>De ciuitare dei</hi> ſayeth theſe words. Iuſtyce taken awaye, what are realmes but dennes of theues? truely he had great reaſon. For if there were no whips for vacabondes, gags for blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, fynes for periury, fyre for heretiques, ſworde for murderers, galouſe for theues, nor priſon for rebelles: we may boldly affirme that there woulde not be ſo manye beaſtes on the mountaines, as there woulde be theues in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. In many thinges or in the greateſt parte of the common welth, we ſee that bread, wyne, corne, fyſhe, woll, and other thinges neceſſary for the lyfe of the people wanteth: but we neuer ſawe but malicious menne in euerye place dyd abounde. Therefore I ſweare vnto you, that it were a good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to chaunge all the wycked menne in the common wealth, for one onlye poore ſheepe in the ſylde. In the comon wealth we ſee naught els but whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng dayly, beheddyng, ſlayinge, drownyng, and hanginge: but notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng this, the wicked whiche remayne ſtyll are ſo many in nomber, that if all thoſe ſhoulde be hanged that deſerue it by iuſtyce, a man could not fynd hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſufficient, nor gallowſes to hange them vppon. Admitte according to the varietie of realmes &amp; prouinces, that dyuers lawes and cuſtomes haue bene inſtituted therein: Yet for a truth there was neuer nor neuer ſhalbe found any nation or common wealthe in the worlde ſo barbarous, but hath bene foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of iuſtice. For to affirme that menne can bee preſerued wythout iuſtice, is as muche as to ſaye the fiſhe can liue wythout water. Howe is it poſſible that a common wealth may liue without iuſtice: ſith without her cannot bee ruled one onelye perſonae? <hi>Plinie</hi> in an epiſtle ſaieth, that he him ſelfe hauinge the charge of a prouince in <hi>Affrike,</hi> demaunded an olde man and in gouernement experte, what he myght doe to adminiſter iuſtice well? the aged manne aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Doe iuſtice of thy ſelfe, yf thou wilt be a miniſter thereof: For the good iudge, wyth the ryght yarde of hys owne lyfe, ought to meaſure the whole ſtate of the common wealth. And he ſayde further, if thou wylt be right wyth menne, and clean before god, beware of preſumpcion in thyne offyce. For the proude and preſumptuous iudges often tymes doe contrary in their wordes, and alſo exceade in theire deedes. <hi>Plinie</hi> alſo ſaieth that he profited more with the counſayle thys olde man gaue hym; then wyth all that euer he had reade in his bookes. O to howe muche is he bounde that hath taken vppon him to adminiſter iuſtice? For if ſuch one be an vpright man, hee accompliſheth that whereunto he is bounde: but if ſuche one of hym ſelfe bee vniuſte, iuſtlye of god he ought to bee puniſhed, and lykewyſe of menne to bee accuſed.</p>

The office of a good iudge is to defend the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welth, to help the innocent, to ayde the ſimple, to correcte the offender, to honour the vertuous, to help the orphanes, to do forthe poore, to bridel the am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bicious: finallye by iuſtice he ought to geue eche one his owne, &amp; to diſpoſſeſſe thoſe which hold any thing wrongfully of others.</p>
                     <p>When a prince commaundeth any man to take the charge of iuſtice, &amp; ſuch one doth not ſeeke it of him ſelfe, if perchaunce afterwardes he did not in all points vprightly in the adminiſtracion therof, he might haue ſome excuſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that though he hath accepted it, it was not with minde becauſe he woulde erre, but becauſe with good will he would obey. What ſhall we ſaye of manye which without ſhame, without knowlege, without experience, &amp; without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, do procure the office of iuſtice? O if princes knew what they geue whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they geue the charge to any to gouerne the common wealth? I ſweare vnto you, that they were better to giue them goods to fynd them for .20. yeres: then for to truſt them wyth the charge of iuſtice .20. daies. What a thing is it to ſee ſome men ſhameleſſe, diſhoneſt, great talkers, gluttons, ambitious, &amp; coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous: the whiche wythout anye reaſonable cauſe aucthority or knowledge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde of prynces an office of iuſtice, as if by iuſtice they dyd demaund their own?

There remayneth in this caſe more as yet, that is, that if thoſe curſed men do not attayne to that whych they demaunde, &amp; if thoſe (hauing no conſcience) doe not geue it: then they blaſpheme &amp; complayne of thoſe whych are in fauour with princes, as yf they had done them greate iniurye. O what trouble is it to good men to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhe the deſyre of the euill. For the couetous and ambicious perſons doe but deſyre that the good men had the lyke payne in geuyng that they haue in demaunding. Many tymes I haue thought with my ſelfe, wherin ſo many damages of the common wealth ſhould conſiſt, ſuch diſobedience, ſuch contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, and ſo many theftes: and in the ende I fynde, that all or the moſt part procede in that, that they prouyde for miniſters of iuſtice, not for conſcience ſake, but for couetouſnes onely. Admyt that it appertayne to all to deſyre and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:187"/>
procure iuſtice: yet to none it appertaineth ſo muche to procure and defend it, as to the royall perſonne, whiche the ſubiectes ought ſome tyme to feare: but princes are bound to miniſter it equally to all. It is a great matter that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be pure in lyfe, and that theire houſes be well ordered, to the end that their iuſtice be of credyte and auctoritie: For he which of him ſelfe is vniuſt, geueth no hope that an other at hys handes ſhoulde haue iuſtice. He whiche cannot gouerne his owne houſe can euill gouerne the whole common wealth. Theſe princes which are true in theire wordes, cleane in theire lyues, &amp; iuſt in theire woorkes: though ſome tyme they erre in the adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon welth, all excuſe them, ſayeng that they erre not thorough the malyce of them ſelues, but rather thorough the euill counſayle of others. So that all which the good prince doth they commende, and all the euill that chaunceth they excuſe. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarche</hi> in the ſeconde booke of hys common wealth ſayeth, that herein ſome princes differ from others: For the euyll prince is onely obeyed, but the good prince is obeyed, feared, and loued. And more ouer he that is good, maketh heauy thinges light with his goodnes: and the tyraunt that is euyll, maketh thinges whiche are light to be very heauy through his naughtynes. Happy is the Prince whiche is obeyed: but muche more happy he, which is obeyed, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and loued. For the body is weary often tymes to obeye: but the harte is neuer conſtrained to loue. <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperour was once demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of theſe 2. thinges, that is to wete: whether to rewarde the good, or to puniſh the euill were for a prince more naturall. He anſwered. As naturall as bothe the right and left arme is in a man: ſo neceſſary is reward &amp; punyſhement in a prince. But as we helpe our ſelues more with the right arme then with the lefte: ſo the prince ought more to endeuour him ſelfe to rewarde then to puniſhe. For puniſhemement ought to be by the handes of a ſtraunger: but reward ought to be wyth hys owne proper handes. When we perſwade princes to be iuſte, and that they doe iuſtice, it is not to be vnderſtanded that they ſhould behead murtherers, banniſhe rebelles and ſedicious perſones, hange theues, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye felons aliue. For ſuche or other lyke thinges, rather appertaine to bloudy hangemen, then to pitiefull kings. All the profite of iuſtice is, in that the prince be honeſt of perſon, carefull for hys houſholde, zelous of the common wealth, and not large of his conſcience. For princes ought not to bee commended for murderyng many cruelly: but for refourmyng the common wealth louyngly. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the comfortable oration that he wrote to <hi>Appoloni,</hi> ſpeakynge of the lawes whiche <hi>Promotheus</hi> gaue to the <hi>Egiptians:</hi> amongeſt the reſidue he reſited theſe three that followe.</p>
                     <p>We ordeine and commaund, that princes laye not handes on others for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny crymes or offences done vnto hym ſelfe.

                        <hi>SParthianus</hi> in the lyues that he wrote of .30. tyrauntes ſaide, that <hi>Ciriacus</hi> the tyraunt, had a memoriall made of certeine of the Senatours whome he woulde haue killed: and when the thinge was diſcouered they ſlewe him. They founde in the handes of an other tiraunt named <hi>Regilius,</hi> after he was deade, a memoriall of thoſe whiche with his owne handes he had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their lyues: wherefore they afterwarde depriued him of his buriall O how many iudges are there in this worlde, that do aſmuch auaunce them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues of thoſe whom they haue cauſed to be whipt, to be ſlaine, to be beheaded, to be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged quartered &amp; ſlaine: as others do which haue redemed many cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyues, or haue maryed many orphanes. Thoſe iudges which according to the order of lawes, cuſtomes, and iuriſdiccions doe puniſhe the euill, I doe well allowe: but to reioyce and auaunce them ſelues of them whome they haue condemned, I vtterly abhorre. For the vertuous and chriſtian iudge ought rather to ſhed teares in the churches: then by affection to ſhed bloude of men in the ſeate of iudgement. And for the confirmacion of that whiche I haue ſayde, I affirme, that the good iudge and gouernour of the common wealth, ought not to beare in mynde the murthers and ſlaughters done by others: but to recorde the iniuries whiche they haue done them ſelues. For in other mens offences we ought to be ſilent: and for our owne iniquities we ought to be penitent. Iudges execute ſome puniſhementes, whiche menne diſallowe, and god doth approue: an other tyme god condemneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, though the world do allowe them: therefore the ſureſt thing for ſuche iudges is, not to reioiſe of their brethren whom they haue corrected, but what they them ſelues for their owne offences haue deſerued. In iudging others, by falſe witnes, the iudges manye tymes againſt theire wils doe erre: but in theire owne matters they can neuer erre (vnleſſe they will) ſince the offences whiche we committe are alwaies certaine. Therefore it greueth mee that there bee ſome ſo euill: whiche beinge accuſed before god woulde excuſe them ſelues before menne, yet theire owne brethren with falſe witneſſes they dare condempne. Greate care ought princes to haue, to examine them whome they will make iudges and gouernoures. For the iudge whyche daylye maketh not an accoumpte with his conſcience in ſecrete, ſhall commit euerye houre a thouſande euylles in the common wealth. O poore and miſerable common wealthe, where the gouernours and iudges thereof doe not caſt theire eyes but vnto them wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For there are manye iudges whyche imploye theyre ſtudye more to geate frindes, to mayntayne theire ſtate proudlye: then for to read bookes, to iudge mennes cauſes vprightly. The iudge which
<pb facs="tcp:21411:188"/>
neuer readeth, the iudge whiche neuer ſtudieth, the iudge whiche neuer ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth boke, the iudge which is neuer in his houſe, the iudge which day &amp; night robbeth, howe is it poſſible that he execute one true iuſtice? There can bee no greater feare in a man, nor ſclaunder more greate in the common welth, then when the iudge (who ought to iudge and chaſtiſe the offences of others) is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ouerwhelmed with vices him ſelfe. The iudge which preſumeth to be good, and wil be good, and deſireth to be good: a manne ſhoulde finde him no where, vnleſſe he be ſtudying in his houſe, or ſitting in the place of iuſtice. Let not princes truſt vppon this, when they prouyde iudges and gouernours for to iudge, ſaieng: that if they fynde any euill, they wil ſoone cut him of, for ſuche are ſo euil, that if they want to meanes to get to thoſe offices, they ſhal want no cautils nor corrupt frindes to ſuborne them therein. When princes &amp; great lordes ſhall finde anye iudge euill, I counſaile them to auoide him immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, or that they ſhewe them ſelues not contented with his dooinges: for ſuche one ſhal forthwith enforce him ſelfe to doe iuſtice, with intencion that thoſe of the common wealth myght deſire him to be theire iudge. Although my penne doth reproue theſe Iudges whiche are negligent and careleſſe, the whiche neither by knowledge can iudge, nor with ſtoutnes puniſhe. The iudges whiche iudge, and gouerne, ought not to be with all ſo familiar, that all dare take vppon them to aſke him: for in this caſe if ſome commend his gentle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſacion, others will blame his parciall iuſtice. I counſaile, admoniſhe, and require Princes, that they content them ſelues not only to be true, pitifull, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſte, and vertuous, nor yet to be iuſte: but that it is as well neceſſarie they be obſeruers of iuſtice. For let them knowe that there is great difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene him that is iuſt, and an other that doth miniſter iuſtice: for to the prince that is good, commeth honour to his parſonne, but from him that miniſtreth iuſtice, commeth profite to his common wealth. Peraduenture it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee the Prince that will tell no lye, and to ſee his miniſters not to ſpeak one truthe? peraduenture I do not thinke my ſelf ſclaundered, to ſe the prince temperate in eatinge, and to ſee all his ſeruauntes diſtempered bothe wythe eating and drinkinge? peraduenture, and it is no cauſe to muſe vppon, to ſee the princes chaſte and honeſte: and to ſee theire ſeruauntes in fleſhe, filthye and diſſolute? peraduenture it is no cauſe to meruaile to ſee the prince iuſte, and to loue iuſtice: and that verye fewe of hys miniſters doe miniſter it.</p>
                     <p>The ende why all theſe thinges are ſpoken is, to aduertiſe Princes that they bee not ſo carefull to bee chaſte, ſober, true and iuſt, but that they know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theire gouernoures and iudges are corrupted, couetous, gredy, vnſhame faſte, lyers, or brybers. For if it toucheth vs much that oure Princes be good: ſo much more it toucheth vs that the miniſters be not euil. One of the things wherein princes ought to prouyde with their iudges and gouernours is, that by no meanes they ſuffer theire lawes and auncient cuſtomes to bee broken in theire common wealthe: and that in theire ſteedes ſtraunge cuſtomes bee not introduced. For the comminaltye is ſo variable in that they ſaye, and ſo light in that they aſke, that they woulde daylye ſee a newe kinge, and hourely chaunge a newe lawe. <hi>Plinie</hi> in an epiſtle that he writeth to <hi>Eſcario</hi> ſaieth. <hi>Optime apud Perſas capitalem per legem fuit prohibitum, nouos aut peregrinos
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21411:188"/>
mores inducere.</hi> As if he ſpake more plainelye. Amongeſt the <hi>Perſes</hi> it was a lawe inuiolable, that no man ſhoulde bringe into the common wealth anye ſtraunge cuſtome: &amp; for ſuche an offence they ſhoulde paye none other raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but the loſſe of theire heades. As menne dayly doe diminiſhe in vertue (vnleſſe by force they bee witholden) and augment in vanitie: ſo they woulde inuent newe deuyſes and ſtraunge cuſtomes, wherewith men ſhoulde be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, and the common wealthe deſtroyed. For ſtraunge meates doe alter mennes ſtomackes. When thoſe of <hi>Creta</hi> were vngentlye vſed of the <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diens,</hi> they did not praye to theire godes to ſende them peſtylence, warre, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, or ſedition amonge theire enemies: but that they woulde ſuffer ſome euil maners to bee brought in amongeſt theire people. Let not thoſe thinke that ſhall reade this, that it was a ſmall curſe thoſe of <hi>Creta</hi> deſired, and that it was a ſmall reuenge whiche God gaue them of theire enemyes, if he gaue them that whiche they dyd requyre: For from warres, famin, and peſtylence, ſome maye eſcape: but with the newe and ſtraunge deuyſes, we ſee all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe. Of manye thinges the Hiſtorians doe reproue the Emperour <hi>Sergius Galba,</hi> and for one alone they doe praiſe him, whiche is that he neuer conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that in Rome anye newe lawe ſhoulde bee made, nor anye olde cuſtome broken. And hee commaunded that thoſe ſhoulde bee greuouſlye puniſhed, whiche brought in anye newe lawe: and hee rewarded thoſe whiche put hym in mynde of anye olde cuſtome, the whiche he commaunded to bee obſerued. It is a mockerye, yea (better to ſaye) a ſclaunder, to ſee that ſome younge iudges will doe that of the common wealthe, whiche a Taylour dothe of a gowne, (that is to ſaye) to tourne hym within and without, before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynde, whiche they ought not to doe, nor the people to conſent thereunto.</p>
                     <p>For the Prince dothe not ſende them to make lawes, nor to bringe in newe orders, but to the ende that they doe onelye preſerue the common wealthe in theire good cuſtomes. Princes ought alſo to take greate care that vnto lyttle and greate, riche and poore, they miniſter equall iuſtice, ſithe there is no dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyne nor humayne lawe that geueth them power and aucthoritie to corrupt it, for if a Prince cannot wythout reaſon diſpoſe his owne goods, much leſſe he can make lawes and ſell iuſtice. We doe not denye a Prince but that he is lorde of beaſtes, of fyſh, of byrdes, of mynes, of mountaines, of ſeruaunts and of fyeldes, finallye that hee is lorde of the ſea and lande: but therefore we will not graunt hym that he is lorde of iuſtice. For there is none other true Lorde of iuſtice but God, whiche is the ſelfe ſame iuſtice. When a Prince dyeth and maketh his will hee ſaieth: I leaue all my realmes &amp; ſeignories to the prince my ſonne and legittimate heire, and doe leaue vnto my ſeconde ſonne ſuch an eſtate and duchye, and to my doughter ſuche landes, and to all I recommend iuſtice, to the ende they doe obſerue it, and cauſe it to bee obſerued euerye one in his owne countrey. It is muche to note that the father dothe not ſaie that he leaueth vnto his ſonne iuſtice, but that he doth recommend it vnto hym: ſo that the good princes ought to thinke that they haue not inherited iuſtyce of theire predeceſſoures in fourme of a patrimonie, but that God gaue it vntoo them of truſte. Prynces of all thinges maye bee called lordes ſaue onelye of iuſtice, wherof they are but onely miniſters. We dare boldly ſaye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince or gret lord which iudgeth cauſes not according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuine wil, but accordi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to
<pb facs="tcp:21411:189"/>
theire owne affection, we will not call him a iuſte iudge, but a rouing theefe. For the prince is muche worſe whiche robbeth god of iuſtice: then the theefe whiche ſtealeth the goods from menne. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> reciteth much wickednes of <hi>Domician,</hi> and the greateſt of all was, the poore, the Orphans and thoſe whiche coulde doe little, he alwaies puniſhed: &amp; the other that were riche and of aucthoritie he pardoned. He compounded with ſome for money, and with other he diſſembled for fauour. <hi>Lampridius</hi> ſaide of <hi>Alexander Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> the .25. Emperour of Rome, that he neuer kepte in his courte anye euyll man, or ſuffered any of his parentes to be vicious. And when he was deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on a time why he baniſhed one of his coſyns, ſince he was yong &amp; a child? he aunſwered them whiche entreated him for him and alleged: That though he was yonge &amp; his coſin, yet <hi>Charior eſt mihi reſpub.</hi> as if more plainly he had ſaid, I haue none other nerer of kinne to me in my palace then the common wealth. O high, and muche more higher woordes, worthy for a truthe to bee written in princes hartes, whereby they ought to be aduertiſed, that he ſaid not, I take for my kynne one parte of the common wealthe. For the prince whiche feareth god, and deſired to be founde iuſt, as he will indifferentlye bee obeyed of all, ſo ought he equally to adminiſter iuſtice to all. If they wyll not credite me nor my penne, let them credit <hi>Plato</hi> in the bookes of his common wealth: who geueth libertie and lycence to all the Plebeyans, to the end that euery one doe loue his wife, his children, and his parentes. And this ſorte of loue he will not that princes haue, to whome he perſwadeth that firſt aboue all thinges they loue theire common wealthe: for if the Prince doe loue anye other thinge aboue his common wealth, it is vnpoſſible but that one daye for the loue of that he wil writhe iuſtice. When <hi>Plato</hi> gaue not lyce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Princes not to enlarge their loue on diuers thinges, peraduenture he woulde coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile them that they ſhoulde doe ſome wronges. It chaunſeth ofte tymes that princes doe omitte iuſtice, not for that they will not adminiſter it but becauſe they will not be enfourmed of thinges, whyche they ought to remedye, and looke vnto. And thys is vnexcuſable, where he hurteth hys honour, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth hys conſcience. For at the daye of iudgement, thoughe he bee not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for malyce: yet he ſhalbee condemned for neglygence. The prince which is carefull, to ſee and enquire the dominages of his realmes: we maye ſaye that if he doth not prouyde for them, it is becauſe he can doe no more, but hee whiche is neglygent to ſee them, and knowe them: we cannot ſaye but if hee leaue to prouyde, it is for that hee will not. The prince or greate lorde, whych dare take vppon him ſuche thynges, what name or renowme maye we geue him? I woulde not we ſhoulde call ſuche a one father of the common wealth: but deſtroyer of hys countrey. For there can be no tirannye greater, nor more vnequall: then for the Phiſicion to aſke his duetye for hys cure, before he hath begone to miniſter the medicine. That Princes and greate lordes deſyre to knowe theire reuenewes, I alowe them: but in that they care not to knowe the dommages of theire common wealthes, I doe diſcommende them. For the people paye tribute to theire Princes, to the ende they ſhoulde delyuer them from theire enemies, and defende them from tyrauntes. For the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges whyche wilbee euill, thoughe I ſaye muche, it will profite lytle: but to thoſe whyche deſyre to be good, that whiche is ſpoken (as I thinke) ſuffyſeth.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21411:189"/>
Notwithſtandinge that whiche is ſpoken I ſay, that iudges and gouernours ought to conſider well with them ſelues, and ſee if they wil be counted for iuſt miniſters, or cruell tirauntes. For the office of a tyraunt is, to robbe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth: and the office of the good Prince is, to refourme the people.</p>
                     <p>Princes and greate lordes, haue more buſynes then they thinke they haue: to ſee all thoſe whiche will ſee them, and to heare all thoſe whiche will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain vnto them. And the cauſe hereof is, admitte that whiche the ſubiect demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, he preſentlye cannot geue, nor that whereof he complaineth, he cannot remedye: yet notwithſtandynge they remaine after a ſorte contented, ſayeng that they haue nowe ſhewed all theire complaintes and iniuries to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For the wounded hartes often tymes vtter their inward paines whiche they feele, without any hope to receiue comfort of that which they deſyre. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarche</hi> in his <hi>Apothegmes</hi> ſayeth, that a poore and aged woman, deſired kyng Philipe of <hi>Macedonie</hi> (whiche was the father of kinge <hi>Alexander</hi> the greate) that he woulde heare her with iuſtice: and ſithe ſhe was verye importunate vppon him, kyng Philip ſaied on a daye vnto her.

                     <head>¶Of an oracion whiche a villayne dwellinge neere to the ryuer of Danuby made before the Senatours of Rome, concerning the tyranies and oppreſſions, which their officers vſed in his countrey. And the oracion is deuyded into three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Cap. iii.</head>
                     <p>IN the .x. yeare of the reigne of the good emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> there happened in Rome a generall peſtilence: the whiche being ſo outragious, the good emperour went into <hi>Campaigne,</hi> whiche at that tyme was verye healthfull, and without diſeaſes, thoughe it was very drye, and wanted much of that which was neceſſarie: yet notwithſtanding, the good Emperour was there with all the principall Senatours of Rome. For in tyme of peſtilence, men doe not ſeeke where they ſhould reioice their parſonnes: but where they maye ſaue theire lyues. <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> being there in <hi>Campania,</hi> was ſore vexed with a feuer. And as his condicion was alwaies, to be amongeſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: ſo at that tyme hys ſickenes required to be viſited of phiſicions. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorte that he had in hys pallace was verye greate, as well of Philoſophers for to teache: as of phiſitions for to diſpute. For this prince ordeyned hys lyfe in ſuche ſorte: that in his abſence thinges touchinge the warre were well proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and in hys preſence was nothynge but matters of knowledge argued. It chaunſed one daye as <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was enuironed with Senatours, Philoſophers, phiſitions, and other ſage men, a queſtion was moued among them, howe greatly Rome was chaunged, not onelye in buyldinges, whyche almoſte were vtterlye decayed: but alſo in maners, whiche were wholly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted: the cauſe of all thys euill grewe, for that Rome was full of flatterers: and deſtitute of thoſe whiche durſte ſaye the trueth. Theſe and ſuche other lyke words heard: the emperour toke vp his hand and bleſſed him, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them a notable example, ſayeng. In the firſt yere that I was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſull
<pb facs="tcp:21411:190"/>
there came a poore villayne from the riuer of Danubye, to aſke iuſtice of the Senate, agaynſt a Cenſour whyche dyd ſore oppreſſe the people, and in dede he dyd ſo well propounde hys complaint, and declare the follye and iniuryes whych the iudges dyd in hys countrey: that I doubt whether <hi>Marcus Cicero</hi> could vtter it better wyth hys tonge, or the renowmed <hi>Homer</hi> haue written it more eloquently with his penne. This villayne had a ſmall face, great lippes, hollow eyes, hys colour burnte, curled heare, bareheaded, hys ſhoes of a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pige ſkynne, hys coate of gotes ſkynne, hys girdell of bull ruſſhes, a longe bearde and thicke, hys eye breyes couered hys eyes, the ſtomacke, &amp; the neck couered wyth ſkynnes, heared as a beare, and a clubbe in hys hand. Without doubt when I ſawe him enter into the Senate, I imagined it had beene a beaſt in fourme of a man: and after I hearde that whyche he ſayde, I iudged hym to be a God (if there are Gods) amongeſt menne. For if it was a fearfull thyng to beholde hys perſonne, it was no leſſe monſtrous to heare his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. At that tyme, there was greate preaſe at the dore of the Senate, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye and dyuers perſonnes, for to ſolicite the affaires of theire prouinces: yet notwithſtanding this villayne ſpake before the others, for twoe cauſes. The one, for that men were deſyrous to heare what ſo monſtrous a man woulde ſay: the other becauſe the Senatours had this cuſtome, that the complayntes of the poore ſhould be hearde, before the requeſtes of the riche. Wherfore this villayne afterwardes in the middeſt of the Senate, began to tel his tale, and the cauſe of hys comminge thither: in the whiche he ſhewed him ſelfe no leſſe bolde in woordes, then he was in his attyre ſtraunge, and ſaide vnto them in thys ſorte. O fathers conſcripte, and happy people, I <hi>Mileno</hi> a ploughman, dwelling nere vnto the ryuer of <hi>Danube,</hi> doe ſalute you worthye Senatours of Rome, which are conuented here in this Senate, &amp; I beſech the immortal gods my tong this day ſo to gouerne, that I may ſay that which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for my countrey, and that they helpe you others to gouerne well the common wealth. For wythout the healpe of God, we can neither learne the good, nor auoid the euill. The fatale deſtines permittinge it, and our wrathefull Gods forſakinge vs, our miſhappe was ſuche, &amp; to ye others fortune ſhewed her ſelf ſo fauourable: that the proud captaines of Rome, byforce of armes toke our countrey of <hi>Germany.</hi> And I ſaye not without a cauſe, that at that tyme the gods were diſpleaſed with vs: for if we Germaines had appeaſed our Gods, ye Romaynes might well haue excuſed your ſelues for ouercomminge of vs. Greate is youre glorye O Romaynes, for the victories ye haue had, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes whiche of manye realmes ye haue conquered: but notwithſtanding greater ſhall your infamy be in the worlde to come, for the cruelties whiche you haue committed. For I let you knowe, yf you do not knowe it, that when the wicked went before the triumphing chariots ſayeng, lyue, lyue, inuincyble Rome: on the other ſyde the poore captyues went ſayeng in theire hartes, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, iuſtice. My predeceſſours enhabited by the ryuer of <hi>Danubye,</hi> for when the drye earth annoyed them, they came to recreate them ſelues in the freſhe water: and if perchaunce the vnconſtant water dyd annoy them, then they woulde returne againe to the mayne lande. And as the appetites and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of men are variable: ſo there is a tyme to flye from the lande, to refreſhe our ſelues by the water. And tyme alſo when we are annoyed with the water
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21411:190"/>
to retourne agayne to the lande. But howe ſhall I ſpeake Romaynes, that whyche I woulde ſpeake? your couetouſenes of taking other mennes goods hath bene ſo extreme, &amp; your pryde of commaunding ſtraunge countreis hath bene ſo diſordinate: that neither the ſea can ſuffiſe you in the depenes thereof, neyther the lande aſſure vs in the fieldes of the ſame. O how great comforte it is for the troubled men, to think and be aſſured that there are iuſt gods, the which will do iuſtice on the vniuſt. For if the oppreſſed menne thought them ſelues not aſſured, that the gods would wreke their iniury of theire enemies: they with their owne handes woulde deſtroy them ſelues. The ende why I ſpeake this is, for ſo much as I hope in the iuſt gods, that as you others with out reaſon haue caſt vs out of our houſes: ſo by reaſon ſhal others come after vs, and caſt you others out of <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; Rome bothe. There in my countrey of <hi>Germany,</hi> we take it for a rule vnfallyble, that he whiche by force taketh the good of another: by reaſon ought to loſe his owne proper right. And I hope in the gods, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that which we haue for a prouerb in <hi>Germany,</hi> you ſhal haue for experience here in Rome. By the groſſe woordes I ſpeake, &amp; by the ſtrange apparell which I weare, you may well immagine that I am ſome rude v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine or barbarous borne: but yet notwithſtandinge I want not reaſon to know, who is iuſt and righteous in holdyng his owne: and who is a tyraunt in poſſeſſing of others. For the rude menne of my profeſſion, though in good ſtile they cannot declare that whiche they would vtter: yet notwithſtandinge that, we are not ignoraunt of that whiche ought to bee allowed for good, nor whiche ought to bee condemned for euill. I woulde ſaye therfore in this caſe, that that which the euyll with all their tiranny haue gathered in many daies, the gods ſhall take from them in one houre: and contrarywyſe all that which the good ſhall loſe in many yeres, the gods will ceſtore it them in one minute. For ſpeaking the trueth, the euill to proſper in ryches, is not for that the gods will it, but that they doe ſuffer it, and though at this houre we complaine diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, we ſuffer much, but the tyme ſhal come that will paye for all. Beliue me in one thing, O Romaynes, and doubt not therin: that of the vnlawfull gaine of the fathers, foloweth after the iuſt vndoing of their children. Manye often tymes doe marueile in my countrey, what the cauſe is that the gods doe not take from the wicked that which they winne, immediatlye as ſoone as they winne it: and as I think the reaſon hereof is, for the diſſembling with them, by lytle and little they gather together dyuers thinges, and afterwardes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they thinke leaſt thereon, it is taken from them all at once. For the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the gods is, that ſince without reaſon they haue done euyll to others: others by reaſon ſhould come in lyke maner which doe euyll vnto them. It is vnpoſſible that the valyant and ſage man, who in his deedes preſumeth to be wiſe, ſhould take any taſte in an other mans good: for if he dyd, he woulde neuer content him ſelfe with anye thinge, ſith he hath not a conſcience in that which is euil gotten, I know not Romaines, whether you vnderſtande mee, but becauſe you ſhall vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me better, I ſay, that I maruaile, &amp; I ſhould rather wonder, how the man keping another mans goods, can ſleepe or reſt one hour, ſith he knoweth he hath done iniury to the gods, ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered his neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bours, pleaſed his enemies, loſt his frendes, &amp; endomaged thoſe that he rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, &amp; woorſt of all that he hath put his perſonne in perill. And I ſaye, that he
<pb facs="tcp:21411:191"/>
hath put his perſon in peryl: for the day that any man determineth to take my goods, he wyl alſo the ſame day (if he can) take my lyfe. It is an odyous thing to the gods, and very ſlaunderous amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men, that men ſhould haue ſo much (thorough theire fleſhly deſyres) vertue bounde, and the raine of theire euill workes ſo much at lybertie, that another mans miſery ſeemeth to him riches, and that his owne riches ſemeth to hym ſelfe pouertie. I care not whether he be Greke, barbarous, Romaine, preſent or abſent, I ſay and affirme, that he is and ſhalbe curſed of gods and hated of men, whiche without conſideracion wil change his good fame into ſhame, iuſtice into wronge, right into tiranny, trouthe into lyes, the certaine for the doubtful, hatyng hys owne proper, and ſyghing for that of other mennes. He that hath his chiefe intencion to gather goods for his children, and ſeketh not a good name among the renowmed: it is iuſt that ſuch one doe not onely loſe the goods whych he hath gathered, but alſo that wythout good name he remaine ſhameful among the wicked. Since you other Romaines naturally are proud, &amp; pryde doth blynd you, you thinke your ſelues happy, that for hauing ſo much as ye haue more then others, that therfore you ſhould be more honored then al, the which truely is not ſo. For if preſently you wyl not open your eies &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe your own errors, you ſhal ſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wheras you auaunt your ſelues to be lords of ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge prouinces: you ſhal fynd yourſelues made ſlaues with your own proper goods. Gather aſmuch as you wyl, let them doe all you do commaund them: yet as I thynk it lytle auaileth to haue Plebeians houſes wyth goodes, and contrarywyſe the hartes to bee poſſeſſed wyth couetouſnes. For the ryches which are gotten with couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and are kept wyth auarice, doe take away the good name from the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſour, and do nothyng auaile to maintein his lyfe. It cannot be ſuffered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes, and much leſſe hidde many yeares, that one man ſhould be cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted bothe for riche among the ryche, and for honoured among the honorable: for it is vnpoſſible that he whych is a great louer of temporall goods, ſhould be a frynde of hys good name. O if the couetous men were of theire own honor as gredy, as they are of the goods of an other deſyrous: I ſwere vnto you by the immortall gods, that the lytle woorme or moth of couetouſnes would not gnawe the reſt of theyr lyfe, nor the canker of infamy ſhoulde deſtroy theyre good name after theire death. Herken you Romaynes, herken what I wyll ſaye, and I beſeche the gods that you may vnderſtande it: For otherwiſe I ſhould loſe my labour, and ye others ſhould take no fruite of my wordes. I ſe that all the worlde hateth pryde, &amp; yet there is none that will folow humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Euery man condemneth adultery, and yet I ſe no man that liueth chaſte. Euery man curſeth exceſſe, and I ſe no man lyue temperatly. Euery man praiſeth pacience, and I ſe no man that wyll ſuffer. Euerye manne blameth ſlouth, and I ſe no man, but thoſe that are ydel. Euery one blameth auaryce, and yet euery man robbeth. One thyng I ſaye, &amp; not wythout teares in thys ſenate, openly I doe declare it, whych is, that wyth the tonge euery man pray<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeth vertue: and yet they them ſelues with all their lymmes are ſeruants vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vyces. Do not thynke that I ſaye thys onely for the Romaynes whych be in <hi>Illiria:</hi> but for the Senatours whych I ſe here in the Senate. Al you Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, in your deuyſes about your armes, haue this for your word. <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum eſt debellare ſuperbos, &amp; parcere ſubiectis.</hi> Truelye you ſhoulde better

And if ye ſay vnto me Romaines that <hi>Germanie</hi> is not conquered of Rome for euer, but that onelye Rome ſhoulde haue the glorye to be miſtres of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye,</hi> this allſo I ſaye is vanitye and follye. For litle auaileth it to haue the forts and caſtels of the people: when the hartes of the inhabitauntes are abſente. If ye ſaye that therefore ye conquered <hi>Germany,</hi> to amplifie and enlarge the limittes and boundes of Rome, allſo mee thinkethe this as fooliſhe an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. For it is not the point of wiſe and valiaunt men to enlarge their dominy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and diminiſhe theire honour. If ye ſaye ye ſent to conquere vs, to the end we ſhoulde not be barbarous, nor liue like tirauntes, but that you woulde we ſhoulde liue after your good lawes and cuſtomes, yf it bee ſo I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. But how is it poſſyble ye ſhould geue laws to ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you break y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laws of your own <g ref="char:abpre">p̄</g>deceſſours? great ſhame ought they to haue, which take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to correct others, when they haue more nede to be corrected the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelfes.

For the blinde man ought not to take vppon him to leade the lame. If this be true (as preſently it is) what reaſon or occaſion had proude Rome, to take and conquere the innocent Germanye? Let vs all go therfore to robbe, to kyll, to conquere, and to ſpoile, ſins we ſee the worlde ſo corrupte, and ſo far from the loue of god, that euery man (as we may perceiue) taketh what hee ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, kylleth whom he will, and that which worſt of all is, that neither thoſe which gouerne wil remedy ſo many euils as are committed, neither thoſe which are offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded dare complaine. Ye chiefe iudges at this day are ſo harde to bee entreated, ye take ſo litle regard vnto the poore oppreſſed: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they think it more quiet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in trouble at home, then to come and put vp theire complaintes before you here at Rome. And the cauſe hereof is, that there in theire countrey theye haue but one which purſueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and here in this ſenate theye are euil willed of al, and that is, becauſe he which complaineth is poore, and the other whiche is complained on is riche. Therefore ſince fortune would it, and the fatall deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies permit it that the proude Rome ſhould be miſtreſſe of our Germanye, it is but reaſon ye ſhould kepe vs in iuſtice, and mainteine vs in peace. But you do not ſo, but rather thoſe which come thither do take from vs our goods, and ye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are here do rob vs of our good name, ſaying, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſince we are a people with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out law, without reaſon, &amp; without a king (as vnknowen barbarous) ye maye take vs for ſlaues. In this caſe ye Romains are greatly deceiued, for me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reaſon ye can not cal vs w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out reaſon, ſince we being ſuch as we are, and as the gods created vs, remaine in our proper countreis, without deſiring to ſeeke or inuade foreine realmes. For with more reaſon we mighte ſay, that ye were men withoute reaſon, beinge not contented w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſweete and fertyle Italye: but that throughe ſhedynge of bloude you ſhould deſire to conquere al the yearth. In y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye ſay we deſerue to be ſlaues, becauſe we haue no prince to commaund vs, nor ſenat to gouerne vs, nor army to defend vs, to this I wil aunſwere. That ſince we had no enemies, we neded no armies, &amp; ſith euery man is contented w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his lotte and fortune, we had no neceſſitie of a proude ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to gouerne vs, &amp; we being as we are all equall, it nede not we ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to haue anye princes amongeſt vs. For the office of princes is to ſuppreſſe tyrants, &amp; to mainteine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people in peace. If ye ſaye further y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue not in our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, nor pollicy, but that we liue as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brute beſts in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountaines, in this alſo you haue but ſmall reaſon.

                     <p>YE woulde thinke I haue ſaide al that I can ſay, but certainly it is not ſo. For there remaineth many things to ſpeak, which to heare ye will be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonied, yet be ye aſſured, that to ſpeak then I wil not be afrayed, ſith you others in doing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are not aſhamed. For an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offence, deſerueth not ſecret correction. I meruaile much at ye Romaines, what ye meaned to ſend vs (as you did) ſuch ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t iudges, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which by the imortal gods I ſweare, can ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare vs your lawes, &amp; much leſſe they can vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ours. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of al this euil is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not thoſe which be beſt able to miniſter to vs iuſtice in Germany, but thoſe which haue beſt frindes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you in Rome: preſuppoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to thoſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenat, ye geue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> office of cenſourſhip, more for importunitie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for abilitie. It is litle y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I can ſay here, in reſpect they dare do there. That whiche ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here, I know not but of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which they do there, I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, which is. Your iudges take all bribes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are brought vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly: and they powle &amp; ſhaue as much as they can ſecretly.

And being there to mitigate ſclaunders, theye are thoſe which are moſt ſclaunderous: &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out goods it auailethe no man to aſke iuſtice. And finally vnder the colour y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be iudges of Rome, they feare not to rob all the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Germany. What meanethe this ye Romaines, ſhall youre pride neuer haue end in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, nor your couetice in robbing? Say vnto vs what ye wil in words, but oppres vs not ſo in dedes.

For in our countrey we do not vſe as ye Romaines do, nor haue ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions as ye haue here in Rome. For you deſire to liue poore, becauſe ye deſyre to dye riche. If ye ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we wil rebel, I marueile what you ſhoulde meane to think ſo, ſith ye haue ſpoiled vs, robbed vs, &amp; handled vs yll. Aſſure me ye Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maines, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye wil not vnpeople vs: &amp; I wil aſſure you we wil not rebell. If our ſeruice do not contentye, ſtrike of our heads as to euil men. For (to tell ye the truth) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knife ſhal not be ſo fearful to our necks, as your tiranies be abhorred in our hartes.

It chaunſeth allſo, that oft times there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to complaine heare in the Senat, ſome flattering man more for malice, then by reaſon of right, or iuſtice: and ye Senatours crediting his double words, &amp; his fained teares, immediatlye or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein a Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſor to go &amp; geue audience on their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints.

I will declare vnto you mye life, O ye Romaines, &amp; therby ye ſhall ſe how they paſſe their life in my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. I liue by gathering akornes in the winter, &amp; reapinge corne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer, ſome time I fiſhe aſwell of neceſſitie, as of pleaſure, ſo that I paſſe allmoſte al my lyfe alone in the fieldes, or in the mountaines. And if you wote not whye, heare me, &amp; I wil ſhew you. I ſe ſuch tirranny in your iudges, &amp; ſuch robberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as they commit among the poore people, &amp; there are ſuch diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions in that realme, ſuch iniuries co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted therin, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth is ſo ſpoyled, there are ſo few that haue deſire to do good, and allſo there are ſo few that hope for remedy in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenate: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I am determined (as moſt vnhappy) to ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>niſhe my ſelfe out of mine owne houſe, &amp; to ſeperate my ſelfe from my ſwete company, to the end my eyes ſhould not behold ſo miſerable a chaunge. For I had rather wan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der ſolitarie in the fields, then to ſee my neighbours hourly lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtretes.

Without doubt it is a marueilous paine to ſuffer an ouerthrowe of fortune: but it is a greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when one felethe it without remedy. And yet witheoute compariſon my

greateſt griefe is, when my loſſe may be remedied, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he which may, wil not: &amp; he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil, can not by any meanes remedy it. O cruel Romains, ye fele nothyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we fele, ineſpecially I which ſpeake it, ye ſhal ſe how I fele it, ſince only to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duce it to memory my eies do daſell, my tongue wil waxe weary, my iointes do ſeuer, my hart doth tremble, my entrailes do breake, and my fleſh conſumeth, what a woful thing is it, in my countrey to ſe it with my eies, to heare it wyth my eares, &amp; to fele it with myne owne hands? Truly the griefes whiche y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Germany ſuffreth are ſuch, &amp; ſo many: that I beleue yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mercyful gods will haue compaſſion vpon vs. I wil not deſire ye to think ſclander of my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: but onely I do beſech ye, you wil vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wel what I ſay. For you yma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gining (as you doe preſume to be diſcrete) ſhal ſee right wel that the troubles which came to vs from men, &amp; among men, with men, &amp; by the hands of men: it is a ſmall mattery we as men do fele them ſpeaking. For according to the truth, &amp; alſo with liberty, if I ſhould declare euerye other iuſte aduertiſement which came from the ſenat, &amp; al the tyranny which your iudges co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit in the miſerable realme, one of theſe .2. thinges muſt enſue, either the puniſhment of me, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> depriuacion of your officers if I ſay true. One thing onely comforteth me, or whereof I with other infortunate people haue had experience, in that I think my ſelfe happy, to know that the iuſt plagues proceede not from the iuſte gods, but through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſt deſerts of wicked men: And that our ſecret fault doth waken thoſe, to the end that they of vs may execute open iuſtice. Of one thing only I am ſore troubled, becauſe the gods can not be contented, but for a ſmal fault, they puniſh a good man much: &amp; for many faultes, they puniſhe euill men nothing at all, ſo that the gods do beare with the one, &amp; forgeue nothinge vnto the other. O ſecret iudgements of god, that as I am bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to praiſe your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, ſo likewiſe if I had licence to condempne them, I durſt ſaye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye cauſe vs to ſuffer greuous paines, for that ye puniſh &amp; perſecute vs by the hands of ſuch iudges, the which (if iuſtice toke place in the world) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they chaſtiſe vs wyth their hands, they do not deſerue to haue their heades on theire ſhoulders. The cauſe why now again I do exclame on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> immortall gods, is to ſe, that in theſe 15. daies I haue bene at Rome, I haue ſene ſuch dedes done in your ſenat y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if the leaſt of them had ben done at <hi>Danuby,</hi> the gallows &amp; gibbets had ben ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I am determined to ſee your doings, to ſpeake of your diſhoneſty in apparell, your litle tempera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in eating, &amp; your diſorder in affaires, &amp; your pleaſures in liuing: and on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide, I ſee that when your prouiſion arriueth in our countrey, we cary into the temples, &amp; offer it to the gods, we put it on their heads: ſo that the one meting with the other, we accompliſh that which is commaunded, &amp; accurſe thoſe that commaunded. And ſith therfore my hart hath now ſene, that which it deſireth, my minde is at reſt, in ſpitting out the poyſon which in it abideth. If I haue in any thing here offended with my tongue, I am redy to make recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with my head. For in good faith I had rather winne honour, in offring my ſelfe to death: then ye ſhould haue it, in taking from me my life. And here the villayne ended his talke, immediatlye after <hi>Mar. Aur.</hi> ſaide to thoſe whiche were aboute him. How think ye my frindes, what kernell of a nut, what golde of the myne, what corne of ſtraw, what roſe of bryers, what mary of bones, &amp; how noble &amp; valiaunt a man hath he ſhewed him ſelfe?

By the faithe of a good man I ſweare, as I may be deliuered from this feuer which I haue: I ſawe this villaine ſtanding boldely a whole houre on his feete, &amp; al we beholdinge the earthe as amazed, coulde not aunſwere him one word. For in dede this villaine confuted vs with his purpoſe, &amp; aſtonied vs, to ſe the litle regarde he had of his life. The ſenate afterwardes, being al agreed, the next day folowing we prouided new iudges for the ryuer of <hi>Danuby,</hi> &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded the villaine to deliuer vs by writing, all that he had ſaide by mouth, to the end it might be regiſtred in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> booke of good ſaiyng of ſtraungers, which were in the ſenate. And further it was agreed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſaide villaine (for the wiſe wordes he ſpake) ſhould be choſen ſenatour, and of the free men of Rome he ſhould be one: and that for euer he ſhould be ſuſtay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon treaſour.

                     <head>¶That princes &amp; noble men oughte to be very circumſpect in choſinge iudges and offycers, for therein conſiſtethe the profyte of the publike weale, Cap. vi.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>ALexander</hi> the great (as the hiſtoriographers ſay) in his youth vſed hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting very much ſpecially of the mountains: &amp; that which is to be marueiled at, he would not hunt Deare, goats, hares, nor partriges: but Tigers, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdes, elephants, cocodrilles, and Lyons. So that this mighty prince did not onely ſhewe the excellency of his courage, in conqueringe proude princes: but alſo in chaſing of cruel, &amp; ſauage beaſts. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his Apothegmes ſaiethe: that the greate <hi>Alexander</hi> had a familiar ſeruaunt, named <hi>Crotherus,</hi> to whom often times he ſpake theſe words. I let the to know <hi>Crotherus,</hi> that the valya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t princes ought not only to be vpright in their realmes which they gouern: but alſo to be circumſpect in paſtimes which they vſe, that the auctoritie whiche in the one they haue wonne, in the other they do not loſe. When <hi>Alexander</hi> ſpake theſe wordes truely he was of more auctoritie then of yeares: But in the ende he gaue this example, more to be folowed, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, then to be reproued or blamed I ſaye to be folowed, not in the huntinge that he exercyſed: but in the great courage which he ſhewed. To the <hi>Plebeyans</hi> &amp; men of baſe condicion, it is a litle thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in one matter they ſhew their might, &amp; in other things theyre ſmall power is knowen: but to princes &amp; greate lordes it is a diſcommendable thing, that in earneſt matters any man ſhould accuſe them of pryde, &amp; in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſport, they ſhould count them for light. For the noble &amp; valiaunt Prince, in thinges of importaunce, ought to ſhew great wiſedome, &amp; in meane things, great ſtoutnes. The caſe was ſuch, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great, hunting on the wilde mountaines, by chaunce met with a cruel Lion, &amp; as the good Prince would wyn his honor with the Lion, &amp; alſo the Lion preſerue his own life, they were in griepes the one of the other ſo faſte, that bothe fell to the earthe, where they ſtriued almoſte halfe an houre, but in the ende the lyon remained there deade, and the hardye <hi>Alexander</hi> eſcaped all bloudye. This huntynge of <hi>Alexander</hi> and the Lyon thoroughe all <hi>Grece,</hi> was greatlye renowmed.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:195"/>
I ſay gretly renowmed, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grauers &amp; painters drew a pourtrait forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with in ſtone worke, of this huntinge, &amp; the grauers hereof were <hi>Liſippus,</hi> and <hi>Leocarcus,</hi> marueilous grauers of anuk workes, which they made of mettall, where they liuely ſet forth <hi>Alexander</hi> &amp; the Lion fighting, &amp; alſo a familiar ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of his named <hi>Crotherus,</hi> being among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dogges beholding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that the worke ſemed not onely to repreſent an au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient thing but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lyon, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, Crotherus,</hi> &amp; the dogges, ſemed alſo to be aliue in the ſame chaſe. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> fought with the Lyon, ther came an <hi>Embaſſatour</hi> from <hi>Sparthes</hi> to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who ſpake to <hi>Alexander</hi> theſe wordes. Woulde to god (immortall prince) that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force you haue vſed with the Lyon, in the mountain, you had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt ſome prince, for to be Lorde of the earth. By the wordes of the Embaſſatour, &amp; the deedes of <hi>Alexander,</hi> may eaſely by gathered, that as it is comly for Princes to be honeſt, valiaunt, and ſtout: ſo to the contrary it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemely for them to be bolde, and raſhe. For thoughe princes of their goodes be lyberall, yet of their lyfe they oughte not to be prodigall. The diuine <hi>Plato,</hi> in the tenth booke of his laws ſaieth, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> .2. renowmed Philoſophers of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi> whoſe names were <hi>Adon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Clinias</hi> fell at variaunce withe them ſelues, to know in what thing the prince is bound to aduenture his life, <hi>Clinias</hi> ſaid, that he ought to dye for any thing touching his honour. <hi>Adon</hi> ſaide the contrarye. That he ſhould not hazarde his life, vnles it were for maters touching the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the common wealth. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaieth, thoſe .2. philoſophers had reaſon in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſaide: but admit that occaſion to dye ſhoulde be offred the prince, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one, or the other: he ought rather to dye for that thing touching iuſtice, then for the thinge touchinge his honour. For there is no great difference, to dye more for the one, then for the other. Applying y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue ſpoken, to that we will ſpeake, I ſay, that we do not deſire, nor we wil not, that princes and greate lordes doe deſtroy them ſelues with Lions in the chaſe, neither aduenture their perſones in the warres, nor that they put their liues in peril for the common weale: but we only require them, that they take ſome paines and care to prouide for thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges belonging to iuſtice. For it is a more naturall hunting for princes, to hunt out the vicious of their common weales: then for to hunt the wilde bores, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thicke woodes. To the end princes accompliſh this which we haue ſpoken, we wil not aſke them time when they ought to eat, ſlepe, hunt, ſport &amp; recreate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues: but that of the foure and twenty houres that be in the daye and nyghte theye take it for a pleaſure and commoditie one houre to talke of iuſtice. The gouernement of the commonweale conſiſteth not, in that they ſhould trauaile vntil they ſweate, and moleſt theire bodies, ſhed theire bloude, ſhorten theire lyues, and loſe theire paſtimes: but all conſiſtethe, in that they ſhoulde be dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygent to forſee the domages of their common wealth, and likewiſe to prouy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de for good mynyſters of iuſtice. We doe not demaunde Prynces and greate lordes, to geue vs theire goodes, nor we forbydde them not to eate, to forſake ſlepe, to ſporte, to hunte, nor to putte theire lyues in daunger: but we deſyre and beſeeche them, that theye prouyde good mynyſters of iuſtice for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthe.</p>
                     <p>Firſte they oughte to be very dyligente to ſerche them oute, and afterwards to be more circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpect to examine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for if we ſighe withe teares to haue good Prynces, we oughte muche more to praye that wee haue not euill offycers.

What profiteth it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince be carefull, &amp; vertuous, if the iudge be negligent and vicious? finally I ſay, that it lytel auaileth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince in his houſe be ſecretly iuſt, if adioyning to that, he truſt a tiraunt &amp; open theſe with the gouernement of the common weale. Princes and great Lordes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are within their pallaces at pleaſure, theire myndes occupyed in hyghe things, do not receiue into their ſecreat companye, but their entier frindes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time they wil not, but occupy them ſelues in paſtimes and pleaſure: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they know not what they haue to amend in their ꝑſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; much leſſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whych they ought to remedy in their common weales. I will not be ſo eger in repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, neither ſo ſatirycal in writing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould ſeme I would perſwade Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that theye liue not accordinge to the highneſſe of theire eſtates: but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to the life of the religious. For if theye will keepe them ſelues from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge tyrauntes, or beinge outragiouſlye vicious: we cannot denay them ſome times to take theire pleaſures. But mye intention is not, ſo ſtrayghtelye to commaunde Princes to be iuſte: but onelye to ſhewe them howe theye are bounde to doe iuſtice. Common wealthes are not loſte, for that their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces liue in pleaſure: but becauſe they haue lytel care of iuſtice. In the ende peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple doe not murmure when the Prince dothe recreat his perſon: but when he is to ſlacke to cauſe iuſtice to be executed. I would to GOD, that Princes toke an accompte withe godde, in the thynges of theire conſcience, touchynge the common wealthe: as theye doe withe men, touchynge theire rentes and reuenewes. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in an Epiſtle hee wrate to Traiayne the Emperoure, ſayethe: it pleaſethe me verye well, moſte puiſſaunte Prince, that the Prynce be ſuche one, as all maye ſaye that in hym there is nothynge worthye of repre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>henſion: butte addynge thereunto, it dyſpleaſethe mee muche more that he ſhoulde haue ſo euill iudges, that all ſhoulde ſaye, in them were nothinge wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye of commendacion. For the faultes of Prynces verye well maye bee excuſed: butte the offences of the officers, can by noe meanes bee endured. Manye Prynces and greate Lordes deceiue them ſelues, in thynkynge that theye doe theire dutye, in that theye bee vertuous in theire perſonnes, but it is not ſo: For it ſuffyſethe not a Prynce to drawe vnto hym all vertues, butte allſo he is bounde to roote all vices oute of the common wealthe.</p>
                     <p>Admitte that Princes will not, or of them ſelues cannot gouerne the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthe: yet let vs deſire and admonyſhe them, to ſeeke good offycers to doe it for them. For the poore Plebeian hathe noe accompte to render, but of hys good or euill lyfe: butte the Prynce ſhall render accompte, of hys vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious lyfe whiche hee hathe ledde, and of the lytle care that hee hath had of hys common wealthe.</p>

                        <hi>Seneca</hi> in an epiſtle he wrote to a frinde of his named <hi>Lucilla</hi> ſayeth. My dere frend <hi>Lucilla,</hi> I would gladly thou wouldeſt come &amp; ſee me here in Rome: but I pray thee reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend to good iudges y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ile of <hi>Scicile.</hi> For I would not deſire to enioy thy ſight, if through my occaſion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhouldeſt leaue the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealthe out of order. And to the entent thou mayeſt knowe what condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they ought to haue, whom thou ſhouldeſt choſe for gouernours or iudges: I will let thee vnderſtand, that they ought to be graue in theire ſentences, iuſt in theire wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, honeſt in their workes, mercyfull in their iuſtice, and aboue all, not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with bribes. And if I do aduertiſe thee of this, it is becauſe if thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt take care to gouerne thy common wealth well, thou ſhouldeſt now be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect to examine them, to whom preſently thou muſt recommende the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement therof. I woulde ſaye afterwardes, that all that whiche the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyent Phyloſophers haue written in manye bookes, and haue lefte by dyuers ſentences, <hi>Seneca</hi> dyd reherſe in theſe fewe woordes: the whiche are ſo graue, and neceſſarie, that if Princes reteyned them in their memorie to put them in execucion, and iudges had them before their eyes for to accompliſh them, they woulde excuſe the common wealthe of dyuers ſlaunders, and theye ſhoulde allſo delyuer them ſelues from a great burdeyn of theire conſcience.</p>
                     <p>It is not a thinge voluntarye, butte neceſſarie, that the mynyſters of iuſtice be vertuous, well eſtabliſhed, and verye honeſt: For to Iudges nothynge can be more ſlaunderous, and hurtefull, then when theye ſhoulde reprooue yonge men of theire youthe, others maye iuſtlye reprehende them of theyre lyghtnes. He which hath a publike offyce in the common wealthe, and ſytteth openlye to iudge therein, oughte to obſerue a good order in hys perſone, leaſt he be noted dyſolute in hys doynge: For the Iudge whiche is wythoute ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtye, and conſideracion, oughte to conſider wyth hym ſelfe, that if he alone haue aucthoritie to iudge of other mens goodes, that there are a thouſande whyche wyll iudge of hys lyfe. It is not onelye a bourden of conſcience, to Princes to commit the charge of gouernaunce of the people to dyſſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones: but alſo it is a greate contempt, and dyſprayſe of Iuſtice. For the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce geeuen of hym who deſerueth to be iudged, is among the people litel eſtemed. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in hys <hi>Apothegmes</hi> ſayethe, that Phillyppe kynge of <hi>Macedony,</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the greate <hi>Alexander,</hi> created for iudge of a prouince a freende of his, whoe after he ſawe him ſelfe in ſuche offyce, occupyed hym ſelfe more in kem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge hys heade, then in woorkynge or ſtudyinge hys bookes. Kynge Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyppe beynge enfourmed of the vanytye and inſolencye of thys iudge, reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the power whyche he hadde geeuen hym, and when he complayned to all of the wronge and griefe whyche was done vnto hym, takyng hys office from hym, Kynge Phyllippe ſayed vnto hym. If I hadde geuen the office to thee, for none other cauſe but beinge my friende, beeleue mee that nothinge in the worlde coulde haue ſuffyſed to haue taken it from thee: beecauſe I louynge thee ſo entierlye as I dyd, reaſon woulde not I ſhoulde haue depriued thee of this office, wherewith I honoured thee. I gaue thee thys office, thinkyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wert vertuous, ſage, honeſt, and allſo a man well occupyed, and mee thynkethe thou rather occupyeſt thy ſelfe in beeholdynge thye perſone, then in gouerninge well my common wealthe: whyche thou oughteſt not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto, and muche leſſe doe in dede. For the iudge oughte to be ſo occupyed,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21411:196"/>
in the adminiſtracion of the common wealth: that he ſhoulde haue noe leyſure at anye tyme to keame his heade. Theſe wordes the good king Phillip ſpake vnto the iudge, whom he dyſplaced of his office, for beeynge to fyne and dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in keamynge hys heade, and trymmynge his perſone. It is not onelye decent for miniſters of iuſtice, to be graue, and honeſt: but allſo it behouethe them to be true, and faithefull. For to a iudge whoſe offyce is to iudge the truethe, there can be noe greater infamye: then to be counted a lyer. When two Plebeians be at variaunce togethers for one thinge, they come beefore the iudge for noughte els, but that hee ſhoulde iudge whoe hathe righte and iuſtice thereunto. Therefore if ſuche a iudge bee not counted true, but a lyer, all take his iudgement for falſe: ſo that if the plainetife hathe noe more power, he wyll obeye iuſtice, yet at the leaſte he wyll blaſpheme hym that gaue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. There are ſome iudges, that preſentlye to gette more moneye, to drawe vnto them moe friendes, and to contynewe allſo in their offyces, vſe ſuche ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefull ſhiftes with the poore plainetifes, and take ſo large brybes of the defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt: that bothe parties are by hym ſelfe aſſured of the ſentence in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure, before he come vnto the barre. Manye goe to the houſes of iudges, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to demaunde, others to geue inſtructions, other to woorke deceite, others to importune them, others to wynne them, but fewe goe to vyſyte them: ſo that for thoſe &amp; ſuch ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blables, I do aduiſe, and admoniſhe offycers, that theye be iuſte in theire ſentences, and vprighte in theire woordes.</p>
                     <p>The mynyſters of iuſtice oughte to be ſuche, and ſo good, that in theire lyfe no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thynge be woorthye of rebuke: neyther in their wordes, anye thinge worthye of reproche. For if herein theye be not verye circumſpect, oftentymes that ſhal happen whiche the goddes woulde not, whiche is that to the preiudice of the iuſtice of another, he ſhall denye the worde of hym ſelfe. It ſuffyſethe not iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to bee true in theire wordes: butte it is verye neceſſarye that theye bee vpryghte in theire ſentences. That is to wete, that for loue theye bee not to large, neither for couetuouſneſſe theye ſhoulde be corrupted, nor for feare dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen backe, nor wythe prayours to be flattered, nor withe promyſſes blynded: for otherwiſe, it were a greate ſhame and inconuenience, that the yarde whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che theye carye in theire handes ſhoulde be ſtreyghte, and the lyfe whyche theye leade ſhoulde bee verye crooked. To the ende iuſtices be vprighte, they oughte muche to trauaile to be lyberall: I meane in thinges wherein theye ought to geeue ſentence. It is vnpoſſible that thoſe whiche haue reſpecte in theire ſentence to fauoure their friendes, ſhoulde not accuſtomablye vſe to be reuenged of their enemies. Trulye ſuche a iudge ought not to be counted iuſt: but a pryuate Tiraunte. He that withe affeccion iudgethe, and paſſyon pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth is greatlye deceyued. Thoſe inlyke manner whyche haue aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to gouerne, and doe thynke that for borrowynge a lytle of iuſtice theye ſhoulde therebye encreaſe, and multyplye frendes in the common wealthe, are muche abuſed: for thys acte beefore menne is ſo heinous, and beefore godde ſo deteſtable, that thoughe for a ſpace he refrayne hys handes, yet in the ende he will extende his power. For the redemer of the worlde, onelye fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of trueth, will not permit that ſuche doe take vppon them the title of iuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice which in their offices do ſhew ſo extreme wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. <hi>Helius Spartianus</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyfe of <hi>Antonius</hi> ſayethe, that the good Emperoure going to vyſite hys Empyre

For when I dyd deſire him, I thought nothing leſſe then to obtein the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but onely for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentacion of thoſe whiche inſtauntlye deſired me to do it. And further this <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puan</hi> ſayed. By the GOD <hi>Genius,</hi> I ſwere likewiſe, that I was not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more fryndely vnto him, for that hee ſayde he did it for mye ſake, more then for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: for he that to me would graunt theſe foure, it is to be beleued that to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he would graunt foure hundreth. For the whiche thou oughteſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyde, moſt noble Prince, becauſe good iudges oughte to be pacient to heare, &amp; iuſt to determine. By this notable example, iudges ought to haue a great reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecte, not to thoſe which do deſire them: but to that which theye demaund. For in doing their dutie, their enemies will proclaime them iuſt: and contrarywiſe if they doe that they ſhoulde not doe, theire nereſt freendes wil count them ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes. Iudges which pretend fauour to the common wealth, &amp; to be carefull of their conſciences, oughte not to content them ſelues ſimply to do iuſtice: but that of them ſelues they ſhould haue ſuche an oppinion, that none durſt preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to come and require at their hands, any vile or diſhoneſt thing. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if we note the demander to be vnſhamefaſt: we muſte nedes ſomewhat ſuſpecte the iudge in his iuſtice. Princes ought alſo to be very circumſpect, that the iudges be not only contented to bee iuſt, honeſt, and true: but alſo in them there ought to remaine no auarice, nor couetouſnes. For iuſtice, &amp; auarice, can ſeldome dwell in one houſe. Thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue the charge of the gouernement of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, &amp; to iudge cauſes, ought to take great hede, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bribes and preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes they be not corrupted: for it is vnpoſſible but that the ſame day, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> riches &amp; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoures in the houſes of iudges begin to encreaſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſelfe ſame day the admi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſtration of iuſtice, ſhould not decay. <hi>Licurgus, Prometheus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> did prohibite nothing in their law ſo muche, neither for anye other cauſe theye ordeyned ſo greauous puniſhments: but to thintent iudges ſhould not be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous, nor yet theues. And of trueth they had great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideracion, to fore ſee &amp; forbyd it: for the iudge that hath receaued parte of the theft, wil not geue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the ſtealers thereof. Let not iudges be credyted for ſaying they receiue no ſiluer, nor golde, neyther ſilkes, nor iewels, but that they take onely ſmall preſentes, as fruites, foule, and other trifles.</p>
                     <p>For oftentimes it chaunſeth, that the iudges doe eate the fruite, and the poore ſuter doth fele the morſell. <hi>Cicero</hi> in the booke of lawes ſayethe that <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſour being very aged, the Senatour ſayed vnto him one day in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Thou knoweſt now <hi>Cato,</hi> that preſentlye we are in the Calendes of Ia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nuarie, wherein we vſe to deuide the offices amonge the people. Wherefore we haue determined to create <hi>Manlius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Calidanus</hi> Cenſours for this yeare: wherefore tell vs if they be (as thou thinkeſt) able and ſufficient to ſupply that rome. <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſour aunſwered them in this wiſe. Fathers conſcripte, I
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21411:197"/>
let you were that I doe not receiue the one, nor admit the other. For <hi>Manlius</hi> is very riche, and <hi>Calidanus</hi> the citizeine extreame poore, and truely in bothe there is greate perill. For we ſee by experience that the riche officers are to muche ſubiect to pleaſures: and the poore officers are to muche geuen to aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryce. And further he ſaide in this caſe, me thinketh that your Iudges whom ye ought to chooſe, ſhould not be ſo extreame poore, that they ſhoulde wante wherewith to eate: neither ſo riche, that they ſhoulde ſurmount in ſuperfluity, to geeue them ſelues to muche to pleaſures. For menne by greate aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce, become vicious: and by great ſcarſitie become couetous. The Cenſor <hi>Cato</hi> being of ſuche aucthoritie, it is but reaſon that wee geeue credite to his woords, ſince he gouerned the romaine Empire ſo long ſpace, though indede all the poore be not couetous, nor all the riche vicious: yet hee ſpake it for ſhys intent, becauſe bothe thoſe Romaynes were noted of theſe ii. vices. For the poore deſire to ſcrape and ſcratche: and the riche to enioye and kepe. Whiche of thoſe twoe ſortes of men princes ſhould choſe. I cannot, nor dare not raſhely determine. And therefore I doe not counſaile them, either to deſpiſe the poore or to chooſe the riche: but that they geue the auctoritie of iuſtice to thoſe, whom they knowe to be of good conſcience, and not ſubiect to couetouſnes. For the iudge whoſe conſcience is corrupted, it is vnpoſſible he ſhould miniſter equall iuſtice. A man maye geue a ſhrewed geſſe of ſuſpicion in that iudge, whether he be of a britell conſcience, or no yf he ſee him procure the office of iuſtice for him ſelfe. For that manne whiche willinglye procureth the charge of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of another: commonlye lyttle regardeth the burthen of his owne.</p>

                        <hi>MArcus Aurelius,</hi> companion in the empire, tribune of the people, preſent lye being ſicke, wiſſheth vnto thee <hi>Antigonus,</hi> healthe and comforte in thy baniſhement. To flye the extreame heate of Rome, and to reade ſome bookes which are brought me, from the realme of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> I am come hether to <hi>Capua:</hi> and forthe haſte I made to ryde greate iourneis, the ague hath ouertaken mee, whiche is more troubleſome, then perillous. For it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me wyth colde, and plucketh my appetite from me. The .20. daye of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary I receiued thy ſecond letter, and it hapned that thy letter and my feuer tooke me bothe at one inſtaunt: but the feuer greued me in ſuche wiſe, that I coulde not longe endure to reade thy letter. Mee thinketh we haue no ſtaye nor meane, thou being ſo briefe, and I ſo longe: for my longe letter hath taken thy greauous ſorowes from the, but thy ſhorte letter coulde not take my feuer from me. Now that my mynd is beating of thy trauaile, the deſire whyche I haue to remedy it is enflamed. I woulde tell the one thinge, and ſuccour thee with ſome counſaile: but I fynde that the conſolation whiche thou wanteſt, I cannot geue the, and that whiche I can geue the, thou nedeſt not. In this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhal not be written that which was in the firſte: but herein I will trauaile the beſt I can to aunſwere thee.

If perhappes this letter bee not ſauory, ſo compendious, neither ſo comfortable as thoſe which I was woaſe to write vnto thee: attribute not the blame vnto my good will, which deſireth to ſerue the, but to the ſickenes that geueth no place thereunto. For it ſuffiſeth the ſicke to be contented with medecynes, without ſatiſfyinge theire fryndes. If thy comfort conſiſted in writing many letters, &amp; offering the many worde: truelye I woulde not ſticke to doe that for all my feuer. But it neither profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the, nor ſatiſfieth me, ſince I haue lyttle, to profer the muche. Talkinge nowe of this matter, I doe remember that the auncient lawes of the Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſaide theſe wordes. Wee deſire &amp; admoniſhe all menne, to viſite the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, the pilgrimes, and the comfortleſſe: and further, we ordeine &amp; comaund, that none in the common wealth be ſo hardye to geue counſaile, vnleſſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he geue remedy. For to the troubled harte wordes comforteth litle, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in them there is no remedye. Of a truthe the lawe of the Rhodians is good, &amp; the Romaine whiche ſhall obſerue them much better. Aſſure thy ſelf that I am very deſirous to ſee thee: &amp; alſo I knowe that thou wouldeſte as gladlye ſpeake vnto me, to recount me all thy griefes. Truelye I doe not meruayle, becauſe the wounded hart quieteth him ſelf more, declaring his owne griefes, then hearinge another mannes conſolations. Thou writeſt vnto mee of ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye thinges in thy letter, the effecte whereof, that thou certifieſt mee, is that the iudges and officers in that realme be verye rygorous, and extreame: and that therefore the <hi>Cicilians</hi> are greatlye diſpleaſed with the Senate.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto thou haſt neuer tolde me lye, the whiche moueth mee to beleue all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou writeſt nowe in thy letter. Wherefore I take it for a thinge moſte true: that for aſmuch as all thoſe of <hi>Cicil</hi> are malicious and enuyous, they geue the iudges iuſt occaſion to be cruell. For it is a generall rule, where men are out of order, the miniſters of iuſtice ought to be rygorous. And thoughe in other realmes it chaunſed not, it is to be beleued that it is true in this realme: wher of the auncient prouerbe ſaieth. All thoſe whiche enhabite the Iles are euill: but the <hi>Cicillians</hi> are worſte of all. At this daye the wicked are ſo mightye in theire malices, and the good are ſo much diminiſhed in theire vertues: that if by iuſtyce there were not a brydel, the wicked woulde ſurmount all the world, and the good ſhoulde vaniſhe immediatlye.</p>
                     <p>But retourninge to our matter I ſaye, that conſideringe with what and howe manye euylles we are enuiroined, and to howe manye miſeries wee are ſubiecte: I doe not meruaile at the vanities that menne committe, but I am aſhamed of the crueltie whiche our iudges execute. So that we maye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther call them tyrauntes, which kill by violence: then iudges which miniſter by iuſtice. Of one thing I was greatly aſtonyed, and almoſt paſt my ſence, which is, that iuſtice of right perteineth to the gods, and they being offended wil bee called pitifull: &amp; wee others borowe iuſtice, and not being offended, do glorifie our ſelues to be called cruell. I knowe not what manne wil hurte an other, ſince we ſee that the gods forgeuing theire proper iniuries, haue attained the renowme of mercifull, and we others puniſhinge the iniuries done vnto an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doe remaine with the name of tyrauntes. If the puniſhment of the gods were ſo ſeuere, as our ſinnes are filthye, &amp; that they ſhoulde meaſure vs wyth this meaſure: the onely deſert of one offence is ſufficient to take life from vs.</p>

If a man beholde him ſelfe from toppe to toe, he ſhal finde not one thinge in him to moue him to crueltie: but he ſhall ſee in him many inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes to exerciſe mercye. For he hath his eyes, wherewith hee ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the neady and indigent: he hath feete to goe to the church and ſermons: hee hath handes to helpe all: he hath his tongue to fauoure the <hi>Orphane:</hi> hee hath a harte to loue god: and to conclude, he hath vnderſtanding to know the euyll: and diſcretion to followe the good. If menne owe much to the goddes, for geuinge them theſe inſtrumentes to bee pitifull: truelye they are bounde no leſſe vnto them, for takinge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them all occaſions to be cruell. For he hath not geuen them hornes, as to bulles, neither nayles as to the catte, nor yet he hath geuen them poyſon, as to the ſerpent: Fynallye, he hath not geeuen them ſo perilous feete, as to a horſe to ſtrike, nor he hath geeuen them ſuch bloudye teethe, as to the Lyon to byte.

                     <p>BY the faith of a good manne I ſwere vnto thee frende <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that I being yong, knewe a iudge in Rome whoſe name was <hi>Lycaronicus</hi> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hygh ſtature, his fleſh neither to fatte, nor to leane, his eyes were ſome what bloudye and redde, he was of the lynage of the Senatours, and on hys face he had but a little bearde, and on his heade he had manye whyte heares. This <hi>Licaronicus</hi> of long tyme was iudge in Rome, in the romaine lawes he was well learned, and in cuſtomes and policies very experte, of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he ſpake lyttle, and in the aunſwers he gaue, he was verye reſolute. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt all thoſe which were in Rome in his tyme, he hadde this excellencye, whiche was, that to all he miniſtred equall iuſtice: and to ſuters with greate ſpeede he gaue briefe expedition, and diſpatched them immediatlye. They coulde neuer withdrawe him by requeſtes, neuer corrupt him with giftes, nor begyle him with wordes, nor feare him with threatninges, neither would he receiue a brybe of anye that did offer it him: And beſydes this, hee was verye ſeuere in condicion, churlyſhe in wordes, vnflectible in requeſtes, cruell in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhementes, ſuſpitious in affaires, and aboue all, he was hated of many, and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:199"/>
feared of all. How muche this <hi>Lycaronicus</hi> was hated it cannot bee reported, and of howe manye he was feared, no man can thinke. For in Rome when anye man was iniuried hee ſaide: I praye god that <hi>Licaronicus</hi> may liue lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. When the children did crye, the mothers immediatlye ſaide vnto them. Take heede of <hi>Lycaronicus,</hi> and ſtreight waye they helde theire peace: ſo that wyth the onelye name of <hi>Lycaronicus</hi> menne were aſtonied, and chyldren kepte ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Thou oughteſt alſo to knowe <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that when anye commotyon dyd aryſe in a citye, or in anye other prouince, or that anye ſclaunder roſe and encreaſed therein, they were wel aſſured, and they ſaide that no other ſhoulde goe thither, but onelye <hi>Lycaronicus.</hi> And to ſaye the truthe, when hee was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryued at that citie or prouynce, the rebelles were not onelye fledde: but alſo dyuers innocentes were for feare of his crueltye hyd. For <hi>Lycaronicus</hi> was ſo reſolute a parſonne, that ſome for yll factes, others for conſentinge, ſome for that they fauoured not the good right, others for that they kept them ſecrete: none eſcaped to be tormented of his parſonne, or punyſhed in goodes. Thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou <hi>Antigonus</hi> that they haue beene fewe whom this Iudge hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee whipte and carted, caſt into welles, beheaded, taken, baniſhed, and put in the ſtockes, during the tyme that the Romaines hadde him with them? By the immortall gods I ſwere vnto thee, and as <hi>Genius</hi> the god of nature maye helpe mee, that the gallouſes and gibbets were ſo furniſhed with feete, handes, and heades of menne, as the ſhambles were with oxen, ſheepe, and kyddes. This <hi>Lycaronicus</hi> was ſo fleſhely to ſhed humain bloud, that he was neuer ſo conuerſant nor had ſo merye a countenaunce: as the ſame daye hee ſhoulde cauſe any manne to be drowned in Tyber, hanged in mount <hi>Celio,</hi> be headed in the ſtrete <hi>Salario,</hi> tormented or caſt into the priſon <hi>Marmortina:</hi> O cruell, o fyerſe, and vnſpeakable condition that this iudge <hi>Lycaronicus</hi> hadde. For it was not poſſible that he ſhoulde bee brought vp betweene the delicate armes of the Romaines: but in the vile intrailes of you venemous ſerpents. I retourne ones more to ſaye, that it is vnpoſſible he ſhoulde be noriſhed with the delicate milke of women: but with the cruell bloude of <hi>Tigres.</hi> If thys <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caronicus</hi> were cruell, why did they geue him ſuche aucthoritie? I curſe ſuche auctoritie. If he did it for that he had greate zeale to iuſtyce: I curſe ſuch zeale of iuſtice. If hee did it to winne more honour, I curſe that honour: for that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe curſed of the gods and hated of menne, which taketh life from others, thoughe it bee by iuſtice, onelye to encreaſe his renowne.</p>
                     <p>The gods are muche offended and the people greatly domaged, where the <hi>Senate</hi> of Rome calleth that Iudge gentle whiche is corrupted: and him that is cruell iuſte, So that nowe amongeſt the Romayne people, thoſe whiche heale with oyle are not credited: but thoſe onelye whiche cure with fyre. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man thinke it, at the leaſte I doe not thynk it, that when <hi>Licaronicus</hi> died, all the cruell iudges dyd ende with hym: For throughe all the Romayne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire there was no more but one <hi>Licaronicus,</hi> and at thys preſente there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue .iii. or .iiii. in euerye common wealth.</p>
                     <p>Notwithout teares I ſpeake that whiche I will ſpeake, whiche is, that in thoſe daies as all the iudges that miniſtred were pitifull: ſo was this <hi>Lycaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> renowmed for cruell. But nowe ſynce all are cruell, we hope in a iudge which is pitefull. In the .xii. yere of the foundacion of our mother Rome, the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21411:199"/>
firſt king therof was <hi>Romulus,</hi> who ſent a commaundement to al the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and inhabitants there aboutes, to the end that all baniſhed menne, all thoſe whiche were afflicted, all thoſe which were perſecuted, &amp; all thoſe whiche were in neceſſitie ſhoulde come to Rome, for they ſhoulde bee defended from their enemies, and ſuccoured in theire neceſſities. The fame being ſpred tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout Italy, of the pitie and clemency whiche <hi>Romulus</hi> ſhewed in Rome (if the Anualles of the auncientes do not deceiue vs) Rome was more peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with inhabitauntes in .x. yeares, then <hi>Babilon</hi> or <hi>Carthage,</hi> in a hundred. O noble harte of <hi>Romulus,</hi> which ſuch thinges inuented: bleſſed be that tong, which commaunded that the famouſe Rome with clemency and pitie ſhould be founded. In the originall bookes whiche were in the high capitoll once I founde dyuers letters written, to the ſacred ſenate and romayne people, and in the beginning of the letters the wordes ſaide thus. We the king of <hi>Parthes</hi> in Aſya, to the fathers conſcripte of Rome, and to the happye romaine people of Italie, and to all thoſe whiche with the Romayne ſenate are confederate, whyche haue the name of Romaynes, and the renoume of clemencye, health and tranquillitie to your perſonnes we doe ſende you, and deſyre the ſame of the gods for our ſelues. Beholde therefore <hi>Antigonus,</hi> what tytles of clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye had our fyrſt Romaines, and what example of clemencye dyd the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour leaue for them to come: ſo that ſynce the barbarous ſtraungers called them pitifull: it is not to be beleued, that to theire ſubiects or natural countrey menne they were cruell. As the auncientes haue trauailed of al to be beloued, ſo they at this preſent throughe theire cruelties, ſeeke nothing but to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. If the gods perhaps ſhould reuyue the dead, and ſhould compare the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge before them in iudgement: I ſuppoſe they would ſay theſe are not their children, but theire enemies, not encreſers of the common wealth, but deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers of the people.</p>
                     <p>I being xxxvii. yeres of age, laye in winter ſeaſon in an yle called <hi>Chetyn,</hi> whiche nowe is called <hi>Cipres,</hi> wherin is a lytle mountaine as yet ful of wood, whiche is called mounte of <hi>Archady,</hi> where groweth an herbe called <hi>Ilabia,</hi> whiche the auncientes ſaye, that if it be cut it droppeth bloude: and the nature of it is, that if one rubbe any manne with the bloud therof hoate (although he woulde not) yet he ſhal loue him, and if they annoynt him with the bloud that is colde, he ſhall hate him.</p>
                     <p>Of this herbe we neede not doubte any thinge at all, for I dyd proue it, and noynted one with that bloud, who ſooner loſt his lyfe then the loue whiche he bare me.

                     <p>NEyther for that which I write in this letter, nor yet for that which king <hi>Cirus</hi> had in his graue: my entencion is not to defende the euill, to the ende that for theire euyll deedes, and outragiouſnes, they ſhould not be puniſhed. For by this meanes, it ſhoulde be worſe for me to fauour them: then for them to be euill. For they through debilitie do offende: and I by malyce do erre. But in this caſe it ſemeth vnto mee, and to all others whiche are of good iudgement, that ſince frailtie in men is natural, and the puniſhement whiche they geeue is voluntarye: Let iudges therefore in miniſtring iuſtice ſhewe, that they do it for the zeale of the common wealthe, and not with a mynde to reuenge. To the ende the faultye maye haue occaſion to amende the faultes paſt, and not to reuenge iniuries preſent, the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the bookes of his common wealth ſaide, that iudges ought to haue two things alwaies preſent before their eyes, that is to wete, that in iudging thinges touching the goodes of others, they ſhewe no couetouſnes: and in puniſhing anye man, they ſhewe no reuenge. For iudges haue lycence to chaſtice the bodye: but therefore they

Certaynly the Emperour <hi>Nero,</hi> for ſpeking ſuch a pitifull worde at that tyme, deſerued immortall memorie: but afterwardes his ſo cruell lyfe, peruerted ſo notable a ſentence.</p>
                     <p>For ſpeaking y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cruche, one euil worke ſuffiſeth to deface many good words. O how manye realmes and countreys haue beene loſte, not ſo muche for the euilles whyche in thoſe the wicked haue committed: as for the diſordinate Iuſtices whyche the miniſters of iuſtice therein haue executed.</p>
                     <p>For they thinkinge by rigour to correct the dommages paſt, haue raiſed vp preſent ſclaunder for euer. It is knowen to al men, who and what the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> hath beene, whoe in all his doinges was exceadinge good: For he was noble, valyaunt, ſtoute, fyerſe, and a louer of iuſtice, and aboue all verye pitiefull. And for ſo muche as in other thinges he ſhewed his pitye and clemency, he ordained, that no prince ſhould ſubſcribe iudgementes of deathe with his owne hande, neyther that he ſhoulde ſee iuyſtce done of anye wyth hys owne eyes. Truelye the lawe was pitifullye ordeyned, and for the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and purenes of Emperours verye neceſſarye.</p>
                     <p>For it ſemeth better for Prynces to defende theire lande with the ſharpe ſworde: then to ſubſcribe a ſentence of deathe, with the cruell penne. Thys good Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was verye diligent to chooſe miniſters of iuſtyce, and verye carefull to teache them howe they ſhoulde behaue them ſelues in the common wealth: admoniſhing them not onely of that they had to doe, but alſo of that they ought to flye. For the myniſters of iuſtyce, oftentymes ſayle of theire dutye. In <hi>Capua</hi> there was a gouernour named <hi>Eſcaurus,</hi> who was a iuſte iudge, thoughe he were ſomewhat ſeuere: whome the Emperour <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> ſent to the realme of Dace to take charge of that prouince.

I counſaile thee therefore, I doe deſire thee, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I commaunde thee, that thou chaunge thy trade of lyfe, and haue great reſpecte to my honour, and good name.</p>
                     <p>For thou knoweſt right well, that the onelye profite and honour of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of Romayne Princes, conſyſteth in hauinge good or euyll mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of theire iuſtyce.

This was the inſtruccion whiche the emperour Auguſtus gaue to the gouernour <hi>Eſcaurus.</hi> And if a man wil conſider &amp; way his words wel, he ſhal ſynde them compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious enough, that I would they were written in our iudges hartes. By thy letter thou declareſt that the iudges whom the Senate ſent to that Ile, are not very honeſt, nor yet without ſome ſuſpicion of couetouſnes. O wofull co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, where the iudges therofare cruell, diſhoneſt, &amp; couetous: forthe cruell iudges ſeeke nought elles but the bloude of innocentes, they couet the goods of the poore, &amp; they ſclaunder the good, to ſuche &amp; ſo wicked a common welth, I would ſaye that it were better to remaine in the mountains among the brute beſtes: then by ſuch vniuſt iudges to be gouerned in a como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth. For the firce Lyons (which of all beaſts are moſte cruell) if in his preſens the hunter proſtrate him ſelf on the earth before him, the Lyon wil neither touch him nor his garment. O my frinde <hi>Antigonus,</hi> doſt thou thinke that if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welth be vnhappy which hath ſuch iudges, that therfore Rome may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioiſe which prouyded them? By the faith of a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I ſwere vnto the, that I count the Senatours worſe which ſent them: than the Iudges which we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thither. It is a great griefe to a noble &amp; ſtoute harte to demaunde iuſtyce of a man, which neither is true, nor yet obſerueth Iuſtice: but it is a greater grief to ſee a Iudge, that to many hath executed tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny, &amp; to many poore men hath done ſundry wronges, afterwardes not with the lyfe he leadeth, but with the authoritie he hath, preſumeth to correct diuers Iudges. He that hath the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyce to puniſh the vicious, ought him ſelfe to be voide of all vyces: otherwyſe, he that hath that office, by tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny executeth iuſtice, &amp; furthermore he is a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour to the common welth. It is vnpoſſible that any Iudge ſhoulde be good, vnleſſe he hath the aucthoritie of his office for acceſſary, and his pure lyfe for principall. The ende why a iudge is ſente in prouinces, is to defyne doubtfull cauſes, to refourme their maners, to fauour thoſe which can lytle, &amp; by vyole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to enforce thoſe whiche can do muche. And for the moſt parte there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welth ſo weake, but may well hang a thefe on the gallouſe, though there came no Iudge from Rome to geue ſentence. O how many iudges are there now a dayes in Rome, whiche haue cauſed dyuers to be hanged, regardynge nothyng but the firſt theefe: &amp; they remaine free, hauing robbed al the people. Which ought to thinke them ſelues aſſured, that though puniſhement be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, yet in the ende the fault ſhal not be pardoned. For the offences whych men in theire lyfe tyme doe diſſemble, the gods after theire death doe puniſhe. It is muche good for the common wealth, and no leſſe honour for the prince, which hath the charge thereof, that the Iudge be honeſt of parſon, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in iuſtice, and that in no vyce (for the which he puniſheth other) he be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noted or defamed himſelfe. For muche is the office of iuſtice peruerted, when one thiefe hangeth another on the galouſe.</p>

And for to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complyſhe the ſame, they ſent a verye aged manne (as by the heares of hys heade dyd well appeare) whoe was learned in the Hebrue greeke and lattine letters. For the <hi>Hebrues</hi> are verye apte to all ſciences, but in weapons greate towards. This Hebrue came to Rome, and ſpake to the Senate in this wiſe. O fathers conſcripte, O happy people, your good fortune and fatall deſtenies permittinge it, or to ſaye better, Wee forſakinge our God, <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> whyche of all the cities of <hi>Aſia</hi> was lady and mayſtres, and of all the Hebrues in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi> mother, wee ſee it nowe preſentlye ſeruaunt and trybutarye to Rome: wherof we Iewes ought not to maruaile, neyther ye Romaines to be proud.

And for aſmuche as in this caſe the Hebrues feele one, and ye Romaynes feele an other: neyther ye can cauſe mee to woorſhip manye gods and muche leſſe ſhoulde I bee ſufficient to drawe ye to the faithe of one onelye God. I referre all to God, the creatour of all thinges, by whoſe myght wee are created and gouerned.</p>
                     <p>Therefore touchinge the matter of my embaſſage, knowe ye nowe, that in all tymes paſte vntill this preſente, Rome hath hadde peace with <hi>Iudea</hi> and <hi>Iudea</hi> hath had frendſhip with Rome: ſo that wee did fauour ye in the warres and ye others preſerued vs in peace. In generallye nothinge is more deſyred then peace, and nothing more hated then warre. And further all this preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, we ſe it with our eyes, and alſo do reade of our predeceſſoures: that the worlde hath beene alwaies in contencion, and reſte hath alwaies bene bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. For in deede if we ſee manye ſighe for peace: we ſee manye moe employe them ſelues to warre. If ye other woulde baniſhe thoſe from you, whyche doe moue you to beare vs euyll will, and we others knewe thoſe whiche prouoke vs to rebell, neyther Rome ſhoulde bee ſo cruell to <hi>Iudea,</hi> nor yet <hi>Iudea</hi> ſhould ſo muche hate Rome. The greateſt token and ſigne of peace, is to dyſpatche out of the waye the diſtourbers thereof. For frendſhippe oftentymes is loſte, not ſo muche for the intereſt of the one or of the other, as for the vndiſcretenes of the mediatoures. When one common wealthe ſtryueth againſt another, it is vnpoſſible that theire controuerſies endure longe, if thoſe whiche come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene them (as indifferent mediatoures) be wyſe. But if ſuche one whych ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vppon him thoſe affaires, be more earneſtlye bent then the enemie wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with the other fyghteth: wee will ſaye, that hee more ſubtylye caſteth woode on the fyre, then he draweth water to quenche the heare.</p>
                     <p>All that whyche I ſaye (Romaynes) is becauſe that ſince the baniſhment of <hi>Archelaus</hi> from <hi>Iudea</hi> (ſonne of the greate kinge <hi>Herode</hi>) in his place ye ſent vs <hi>Pomponius, Mareus Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Valerius</hi> to bee oure Iudges: whoe haue bene foure plagues, the leaſte whereof ſuffyſeth to poyſon all Rome.</p>
                     <p>What greater calamitye coulde happen to oure poore realme of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> then Iudges to bee ſente from Rome to take euyll cuſtomes from the euyll: and they them ſelues to bee inuentoures of newe vyces? What greater inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience can chaunce to iuſtyce, then when the Iudges whiche oughte to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe the lyghtnes of youthe, doe glorifie them ſelues to bee captaines of the lyghte in theire age? What greater infamye can be to Rome, then when thoſe whyche ought to bee iuſte in all iuſtice, and to geue example of all vertues: be euyll in all euylles, and inuentoures of all vyces? Wherein appeareth your ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care and muche tyrannye.</p>
                     <p>For all ſayde openlye in <hi>Aſia,</hi> that the theues of Rome doe hang the theues of Iewrye. What will ye I ſhall ſaye more (Romaynes) but that wee lyttle eſteame the theeues whiche keepe the wooddes, in compariſon of the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges whyche robbe vs in oure owne houſes.</p>

For that layde a parte whiche they ſaye, that layde a parte whiche they meane, and that layde aparte whiche they robbe, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atelye they write to the Senate to conſent vnto them, not of the good whyche they fynde in the auncientes: but of the lightnes whiche they ſee in the yonge. And as the Senatoures doe heare them here, and doe not ſee them there: ſo ye geeue more credite to one that hathe beene but three monethes in the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uince, then to thoſe whiche haue gouerned the common wealth .30. yeares.</p>

                     <p>Therefore in this aboue all ſhalbee ſeene if ye bee vertuous, in that you do not beleue all. For if thoſe bee manye and of dyuers nations whiche haue to doe with you: muche more dyuers and variable are theire intencions, and endes, for the whiche they entreate. I lye if youre Iudges haue not done ſo manye wronges in iuſtice, &amp; forſaken theire diſciplyne: that they haue taught the youth of <hi>Iudea</hi> inuencions of vyces, whiche neither hathe bene hearde of oure fathers, neyther reade in oure bookes, ne yet ſeene in oure tyme.

For to knowe, and to haue lytle ſeldome times goeth together.

O my frinde <hi>Antigonus,</hi> I let you to wete, that ſince Rome dyd kepe her renowme, and the common wealth was well gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the dylygence whiche the Iudges vſed towardes the Senate, to the ende theye mighte geeue them offices: the ſelfe ſame oughte the Senate to haue to ſeke vertuous men, to commit ſuche charge into theire handes. For the office of iuſtice oughte to be geuen, not to him whiche procurethe it, but to him that beſt deſerueth it. In the yeare of the foundacion of Rome .6. hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth 42. yeares, the Romaine people had manye warres throughout al the world.

                     <p>It was founde written in a booke, which was in the highe Capitoll, that the graundefather of kynge <hi>Boco</hi> was very ſage, and a ſpecial friende to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne people, and that once hee came to Rome and made dyuers Orations to the Senat, and amongſt other notable ſentences, there was found in that booke, that he had ſpoken theſe wordes. Woe be to the that realme where all are ſuch, that neither the good amongeſt the euill, nor the euill amongeſt the good are knowen.

In ſuch, and ſo vnfortunate a realme, where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſo wicked, let euery man beware he bee not inhabitaunt. For in ſhorte time, they ſhal ſe vpon him, eyther the yre of the gods, the fury of the men, the depopulation of the good, or the deſolation of the tyrauntes.

                        <hi>OCtauian Auguſtus,</hi> ſeconde Emperour of Rome, is commended of all, for that he was ſo good of his perſone, &amp; ſo welbeloued in al the Romayne Empire. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> ſaieth, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any man dyed in Rome in his time, they gaue greate thankes to the gods for that they toke theire life from them, before theire Prince knewe what deathe ment. And not conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted onely with this, but in their teſtaments they commaunded their heires, &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that yearely they ſhould offer great ſacrifices of their propre goodes in al the temples of Rome, to the end the goddes ſhoulde prolong the daies of theire prince. That time in deede myghte be called the golden age, and the bleſſed land, where the prince loued ſo well his ſubiectes, and the ſubiectes ſo muche obeyed their prince. For ſeldome times it happeneth, that one will bee content with the ſeruices of all: neyther that all wil be ſatiſfyed withe the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of one. The Romaines for none other cauſe wiſhed for that good prince (more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues) life but becauſe he kepte the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth in peace. The vertue of this prince deſerued muche praiſe, and the good will of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people merited no leſſe commendation: he for deſeruinge it to them, and theye for geuinge it to him. For to ſaye the truethe, there are fewe in nomber that ſo hartely loue others, that for their ſakes will hate them ſelues. There is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo humble, but in thinges of honour will be content to goe beefore, ſaue onelye in deathe, where hee can be content to come behinde.

It is good the prince doe ſcoure the realme of theeues, for there is nothynge more vniuſte, thenne that whyche the poore wythe toyle and laboure doe gette, ſhoulde wyth vacabondes in idleneſſe bee waſted. It is good the prince do weede the realme of blaſphemers, for it is an euidente token that thoſe whiche dare blaſpheme the kynge of heauen, will
<pb facs="tcp:21411:205"/>
not let to ſpeake euill of the princes of the earthe. It is good the prynce dooe cleare the common wealthe of vacaboundes, and players: for playe is ſo euill a mote, that it eatethe the newe gowne, and conſumethe the drye woode. It is good that the prynce doe forbydde his ſubiectes of prodigall bankettes, and ſuperfluous apparell: for where men ſpende muche in thynges ſuperfluous, it chaunſeth afterwardes that they want of their neceſſaries. But I aſke nowe what auailethe it a prynce to baniſhe al vices from his common wealthe, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he keepeth it in warre? The end whye prynces are prynces, is to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the good, and to eſchewe the euill. What ſhall we ſaye therefore, ſins that in the time of warre, prynces cannot refourme vyces, nor correcte the vycy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. O yf Prynces and noble men knewe what domage theye doe to theire countreye, the daye that they take vppon them warre, I thinke and alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrme, that theye woulde not onelye not beginne it, nor yet anye pryuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone durſte ſcarſely remember it. And hee that dothe counſaile the prynce the contrarye, oughte by reaſon to be iudged to the common wealthe an ennemy. Thoſe whiche counſayle prynces to ſeke peace, to loue peace, to keepe peace, wythout doubte they haue wronge yf they be not hearde, yf they be not bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, and yf they be not credited. For the counſailer whyche for a lyghte oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſyon counſayleth hys prince to begynne warre, I ſay that vnto hym eyther color ſurmountethe, or els good conſcience wanteth. It chaunſethe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes that the prynce is vexed and troubled, beecauſe one certyfyethe hym that a prouynce is rebelled, or ſome other prince hathe inuaded his countrey and as the matter requirethe, the counſaile is aſſembled. There are ſome to raſhe counſailours, whyche immediatelye iudge peace to be broken as lyght<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, as others doe deſire that warres ſhoulde not begynne. Whan a prynce in ſuche a caſe aſketh counſayle, they oughte forthewithe not to aunſwere hym ſodaynely: for thinges touchinge the warres, oughte withe greate wyſedome firſte to be conſidered, and then withe as muche aduiſement to be determined. Kynge Dauid neuer toke warre in hande, thoughe he weare verye wyſe, but fyrſte he counſayled withe Godde. The good Iudas Machabee neuer e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred into battaile, but firſte he made his prayer vnto almightye godde. The Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes and Romaynes durſte neuer make warre againſte theire enemies, but firſt they would do ſacrifice to the goddes, and conſulte alſo withe their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. The matters of iuſtice, the recreacions of hys perſone, the reward of the good, the puniſhment of the euill, and the deuydynge of rewardes, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce maye communicate wythe anye pryuate man: but all matters of warre, he oughte fyrſte to counſayle withe God. For the prynce ſhall neuer haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte vyctorye ouer his enemies, vnleſſe he firſte committe the quarell thereof vnto Godde. Thoſe whiche counſaile princes (whyther it bee in matters of warre, or in the affaires of peace) oughte allwayes to remember thys ſentence: that theye geeue hym ſuche counſayles allwayes when hee ys whole in hys chamber, as theye woulde if theye ſawe hym at the poynte of deathe verye ſycke. For at that inſtaunte, noe manne dare ſpeake with flatterye, nor burden hys conſcience thoroughe bryberye.</p>
                     <p>Whenne theye entreate of warre, theye whyche moue it oughte to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, that if it came not well to paſſe, all the blame ſhall bee imputed to theyre cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile. And if that his ſubſtaunce be not preſently able to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence the loſſe,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21411:205"/>
let him aſſure him ſelfe, that hereafter hys ſoule ſhall ſuffer the payne. Men oughte ſo muche to loue peace, and ſo muche to abhorre warre, that I beeleue that the ſame preparacion a prieſte hath in his conſcience with God before he preſume to receyue the holye communion, the ſame oughte a counſayloure ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, before to his Prynce he geeueth counſayle in warre. Synce Princes are men, it is no merueile thoughe they fele iniuries as men, and that theye deſire to reuenge as men. Therefore, for this cauſe they oughte to haue wiſe men of their counſaile, whereby they ſhoulde mittigate and aſſwage their griefes and troubles. For the counſaylours of prynces, oughte neuer to counſaile thynges they being angry, wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after they may iuſtly be diſpleaſed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Folowing our matter, in counting the goodes which are loſt in loaſyng peace, and the euilles which encreaſe in winning warres, I ſay that amongſt other thinges the greateſt euil is, that in time of warre they locke vp cloſely al vertues, and ſet at lyberty all vyces. During the time that Princes and great Lordes maintaine warre, thoughe they be lordes of theire realmes and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions by right, yet for a truethe theye are not ſo in deede. For at that time the lordes deſire more to content their ſouldiours, and ſubiectes: then the ſouldy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſubiectes ſeke to content the lordes. And this they doe, becauſe theye thoroughe power myght vanquiſhe their enemies, and further thorough the loue of their money, relieue their neceſſities. Eyther princes are gouerned bye that whereunto by ſenſualitie they are moued, or els by that wherewith reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is contented. If they wil follow reaſon, they haue to much of that they poſſeſſe: but if they deſire to followe the ſenſuall appetite, there is nothing that wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them. For as it is vnpoſſible to dry vp all the water in the ſea: ſo it is hard to ſatiſfye the harte of man that is couetouſe. If prynces, take vppon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, ſaying that their ground is taken from them, and that thereof theye haue a conſcience: let them beware that ſuche conſcience be not corrupted. Form the worlde there is no warre iuſtified, but for the beginninge thereof, the princes at one time or an other, haue their conſcience burdened. If princes take vpon them warre for no other cauſe, but to augment their ſtate and dygnytye, I ſaye that this is a vaine hope: for theye conſume and loſe (for the moſt parte) more in one or twoe yeares warres, then euer theye gette agayne durynge theire life. If princes take vppon them warre, to reuenge an iniurye: as wel for thys allſo it is a thinge ſuperfluous. For manye goe to the warres beyng wronged onelye with one thinge, and afterwardes they returne iniuried with manye. If princes take vppon them warre for none other cauſe but to wynne honour, me thynkethe alſo that that is an vnprofitable conqueſte. For me thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth that fortune is not a perſon ſo famous, that into her handes a man maye commytte hys honoure, hys goodes, and lyfe. If prynces take vppon them warre to leaue of them in the worlde to come ſome memorye, thys no leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other ſemethe to me vaine. For withoute doubte, if we examine the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that be paſte, we ſhall finde thoſe to be more in nomber, whiche for begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge of warres haue bene defamed: then thoſe whiche for vanquiſhynge of theire enemies haue ben renowmed. If prynces take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> warre, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng that there are in an other countreye more pleaſures, and delightes, then in their owne: I ſaye, that to thinke this, procedethe of lytle experyence, and of leſſe conſcience. For to a prynce there can bee noe greater ſhame, nor conſcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:206"/>
then to beginne warres in ſtraunge realmes, to maineteyne his owne pleaſure and vyces at home. Let noe princes deceiue them ſelues, in thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge that there are in ſtraunge countreyes more thinges, thenne in theire owne. For in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende, there is noe lande nor nation in the world, where there is not winter and ſommer, nighte and daye, ſickeneſſe and healthe, riches and pouertye, myrthe and ſadneſſe, friendes and enemies, vitious and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, aliue and deade. Fynallye I ſaye, that in all partes all thinges agree in one, ſaue onely the diſpoſicions of menne, whiche are dyuers. I woulde aſke prynces and great lordes, the whiche doe and will liue at theyre pleaſures, what theye wante in theire realmes, yea thoughe theye bee litle? If theye will hunt, they haue mountaines and parkes: if theye will fiſhe, theye haue pondes: if theye will walke, theye haue riuers: if theye will refreſhe them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, theye haue baynes: if theye will bee merye, theye haue muſitians: if theye delighte in apparaylinge them ſelues, theye haue cythe clothes: if theye will geeue, theye haue moneye: if theye deſire weomen, theye haue wiues if they will take theire reſte, theye haue theire gardeines: if winter annoye them, theye haue whote countreis: and if theye will eate, theye wante no meates. Hee that wythe peace hathe all theſe thynges in hys owne dominion, whye thenne withe warre dothe hee ſeeke them in a ſtraunge countreye? Menne oftentymes flye from one countreye to another, not to bee more deuoute, nor more vertuous: butte to haue greater libertie and opportunitie to haunte vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And afterwardes whenne theye ſee the endes of theire deedes, theye cannot refraine theire hartes from ſighes, ſince theye mighte haue enioyed that at home withe peace, whyche in ſtraunge countreyes they ſoughte with trouble. There are ſo fewe thynges wherewythe wee are contented in the worlde, that if perchaunce a manne fynde in anye one place, anye one thing wherewithe to contente him, let him beeware that the deuill doe not deceyue him, ſayinge: that in ſuche another place hee maye recreate himſelfe better For whyther ſo euer we goe, wee ſhall finde ſuche penurye, and wante of true pleaſures, and comfortes, and ſuche coppie and abundaunce of troubles and tormentes that for to comforte vs in a hundrethe yeares wee ſcarcelye finde one, and to tormente vs, we finde at euerye foote a thouſande.</p>

                        <hi>DImo,</hi> an auncyente kynge of <hi>Ponto,</hi> ſayde vnto a phyloſopher why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was wythe hym: Tell mee phyloſopher, I haue helthe, I haue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure, and I haue ryches, is there anye thinge more to bee deſyred amongeſt menne, or to bee geeuen of the Goddes in thys lyfe? The phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher aunſwered hym. I ſee that I neuer ſawe, and I heare that I neuer hearde, For healthe, ryches, and honoure, the goddes ſeldome tymes doe truſte in one perſonne, hys tyme is ſo ſhorte that poſſeſſe them, that theye
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21411:206"/>
haue more reaſon to praye that theye myghte bee quyted of them, thenne for to bee proude for that theye poſſeſſe them. And I tell thee further kynge <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> it lytle profytethe that the goddes haue geeuen thee all theſe thynges, if thou doeſt not contente thye ſelfe therewythe, the whyche I think theye haue not geeuen thee, nor neuer will geeue thee. For the goddes are ſo iuſte in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uydynge theire giftes, that to them to whom theye geue contentacion, theye take from them ryches: and to thoſe whom theye geeue riches, they take their contentacion. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the fyrſte of hys pollytike puttethe this example, and he declareth not the name of thys phyloſopher.</p>
                     <p>O howe greate a benefyte is that, whiche the goddes geeue to prynces and greate lordes, in geeuinge them theire healthe, in geeuynge them ryches, and in geuinge them honour, but if beſides thoſe hee geueth them not contentaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I ſaye that in geeuynge them the goodes, hee geuethe them trauaile and daunger. For if the trauaile of the poore bee greater thenne the trauayle of the riche: wytheoute compariſon the diſcontentacion of the ryche, is greater then the diſcontentacion of the poore. Menne lytle regardynge theire healthe beecome ſicke, lytle eſteeminge theire riches beecome poore, and beecauſe theye knowe not what honoure is, theye become diſhonoured? I meane, that the raſhe prynces, vntill ſuche time as theye haue benne well beaten in the warres, will alwayes lytle regarde peace. The daye that yowe prynces pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme warres agaynſte youre enemies, you ſet at lybertye all vyces to your ſubiectes: Yet yowe ſaye youre meanynge is not theye ſhoulde bee euyll. I ſaye it is true. Yet all thys ioyned togethers, ye geeue them occaſion that theye bee not good. Let vs knowe what thynge warre is, and then we ſhall ſee, whyther it bee good or euill to followe it. In warres theye doe noughte els but kyll menne, robbe the temples, ſpoyle the people, deſtroye the innocen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes, geeue lybertie to theeues, ſeperate friendes, and rayſe ſtryfe: all the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thynges cannot bee done wytheoute greate hurte of iuſtyce, and ſcrupulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſytie of conſcyence. The ſedycious manne hym ſelfe canne not denaye vs, that if twoe Prynces take vppon them warres beetweene them, and that bothe of them ſeeme to haue ryghte, yet the one of them onelye hathe reaſon. So that the prynce whyche ſhall fyghte agaynſte iuſtice, or defende the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſte cauſe, ſhall not eſcape oute of that warre iuſtifyed: Not iſſuynge oute iuſtifyed, hee ſhall remayne condempned: and the condemnation ſhall be, that all the loſſes, murders, burnynges, hangynges, and robberies whiche were done in the one or other common wealthe, ſhall remayne vppon the account of hym, whyche tooke vppon hym the vniuſte warre. Allthoughe hee dothe not fynde an other prynce, that will demaunde an accoumpte of hym heare in thys lyfe yet hee ſhall haue a iuſte iudge that will in another place laye it to hys charge. The prince whiche is vertuous, and preſumethe to be a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, beefore hee beeginne the warre, oughte to conſidre what loſſe or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyte will enſue thereof. Wherein if the ende bee not proſperous, hee loſeth his goodes and honoure: and if hee perchaunce attaine to that he deſyred, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture his deſire was to the domage of the common wealthe, and then hee oughte not to deſire it. For the deſire of one, ſhould not hurte the profite of all. When GOD oure lorde dyd create prynces for prynces, and people accepted
<pb facs="tcp:21411:207"/>
them for their lordes, it is to beleue that the goddes neuer commaunded ſuche things, nor the men would euer haue excepted ſuch, if they had thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would not haue done that they were bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but rather that whereunto they were enclined. For if men follow that whereunto theire ſenſualitie enclinethe them, they do alwaies erre. Therefore if they ſuffer them ſelues to bee gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by reaſon, they are always ſure. And beſides that, princes ſhould not take vppon them warres, for the burdening of theire conſcience, the miſpendinge of their goodes, and the loſſe of their honour: they ought alſo to remember the dutie that they owe to the common wealth the which they are bounde to kepe in peace and iuſtice. For we others nede not gouernours to ſearch vs enemies but princes which may defend vs from the wicked. The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his .4 booke <hi>de legibus</hi> ſayeth, that one demaunded him why he did exalt the <hi>Lidians</hi> ſo much, and ſo muche diſpraiſe the <hi>Lacedemonians? Plato</hi> aunſwered: If I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the <hi>Lidians,</hi> it is for that they neuer were occupied but in tilling the field: and if I do reproue here the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> it is becauſe theye neuer knewe nothinge els but to conquere realmes. And therefore I ſaye, that more happie is that realme, where men haue their handes with labouring full of blyſters: then where theire armes in fightinge, are wounded withe ſweordes. Theſe wordes whiche <hi>Plato</hi> ſpake are verye true, and woulde to god that in the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and hartes of princes they were written. <hi>Plinius</hi> in an epiſtle ſayethe, that it was a prouerbe muche vſed amongeſt the Grekes, that he was kyng whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che neuer ſawe kynge. The lyke maye we ſaye, that he onelye maye enioye peace, whiche neuer knewe what warre meant. For ſimple &amp; innocent though a man be, there is none but will iudge him more happye, whiche occupyeth his handekerchiefe to drye the ſweate of his browes: then he that breakethe it to wipe the bloude of his heade. The princes and greate lordes which are louers of warre, ought to conſider, that they do not onelye hurte in generall all men, but alſo ſpecially the good: and the reaſon is, that allthoughe they of their own willes do abſtaine from battaile, doe not ſpoile, do not rebell, nor ſleye: yet it is neceſſarie for them to endure the iniuries, and to ſuffer theire owne loſſe and damages. For none are meete for the warre, but thoſe whiche litle eſteeme theire life, and muche leſſe theire conſciences. If the warre weare onely with the euill againſte the euill, and to the hurte and hinderaunce of the euill litle ſhoulde theye fele whiche preſume to be good. But I am ſory the good are per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecuted, the good are robbed, and the good are ſlaine: For if it were otherwyſe (as I haue ſayde) the euill againſte the euill, we would take litle thought both for the vanquiſhinge of the one, and muche leſſe for the deſtruccion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other. I aſke nowe, what fame, what honoure, what glorye, what victorie, or what riches in that warre can be wonne, wherein ſo manye good vertuous, &amp; wyſe men are loſte? There is ſuche penurye of the good in the worlde, and ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of them in the common wealthe, that if it weare in oure power, wee wythe oure teares oughte to plucke them oute of theire graues and geeue them lyfe, and not to leade them into the warres, as to a ſhambles to be put toe deathe. <hi>Plinie</hi> in one epiſtle, and <hi>Seneca</hi> in an other ſaye: that when theye deſyred a Romayne captain that with his army he ſhould enter into a greate daunger, whereof greate honoure ſhoulde enſue vnto hym, and lytle profyte to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthe: He aunſwered. For nothynge woulde I enter into that daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21411:207"/>
if it were not to geue life to a romayn citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For I deſire rather to go en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uironed with the good in Rome, then to go loden with treaſures into my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treye. Comparinge prince to prince, and lawe to lawe, and the chriſtian wyth the pagan: without compariſon the ſoule of a chriſtian oughte more to be eſte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>med, then the lyfe of a Romayne. For the good Romaine obſeruethe it as a lawe to dye in the warre: but the good chriſtian hathe this precepte, to lyue in peace. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> in the ſeconde booke of Ceſars ſayethe. That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge all the Romayne prynces there was noe prynce ſo wellbeloued, nor yet in the warres ſo fortunate as <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was. And the reaſon hereof is, beecauſe that prynce neuer beganne anye warre, vnleſſe by greate occaſyon he was thereunto prouoked. O of how many prynces (not ethnicks, but chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians) we haue hearde and reade all contrarye to thys, whyche is: that were of ſuche large conſcience, that theye neuer tooke vppon them anye warre that was iuſte. to whom I ſweare and promyſe, that ſince the warre which they in thys worlde beeganne, was vniuſte: the puniſhemente whiche in an other theye ſhall haue is moſte righteous. <hi>Xerxes</hi> kynge of the <hi>Perſes</hi> beynge one dayeat dynner, one broughte vnto hym verye faire and ſauourye fygges of the prouince of Athens: the whyche beeinge ſette at the table, he ſweare by the immortal goddes, and by the bones of his predeceſſours, that he would neuer eate fygges of hys countreye but of Athens, whych were the beſte of all Greece. And that whyche by woorde of mouthe kynge <hi>Xerxes</hi> ſweare, by valiaunt dedes withe force and ſhielde he accompliſhed, and wente foorthwith to conquere <hi>Gretia,</hi> for noe other cauſe, but for to ſyll him ſelfe wythe the ſyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of that countreye, ſo that he beganne that warre not onelye as a lyghte prynce: but alſo as a vicious man. <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> ſayethe that when the Frenche men did caſt of the wine of Italy, immediately they put them ſelues in armes and went to conquere the countreye, witheout hauinge anye other occaſion to make warre againſte them: So that the Frenchemen for the lycorouſnes of the pleaſaunt wynes, loſte the deare bloude of theire owne hartes. Kyng <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> dreamed one nighte that he ſawe kinge <hi>Methridates</hi> withe a fyeth in hys hande, who lyke a mower dyd cut all Italy. And there fell ſuche feare to kynge <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that he determined to kyll kynge <hi>Methridates:</hi> ſo that this wicked prince for credytinge a lighte dreame, ſet all the worlde in an vprore.</p>
                     <p>The Lumberdes beeinge in <hi>Pannonia,</hi> herde ſaye that there was in Italy ſweete fruites, ſauowry fleſhe, odoriferous wynes, faire women, good fiſh, litle colde, and temperate heate: the whyche newes moued them not onelye to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them, but alſo theye toke weapons to goe conquere Italye: So that the Lombardes came not into Italye to reuenge them of theire enemies, but to bee there more vicious and riotous. The Romaynes and the Carthagiens were friendes of longe time, but after they knew there was in Spaine great mynes of golde and of ſiluer, immediatelye aroſe betweene them exceadynge cruell warres, ſo that thoſe twoe puiſſaunt realmes, for to take eche from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their goods, deſtroyed their own proper dominions. The authors of the aboue ſaid, were <hi>Plutarchus, Paulus Diaconus, Beroſus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus Liuius.</hi> O ſecret iudgements of god which ſuffreth ſuch thyngs. O mercyful goodnes of thee my Lord, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ꝑmitteth ſuch things, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dreame of on price in his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:208"/>
another for to robbe the treaſures of <hi>Spayne,</hi> another to fly the colde of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry,</hi> another to drinke the wines of <hi>Italy,</hi> another to eat figges of <hi>Grece,</hi> ſhoulde put al the countrey to fire &amp; bloud. Let not my pen be cruel againſt al princes which haue vniuſt warres. For as <hi>Traianus</hi> ſaid. Iuſt warre is more worthe then fayned peace. I commend, approue, and exalt princes whiche are carefull &amp; ſtout, to kepe and defende that which their predeceſſours lefte them. For ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mit that for diſpoſſeſſing them, hereof cometh all the breache with other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Loke how much his enemy offendeth his conſcience for taking it: ſo much offendeth he his common wealth for not defending it. The wordes whiche the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſpake in the firſt booke of his laws, dyd ſatiſfye me greatly, which were theſe. It is not mete we ſhould be to extreme in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending thoſe which haue peace: nor let vs be to vehement in reprouing thoſe whiche haue warre. For it may be now, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if one haue warre, it is to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end to attaine peace. And for the contrary, if one haue peace, it ſhalbe to the ende to make warre. In deede <hi>Plato</hi> ſayde verye true. For it is more worthe to deſire ſhorte warre, for longe peace: then ſhort peace for longe warre. The philoſopher <hi>Chilo</hi> being demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whereby a good or euil gouernour might be knowen, he au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered. There is nothing wherby a good and euill man maye be better knowen, then in that for the which they ſtriue. For the tyranous Prince offrethe him ſelfe to dye to take from an other: but the vertuous prince trauaileth to defend his own. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the redemer of this worlde, departed from this worlde, he ſayde not I geue ye my warre, or leaue ye my warre: but I leaue ye my peace, and geeue you mye peace. Thereof enſuethe that the good chriſtian is bounde to keepe the peace, which Chriſt ſo muche commaunded: then to inuent warre to reuenge his pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per iniurye, which god ſo much hated. If princes dyd that they oughte to doe, and in this caſe woulde beleue me: for no temporall thing they ſhoulde condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to ſhed mans bloud, if nothinge els, yet at the leaſte the loue of hym whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che on the croſſe ſhed hys precious bloude for vs, ſhoulde from that cleane diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs. For the good Chriſtians are commaunded to bewaile theire owne ſinnes: but they haue no licence to ſhed the bloude of their enemies. Fynally I deſire, exhorte, and further admoniſhe al princes, and great lordes, that for his ſake that is prince of peace, they loue peace, procure peace, kepe peace, and liue in peace. For in peace they ſhalbe rich, &amp; their people happye.</p>

                        </gap>t hath ben a froſt. By this parable I meane, that one of the miſeries of this worlde is, that we ſhall ſe fewe in this worlde, which nowe bee proſperous: but beefore haue had fortune, in ſome caſes, very malitious. For we ſee by experience, ſome come to be very poore, and other chaunce to atteine to greate riches: ſo that thoroughe the impoueriſhing of thoſe, the other become riche, and proſperous. The we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the one, cauſeth the other to laugh: ſo that if the bucket that is emptye aboue, doth not go downe: the other whiche is full beneathe can not come vp. Speaking therefore according to ſenſuallyty, thou wouldeſt haue bene glad y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> day to haue ſene our triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phe, with the abundance of riches, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great nomber of captiues, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dyuerſitie of beaſts, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> valiantnes of the captaines, the ſharpnes of wittes which we brought from <hi>Aſia,</hi> &amp; e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred into Rome, wherby thou migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſt wel know the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we eſcaped in that warre. Wherefore ſpeakynge the truth, the matter betwene vs &amp; our enemies was ſo debated, that thoſe of vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eſcaped beſt, had their bodies ſore wounded, &amp; their vaines alſo almoſt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> out bloud. I let thee wete, my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Parthes</hi> are warlike men, &amp; in daungerous enterpriſes verye hardy &amp; bolde. And when theye are at home in their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey euery one w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ſtout hart defendeth his houſe, &amp; ſurely they do yt like good men, &amp; valiaunt captaines. For if we other romaines, without reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; through ambition, do go to take another mans: it is mete &amp; iuſte, that theye by force do defend their own. Let no man through the abundaunce of malice, or want of wiſedome enuy the Romaine Captaine, for any triumphe that is geuen him by his mother Rome for ſurely to get this only one daies honor, he adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tureth his life a M. times in the fielde. I wil not ſpeak al that I myght ſay of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we lede forth to the warres, nor of them which we leaue here at home in Rome, which be al cruell iudges of our fame: for theire iudgement is not vpright accordinge to equitye, but rather procedethe of malice, and enuye. Though they take me for a pacient man, &amp; not farre out of order, yet I let thee know my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no pacience can ſuffer, nor hart diſſemble, to ſee many romains to haue ſuch great enuy, which (thorough their malicious ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues) paſſe not to backebite other mens triumphes. For it is a olde diſeaſe of euil men, through malice to backebite that with their tong which through their cowardnes, they neuer durſt enterpriſe with their hands. Notwithſtanding al this ye muſt know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the warre you muſt firſt ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hazard your life, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to the diſcrecion of ſuche tonges commit your honour.

And therefore willinglye wee offer oure liues nowe to great trauaile, and payne onelye that amonge vaine men hereafter we maye haue a name.

For aſmuche as the one ſaythe it is iuſt, and the prince that taketh it vppon hym is iuſt. Others ſaye that it is vniuſt, and that the prince which beganne it, is a tyraunt. The poore and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious perſons do allowe it, to the ende they might goe, and take other mens goods by force. The riche and pacient do condemne it, becauſe thei would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye theire owne in quiet. So that they doe not iuſtifye or condempne warre, accordyng to the zeale of iuſtice: but accordinge to the little or muche profite, that ſhall folowe them of that enterpryſe. I commaunde whiche am a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne Emperour, warre to be proclaimed, becauſe a city or prouince hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, and that accordinge to theire cuſtome they doe obſerue the ceremonies of Rome. Firſt you muſt vnderſtand, the prieſtes muſt be called to goe im<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mediately to praye to the immortall gods: for the romaine people neuer went to ſhedde the bloude of theire enemies in the warres, but firſt the priſtes dyd ſhed the teares of theire eyes in the Temples.</p>
                     <p>Secondly al the ſacred Senate doth goe to the temple of the God <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and there they ſweare all with a ſolemne othe, that if the enemies (agaynſt whome they goe) doe require a newe confederacion with Rome, or demaund pardon of their faultes committed: that (all reuengement layde on ſyde) they ſhall not denye them mercye.</p>
                     <p>Thyrdlye the conſull whiche is appointed for captaine of the warre, went to the hygh capitoll, and there he maketh a ſolemne vowe to one of the gods, whiche lyketh hym beſt, that hee will offer hym a certaine Iewell, if hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne victorious of the ſame warre: and though the iewell whiche he dooth promiſe be of greate value, yet all the people are bound to paye it.</p>
                     <p>The .4. is, that they ſet vp in the temple of <hi>Mars</hi> the enſigne of the Egle, whiche is the auncient romaine enſigne, and that is, that all the Romaynes take it for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement, that no ſpectacle nor feaſt bee celebrated in Rome, durynge the tyme that theire brethren bee in the warres.</p>
                     <p>The .5. a Pretor mounteth vp to the toppe of the gate of <hi>Salaria,</hi> and theire hee bloweth the trumpet to muſter menne of warre, and they bring forth the ſtanders and enſignes to deuyde them amonge the Captaines.</p>
                     <p>How fearfull a thyng is it to ſee, that ſo ſoone as the Captayne is enuyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wyth thenſigne, ſo ſoone hath he lycence to commit all euyls, and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes. So that he taketh it for a brauerye, to robbe the countreys whereby he paſſeth: and to deceyue thoſe wyth whome hee practyſeth. What lyberty cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes and gouernours of warre haue to doe euyll, and to bee euyll, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye manyfeſt in thoſe whome they leade in theire companye. For the ſonnes leaue theire fathers, the ſeruauntes theire lordes, the Schollers theire may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, the offycers theire offyces, the prieſtes theire Temples, the amarouſe theire loues, and this for none other cauſe, but that vnder the coloure of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of warre, their vyces ſhoulde not be puniſhed by iuſtyce. O my frende <hi>Cornelius,</hi> I know not how I ſhould begin to ſay that whiche I wil tel thee. Thou oughteſt to know, that after our men of warre are gone out of Rome they neyther feare the gods, neither honour the temples, they reuerence not the prieſtes, they haue no obedience to their fathers, nor ſhame to the people, dread of iuſtice, neither compaſſion of theire countrey, nor reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that they

are children of Rome: and yet very fewe of them thinke to end theire lyfe, but that all ſhame layde aſyde, they loue the condemned ydlenes, and hate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſte trauaile. Therefore harke, I will tell thee more, and though it ſeemeth much that I ſpeake, I enſure thee it is but lyttle in reſpecte of that they doe, for ſo muche as ſome robbe temples, others ſpread rumours, theſe breake the dores, and thoſe robbe the Gods. Somtymes they take the free, ſomtymes they loſe the bond. The nights they paſſe in playes, the daies in blaſphemies, to daye they fight lyke lyons, to morrowe they flye lyke cowardes. Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt the Captaines, and others flye to the enemies. Fynallye, for all good they are vnhable, and for all euyll they are meete. Therfore to tell the of theire filthynes, I am aſhamed to deſcribe them.</p>
                     <p>They leaue theyre owne wyues, and take the wyues of others, they dyſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the doughters of the good, and they begile the innocent Virgines, there is no neyghbour but they doe couet, neyther hoſteſſe but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they do force, they breake theire olde wedlocke, and yearely ſeeke a newe mariage: ſo that they doe all thinges what they liſt, and nothinge what they ought. Doeſt thou think preſently my frend <hi>Cornelius</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are few euils in Rome, ſith ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny euyl women do go to the warre? Here for their ſake, men offend the gods, they are traytours to theire countrey, they denye theire parentage, they doe come to extreme pouerty, they lyue in infamy, they robbe the goods or others, they waſte theire owne, they neuer haue quiet lyfe, neither remaineth anye trueth in theire mouthes: fynallye for the loue of them, oftentymes warre ys moued agayne, and manye good menne loſe theire lyues. Let vs leaue the reaſons, and come to hyſtoryes.</p>
                     <p>Thou knoweſt right well, that the greateſt parte of <hi>Aſia</hi> was conquered and gouerned, more with the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Amazones,</hi> then with any barbarous people. That yong, noble, and valyaunt <hi>Porro,</hi> kinge of <hi>Iudea,</hi> for want of menne, and aboundans of women, was ouercome of the great <hi>Alexander. Hanniball</hi> the terrible captaine of the <hi>Carthagiens</hi> was alwaies lorde of <hi>Italy,</hi> vntill hee dyd permitte women to goe to the warre. And when he fell in loue with a may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Capua,</hi> they ſawe him immediatlye tourne his ſhoulders to Rome. If <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Affricane</hi> had not ſkoured the Romayne armyes of lecherye, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible <hi>Numantia</hi> had neuer beene wonne. The Captayne <hi>Silla</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and the couragious <hi>Marius,</hi> in the warre of the <hi>Zimbtes,</hi> hadde ouer theire enemyes ſo manye victories, becauſe in theire campes they ſuffred no women. In the tyme of <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour, the <hi>Tharentines</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puans</hi> were verye mortall enemyes, in ſo muche as the one agayne the other pytched theyre campe, and by chaunce one daye in the campe of the <hi>Capuans,</hi> two Captaynes fell at varyaunce, becauſe they bothe loued one woman, and when the <hi>Tharentines</hi> perceyued theire diſſenſyon, immediatlye with theyre power gaue them the onſet.</p>
                     <p>Whereof it enſueth, that throughe the naughtyneſſe of one euyll woman, was loſt the lybertie of that goodlye citye. I hadde in this warre of <hi>Parthes</hi> 16. thouſande horſemen, and .24. thouſand footemen, and .35. thouſand women, and the diſorder in this caſe was ſo greate, that from the hoſte I ſent my wife <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> and the wyues of dyuers other Senatours home to theire houſes, that they ſhoulde kepe the olde and nouriſhe the yonge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:211"/>Our forefathers led women in the olde tyme to the warre, to dreſſe meate for the whole, and to cure the wounded: but nowe wee leade them to the ende cowardes ſhoulde haue occaſyon to be effeminate, and the valyaunt to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. And in the ende, theire enemies doe breake their heades: but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doe wound theire hartes. I will that thou knowe other thynges, my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and they are, that the <hi>Gawles,</hi> the <hi>Vulcanes,</hi> the <hi>Flaminii,</hi> the <hi>Regii,</hi> the whyche are prieſtes of the mother <hi>Sibilla,</hi> of the god <hi>Vulcane,</hi> of the god <hi>Mars,</hi> and of the god <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the feare of the gods ſet aſyde, leauynge theyre temples deſert, laying of theire honeſt garmentes, not remembringe theyre holye ceremonies, breakynge theire ſtreight vowes, an infinite nomber of them goe to the campe, where they loue more diſhoneſtlye then others: for it is a common thynge, that thoſe whyche once preſume to bee ſolytarye, and ſhamefaſte, after that they are once fleſhed: exceede all other in ſhame &amp; vyce.</p>
                     <p>It is a dyſhoneſt thinge, and alſo perillous to carye prieſtes to the warre: for theire offyce is to pacifye the gods wyth teares, and not to threaten men wyth weapons. If perchaunce Prynces woulde ſaye, it is good to carye prieſtes to the warre to offer ſacrifices to the gods: To thys I aunſwer, that the temples are buylt to praye, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyeldes for to fyght: ſo that in one place the gods woulde bee feared, and in an other honoured and ſacrifyced. In the yeare of the foundacion of Rome .315. the conſull <hi>Vietro</hi> paſſed into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and went agaynſt the <hi>Paleſtines,</hi> the whych there rebelled againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaynes, and by the waye he paſſed by the temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> in the yle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> and as there hee made a prayer vnto the god <hi>Apollo</hi> verye longe, to the ende hee woulde reuele vnto hym whether hee ſhoulde returne victorious from <hi>Aſia</hi> or not. The oracle aunſwered. O conſull <hi>Vietro</hi> yf thou wilt retourne victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious from thy enemies, reſtore our prieſtes whiche thou takeſt from oure temples. For wee other goddes will not: that the man whome wee chooſe for oure deuyne ſeruyce, ye others ſhoulde leade to the vyces of the worlde. If it bee true (as it is true in deede) that the god <hi>Apollo</hi> ſayde vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull <hi>Vietro,</hi> mee thinketh it is no iuſte thynge to co condeſcende that prieſtes ſhoulde goe to looſe them ſelues in the warre.</p>
                     <p>For as thou knoweſt my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> wythout doubte greater is the offence that they committe in goynge to vndooe them ſelues, then is the ſeruyce whyche they doe to princes beynge deſyrous to fyght.</p>
                     <p>Let vs haue the priſtes in the Temples to praye, and let vs ſee howe the captaynes are wont to gouerne them ſelues, and in this caſe thou ſhalt fynde that the daye that the Senate doe appointe a Senatour for captayne, they proue hym if hee can playe at the weapons in the Theater.</p>
                     <p>The Conſull leadeth hym to the hygh capitoll wyth hym, the Egle is han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at hys breſt, they caſt the purple vppon hys ſhoulders, they giue him mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the common treaſour, immediatlye hee groweth into ſuche pryde, that forgettinge the pouertie paſt whyche hee ſuffered in hys countrey, hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth one daye to make hym emperour of Rome. It is a common thynge, that when fortune exalteth menne of lowe eſtate, to hygh degree, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume muche, and knowe lyttle, and muche leſſe what they are woorthe. So that if theire feeble force were coequall to their high mynde, one alone ſhould ſuffiſe to ouer come their enemies, and alſo to winne many realmes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="27" facs="tcp:21411:211"/>The Captaines haue taken a cuſtome nowe in Rome, and they tell mee that it is an inuention of <hi>Mauritane,</hi> that is, that they teaſe theire beardes, they curle theire heares, they clippe theire woordes, they chaunge their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, they accompanye wyth murderers, they goe the moſte part armed, they goe verye faſte to ſeeme fierce, and to conclude they lyttle eſteeme to bee beloued, and take it great glorye to bee feared.</p>
                     <p>And to thentent thou ſhouldeſt knowe, my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> howe muche they woulde bee feared, I will recyte thee an hiſtorye whyche is, that I ſtandyng one daye in <hi>Penthapolyn,</hi> a captayne of myne, I hearinge him, and hee not ſeeing mee, for ſo muche as they woulde not let hym doe all that hee woulde haue done in the houſe, hee ſayde vnto an hoſtice of his.</p>
                     <p>Ye other villaynes dyd neuer knowe captaines of armies, therefore know it, if thou doeſt not knowe it mother, that the earthe doth neuer tremble, but when yt is threatned wyth a Romayne Captaine, and the gods doe neuer ſuffer the Sunne to ſhine, but where wee others are obeyed.</p>
                     <p>Sins thou haſt nowe harde that hee ſaide, heare alſo the valiauntnes that hee hath doone. Within ſhorte ſpace after, the captayne went vnto a battayle in <hi>Arabia,</hi> where hee was the firſte that fledde, and lefte the ſtanderd alone in the fielde, the whiche had almoſte made mee loſe the battaile. But I in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of his valyaunt deede, commaunded to cut of his great head. For in giuing the onſet vppon the enemies, the flyenge of one manne doth more hurte, then the fightinge of two thouſande doth profite. I haue often tymes heard the emperour <hi>Traian</hi> my lorde ſaye, that the menne whiche in peace ſeeme moſte fierce, in warres commonlye are moſte cowardes.</p>
                     <p>It chaunceth that dyuers thynges are compaſſed, for hauing onely a good eloquence, others for hauinge wytche crafte, others for being verye diligent, others for opening theire purſe, and truely this is the moſte and beſt meane that is occupied in Rome. But the affayres of warres do not conſiſte, in tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge many wordes before theyre friendes: but in fightinge manfullye in the fielde againſt their enemies. For in the ende, men moſt full of wordes, are for the moſte parte cowardes in dedes. What wilt thou I tell the more, my <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lius,</hi> of the iniuries which the captainez do in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cities wherby they paſſe, of the ſclaunders whiche they rayſe in the prouinces where they abyde? I let thee weete, that the little woorme doth not ſo muche harme that gnaweth the wood, the moth to the garmentes: the ſparke vnto the toae, the locuſt vnto the corne, neither the wyuell to the garners, as the captaines doe to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For they leaue no beaſt but they kyll, nor orchyarde but they robbe, nor wine but they drinke, nor doue houſe but they clime, nor temple but they ſpoile, nor chaſe but they hunt, no ſedicion but they rayſe, no villany but that they committe. And they do more then they ought to do, for they eat w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out meaninge to paye, and they will not ſerue vnleſſe they be well payed: and the woorſt of all is, that if they haue theire paye, immediatly they change or plaie it. If they bee not paied, they robbe and mutine forthwith: ſo that with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie they are not content, and with ryches they waxe vicious and inſolent. The matter is nowe come to ſuch corrupcion, and there is at this daye men of warre in Rome ſo careleſſe, that here no captaine ſeemeth but an example
<pb facs="tcp:21411:212"/>
of murderers, a ſturrer vp of ſedicious perſons, an enuyer of the good, a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker wyth all euyll, a theef of theeues, a pirate of rouers, and fynally I doe not ſay that they ſeeme to bee: but I doe affirme that they are the ſcourge of your vertuous, and refuge of the vicious. I woulde not ſay this, but yet not withſtandyng I ought to ſaye it, becauſe it is a thing ſo farre out of order, and ſo much to bee laughed at: that theſe wicked menne though they are our familiar enemies, there is no prince that ruleth them, nor Iuſtice that correcteth them, nor feare that doth oppeſſe them, nor law that ſubdueth them, nor ſhame that refraineth them, nor parents that correct them, nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhement that doth abaſe them, nor yet death that doth end them: but now as menne which are without remedy, wee let them eat of all.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>O</hi> Vnfortunat Rome, who was not wont to haue ſuch euill lucke, but the older thou art, the more vnlucky I ſee thee. For by writings wee read, and alſo with our eyes wee ſee, that the more fortunat a citye or perſonne hath been in the beginning, the more froward fortune is vnto him in the endyng. Truely in thoſe auncient tymes, and in thoſe glorious worlds, I ſay when they were peopled wyth true Romaynes, and not as now (they which haue no children but baſtardes) the armies were ſo well taught that came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, as the philoſophers which were in the ſchooles of Greece. If the greeke writinges do not lye vnto mee, <hi>Phillip</hi> the greate king of <hi>Macedony,</hi> for this is ſo renowmed in hiſtories, and his ſonne the great <hi>Alexander</hi> for this was ſo fortunate in the warres, that they had their armies ſo well correct: that it rather ſeemed a Senate which gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then a camp which fought. In that wee can gather out of <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> and other wryters, from the tyme of <hi>Quintus Cincinnatus</hi> dictator, vntill the noble <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> were the moſt proſperous tymes of the Romayne empire. For before kings dyd trauail, and afterwards it was perſecuted with tyraunts. In theſe ſo happy tymes, one of the greateſt felicities that Rome had, was to haue the warrelyke diſcipline well corrected. And then Rome began to fall, when our armyes began to doe dommage. For if thoſe of the warre haue, truce with vyces, the others of the common wealth can not haue peace with vertues. O curſed bee thou <hi>Aſia,</hi> and curſed bee the day that with thee wee had conqueſt. For wee haue not ſeene the good that haue folowed vs of thy conqueſt, vntill this preſent, and the loſſe and dommage which from thee came vnto vs, ſhalbee lamented in Rome foreuer. O cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Aſia,</hi> wee ſpent our treaſures in thee, and thou haſt geeuen to vs thy vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In chaunge of our valyant menne, thou haſt ſent vs thy fine mineons, wee haue wonne thy cities, and thou tryumpheſt of our vertues. Wee batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thy fortes, and thou haſt deſtroyed our maners. Wee triumphe of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almes, and thou diddeſt cut the throtes of our friends. Wee made to thee cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell warre, and thou conquereſt from vs the good peace, With force thou were
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:21411:212"/>
ours, and with good will wee are yours. Wee are vniuſt lordes of thy riches, and iuſt tenauntes of thy vyces. Fynally thou <hi>Aſia</hi> art a wofull graue of Rome, and thou Rome art a fylthy ſinke of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Since our auncient fathers dyd content them ſelues with Rome alone, why ſhould not wee theire chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren content our ſelues with Rome and <hi>Italy?</hi> but that wee muſt goe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>Aſia,</hi> where wee aduentured our honor, and ſpent our treaſure? If thoſe auncient romaines, being as they were, ſo princely barons in lyfe, and ſo valyaunt in fyghting, and ſo hardy to commaund, dyd content them ſelues wyth this lyttle border: why ſhould not wee content our ſelues not being as they are, hauing a realme riche and vicious? I knowe not what fond toye tooke vs in the head, to goe conquer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and not to content our ſelues wyth Rome? <hi>Italy</hi> was not ſo poore of ryches, nor ſo deſtitute of cities, nor ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled of people, nor ſo ſolitary of beaſts, nor ſo vndecked with buyldin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor ſo barrayne of good fruites: but that of all theſe things wee had more, then our fathers wiſhed, and alſo more then wee theire children deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For mee I would ſay, that it is for want of iudgement or aboundaunce of pryde, for vs to ſeeke to exceede our forefathers in ſeignorie: when we are not coequall vnto them in vertue. I was contented with all thinges of my forefathers, ſaue onely that they were a lytle proud, and ſeditious, and herein wee theire children doe reſemble them well.</p>
                     <p>For as muche as wee are not onely proude and ſedicious, but alſo couetous and malycious. So that in vertuous things wee go backeward, and in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull woorkes wee goe forward. What is become of the great victories that our forefathers had in <hi>Aſia?</hi> What is become of the infinite treaſure they haue robbed in that countrey? what is become of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great nomber of captiues that they tooke in the warre? what is become of the ſtraunge beaſtes that they ſent into <hi>Italy.</hi> What is become of the ryches which euerie one brought home to his houſe? what is become of the valiaunt kinges which they tooke in that conqueſt? what is become of the feaſtes and triumphes, wherewyth they entred triumphing into Rome? What wilt thou I ſay more vnto thee in this caſe, (my <hi>Cornelius</hi>) but that all they which inuented the warre are dead, all thoſe which were in <hi>Aſia</hi> are dead, al thoſe which defended that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey are dead, all thoſe which entred triumphing into Rome are dead, and fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, all the riches and tryumphs whiche our fathers brought from <hi>Aſia,</hi> they and thoſe in ſhort ſpace had an end, except the vyces &amp; pleaſures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee ſee no end. O if the valyaunt princes knewe, what a thing it is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent warres in ſtraunge realmes, what trauayls they ſeeke for theire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, what cares in their hartes, what trouble to their ſubiects, what waſte to theire treaſors, what pouertie to their frends, what pleaſures to theire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, what deſtruccion of the good, what libertie of the euill, and what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion they geeue to ſtraungers to ſpeke, what vniuerſall euyll they ſow in their naturall countreys, and what euill poiſon they leaue to their heires: I ſwere by the faith of a good man, that if as I feele it, princes did feele it, and as I taſte it, princes did taſte it, &amp; alſo as I haue proued it, princes dyd proue it, I do not ſay that with effuſion of blood I woold take realmes by force: but alſo they offering them to mee with teares, I woold not take the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> willingly. For ſpeaking the truth, it is not the point of valyaunt princes for to ſuſtayne
<pb facs="tcp:21411:213"/>
an other mans, to put theire owne in ieoperdye. I aſke nowe, what profite toke Rome of the conqueſt of <hi>Aſia?</hi> I admitte that it durſt conquer it, that it was hardye in winning it, obſtinate in fightinge, and happy in takinge it: ſhoulde it therefore bee fortunate in maintaininge it? In this caſe I ſaye and affirme, and of that I ſaye I doe not repent mee: that it is poſſible to take <hi>Aſia,</hi> but it is but a folye to preſume to maintaine it.</p>
                     <p>Doeſt thou not thinke it a great folye to preſume to maintaine <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſynce there neuer commeth newes of a victorye, but that it is occaſion of an other battayle, and that to ſuſtaine warre, they robbe all <hi>Italy?</hi> In <hi>Aſia</hi> our money is ſpent, our children are periſhed: In <hi>Aſia</hi> dyed our fathers, for <hi>Aſia</hi> they make vs paye tributes: In <hi>Aſia</hi> the good horſes are conſumed: Into <hi>Aſia</hi> they cary all our corne: In <hi>Aſia</hi> all the theeues are nouriſhed: From <hi>Aſia</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Thoſe Princes not being har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, nor ſo bolde to ſuſtaine <hi>Aſia</hi> by lande, ſhoulde wee others preſume to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour it by ſea? They forſake it being neighbours, and will wee others main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it being ſtraungers? In my oppinion <hi>Aſia</hi> is a countrey, where all the valiaunt men haue employed theire valauntnes, where all the fooles haue proued theire folye, where al the proude haue ſhewed theire pryde, where all the princes entred in with myght, where all the tyrauntes haue employed theire lyfe: but in the ende, it neither profiteth the one to wyll it, nor to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to knowe it, and yet muche leſſe to vanquiſhe it.</p>
                     <p>I knowe not the man that loueth <hi>Aſia,</hi> that wylleth well to <hi>Aſia,</hi> that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth well of <hi>Aſia,</hi> or that fauoureth the thynges of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſince ſhee geueth vs occaſion to ſpeake daylye, to ſigh nightly, and to weepe hourely.</p>
                     <p>If men atteined to the ſecrete to knowe the fatall deſtenies, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which the goddes haue created <hi>Aſia,</hi> they woulde not ſtriue ſo much in the conqueſt thereof.

I aſke nowe what they were that inuented to dyne in common places, to ſuppe in ſecrete gardeines, to apparaile the women as menne in the theatre, to colour the fleſhe of prieſtes with yellow? to noynt the women as menne in the bathe, the Senatours goyng ſmellyng to the Senate, Prynces to bee apparanied with purple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the auncient decree? to eate twiſe in the daye as the Tyraunt <hi>Dennys</hi> did, to keepe harlottes and concubines as they of <hi>Tyre</hi> doe, to ſpeake blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myes agaynſt the goddes whyche were neuer heard of before in the empire? Theſe ſayde vyces of <hi>Aſia, Aſia</hi> hath preſently ſent to Rome.</p>
                     <p>At the ſame tyme when in thoſe partyes of the Oriente, the warre was kyndeled: tenne valyant capytaynes brought theſe vyces to Rome, whoſe names my penne ſhall pardone to tell, becauſe theire vyle offences ſhoulde not obſcure theire valyaunt deedes. Before that Rome conquered <hi>Aſia</hi> wee were ryche, wee were pacyent, wee were ſober, wee were wyſe, wee were honeſte, and aboue all wee lyued contented.</p>
                     <p>But ſynce that tyme wee haue geeuen our ſelues to forgeat the polycyes of Rome, and to learne the pleaſure of <hi>Aſia:</hi> ſo that nowe all vyces may be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Rome, as all ſciences maye bee hearde in <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the aboue rehearſed, all warlyke prynces maye ſee, what profyte they haue to conquer ſtraunge realmes. Let vs nowe leaue the vyces, whyche in the warres are recouered, and talke of money whyche the princes couet and loue. And in this I ſaye, that ther is no prince brought into ſo extreme pouertie, as hee whyche conquereth a ſtraunge countrey.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Cornelius,</hi> thou haſte not ſeene howe Prynces more of a wyl then of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie doe waſte theire treaſoures: howe they demaunde that of another mannes, and howe theire owne doth not ſuffyce them: they take thoſe of chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches, they ſeeke greate lones, they inuent great tributes, they demaund grete ſubſidies, they geeue ſtraungers occaſion to ſpeake, and make them ſelues hated of theire ſubiectes: fynallye they praye theire ſubiectes, and humble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to theire enemies. Synce I haue declared the dommages of warre, I wyll nowe declare what the originall of warre is.</p>
                     <p>For it is vnpoſſible that the phiſition applye vnto the ſicke agreable mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyne, if hee knowe not of what humour the ſickeneſſe doth proceede.</p>
                     <p>Prynces ſynce they came of menne, are noryſhed with menne, doe counſayle with men, and lyue with menne, and to conclude they are menne. Sometime through pryde whyche aboundeth in them: ſometyme through want of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle, they them ſelues imagine, and other flatterers telleth, that though they haue muche in reſpecte of other prynces, yet they can doe lytle. Alſo they ſaye vnto them, that yf theire ſubſtance bee great, their fame ought to be greater. Further they tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the good prince ought litle to eſteeme that hee hath inherited of his predeceſſors, in reſpect of the greate deale more hee ought to leaue to his ſucceſſors.

houre that one is choſen emperour of Rome, he maye boldly conquere all the whole earth. Theſe vayne reaſons being hearde of the princes, afterwardes as theire fortune is baſe, and theire myndes high, immediatly they defye their enemies, they open theire treaſures, they aſſemble great armies: and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of all, the goddes ſuffer, that they thinkinge to take an other mannes goods, they waſte and loſe theire owne. O princes, I knowe not whoe doth deceyue ye, that you whyche by peace maye bee riche, and by warre will bee poore?</p>
                     <p>O princes, I know not who doth deceiue you, that you whiche may be loued doe ſeke occaſions to bee hated. O princes, I knowe not who doth begyle ye, that ye whiche maye enioye a ſure lyfe, doe aduenture your ſelues to the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie of fortune. O princes, I knowe not who doth deceiue you, that you ſo little eſteeme and wey your owne haboundaunce, and ſo greatlye ſet by the want of others. O princes, I knowe not who doth deceiue you, that all haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g nede of you, you ſhoulde haue nede of others. I let thee to wete my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> thoughe a prince bee more quicke and carefull then all other his predeceſſors haue beene in Rome: yet it is vnpoſſible that all thinges touchynge warre, ſhoulde ſuccede vnto him proſperouſely. For in the greateſt neede of warre, either he wanteth money, or his ſubiectes doe not ſuccour him, or tyme is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarye vnto hym, or hee fyndeth perillous paſſages, he lacketh artillarye, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Captaines rebell, or els ſuccour commeth to his aduerſaries: ſo that hee ſeeth hym ſelfe ſo miſerable, that thoughtes doe more oppreſſe his harte, then the enemyes doe harme his lande. Though a prince had no warre, but for to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer menne of warre, yet hee ought to take vppon him no warre. I aſke thee my <hi>Cornelius,</hi> what trauaile ſo greate to his parſonne, or what greater dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to his realme can his enemies doe, then that whiche his owne men of warre doe? The enemyes, to doe the worſte they canne, will but robbe oure frontiers: but our menne of warre do robbe all the whole countrey. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes we dare and maye reſiſt, but to oures we cannot, nor dare not ſpeake. The enemies, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſt they can do, is once in a moneth to robbe &amp; runne theyr ways: but ours dayly do robbe, &amp; remayn ſtil. The enemyes feare their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies only, but ours do feare their enemies, &amp; haue no pitie on their frids. The enemies, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> further thei go on, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more thei diminiſh: but ours y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> further thei go, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more they encreaſe. I know no greater warre y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> princes can haue, then to haue men of warre in their realmes. For as experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth ſhew vs, before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods they are culpable, to princes importunate, &amp; to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people troubleſome: ſo that they lyue to the dommage of all, and to the profite of none. By the God Mars I ſweare vnto thee (my frende <hi>Cornelius</hi>) as hee maye directe my handes in the warre, that I haue mo complaintes in the Senate, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> theftes whyche my captaynes doe committe in <hi>Illiria,</hi> then of all the enemyes of the Romayne people. Bothe for that I ſaye, and for that I keepe ſecrete. I am more afrayde to create an enſygne of twoe hundred menne of warre, then to geue a cruell battaile to thirtye thouſande menne. For that battaile, fortune (good or euyll) forthwith diſpatcheth, but with theſe I can bee ſure no tyme of all my lyfe. Thou wilte ſaye vnto mee <hi>(Cornelius)</hi> that ſince I am Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Rome, I ſhoulde remedy this ſince I knowe it. For that prince which diſſembleth with the fault of another, by reaſon hee wyll condempne hym, as if it were his owne. To thys I aunſwere, that I am not myghtye ynough
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21411:214"/>
to remedy it, except by my remedye there ſhoulde ſpring a greater inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And ſince thou haſt not bene a Prince, thou couldeſt not fall into that I haue, nor yet vnderſtand that whych I ſaie. For princes by theire wiſedome knowe manye thinges, the whych to remedy they haue no power. So it hath beene, ſo it is, ſo it ſhalbe, ſo I founde it, ſo I keepe it, ſo wil I leaue it them, ſo I haue read it in bookes, ſo haue I ſeene it with my eyes, ſo I heard it of my predeceſſours, and finallye I ſaye, ſo our fathers haue inuented it, and ſo wyll wee theire children ſuſtaine it, and for this euyll, wee will leaue it to our heires. I wyll tell thee one thinge, and imagine that I erre not therein, whych is, conſideringe the great dommage, and lytle profyte, which the men of warre doe bringe to our common wealth: I thynk to doe it, and to ſuſtaine it, either it is the folly of menne, or a ſcourge geuen of the gods. For there can be nothinge more iuſt, then for the goddes to permit, that we feele that in our owne houſes: whiche we cauſe others in ſtraunge houſes to lament. All thoſe thinges I haue written vnto thee, not for that it ſkilleth greatly that thou knowe them: but that my harte is at eaſe to vtter them: For as <hi>Alcibiades</hi> ſaide, the cheſtes, and the hartes, ought alwaies to bee open to theire frendes. <hi>Panutius</hi> my ſecretary, goeth in my behalfe to viſite that land, and I gaue him this letter to geue the, with two horſes, wherewith I think thou wilt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, for they are gennettes.

                        <hi>AVlus Gelius</hi> in hys booke <hi>De noctibus Atticis</hi> ſayeth, that there was an auncient cuſtome amongeſt the romaynes, to honour and haue in great reuerence aged men. And this was ſo inuiolate a law amongeſt them, that there was none ſo noble of bloode and lynage, neyther ſo puiſſaunt in ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, neither ſo fortunate in battayles, that ſhould goe before the aged men, which were loden with whit heares: ſo that they honoured them as the gods, and reuerenced them as theire fathers. Amongeſt other the aged menne had theſe preheminences, that is to wete, that in feaſtes they ſate higheſt, in the triumphes they went before, in the temples they did ſitte downe, they ſpake to the Senate before all others, they had their garments ſurred, they might eat alone in ſecrat, and by theire onlye woorde they were credited as witneſſes: Fynally I ſaye, that in all thinges they ſerued them, and in nothinge they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed them. After the people of Rome began warre wyth <hi>Aſia,</hi> they forſooke all theire good Romayne cuſtomes immediatlye.</p>
                     <p>And the occaſyon hereof was, that ſince they had no menne to ſuſtaine the common wealth, by reaſon of the great multytude of people which dyed in the warre: they ordeyned that al the yong menne ſhould mary, the yong maides, the wydowes, the free, and the bonde, and that the honour whyche hadde
<pb facs="tcp:21411:215"/>
bene done vntyll that tyme vnto the olde menne, from henceforthe ſhoulde be done vnto the maried menne, though they were yong. So that the moſte ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in Rome was hee, not of moſte yeares, but he that had moſt children. This lawe was made a little before the firſte battaile of <hi>Catthage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the cuſtome that the maried menne were more honoured, then the old menne, endured vntill the tyme of the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> whiche was ſuch a frende of antiquyties, that hee renewed all the walles of Rome with newe ſtones, and renewed all the auncient cuſtomes of the common wealth. <hi>Licur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> in the lawes whiche hee gaue to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ordayned that the young menne paſſinge by the olde, ſhoulde doe them greate reuerence: &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the olde dyd ſpeake, then the younger ſhoulde bee ſylent.</p>
                     <p>And he ordained alſo, that if any olde man by caſualtye dyd loſe hys goods and came into extreame pouertie, that he ſhoulde bee ſuſtained of the comon wealth: and that in ſuche ſuſtentacion they ſhoulde haue reſpecte, not onely to ſuccour him for to ſuſtaine hym, but further to geue him to lyue competently. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in hys <hi>Apothegmes</hi> declareth, that <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſoure viſitinge the corners of Rome, founde an olde manne ſittinge at his doore weepinge, and ſheddinge manye teares from hys eyes. And <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſoure demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge hym why hee was ſo euyll handeled, and wherefore he wepte ſo bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, the good olde manne aunſwered hym.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Cato,</hi> the Gods beinge the onelye comfortours, comforte thee in all thy tribulations, ſince thou arte readye to comforte mee at this wofull hower.</p>
                     <p>As well as thou knoweſt that the conſolations of the harte are more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarye, then the phiſike of the bodye: the whiche beeynge applyed ſometymes doeth heale, and an other tyme they doe harme. Beholde my ſcabbed handes, my ſwollen legges, my mouth without teethe, my peeled face, my white beard and my balde heade: for thou beinge (as thou arte,) deſcreete, ſhouldeſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to aſke mee why I weepe.</p>
                     <p>For menne of my age, thoughe they weepe not for the lyttle they feele: yet they ought to weepe for the ouermuche they lyue. The manne which is loden with yeares, tormented with diſeaſes, purſued with enemyes, forgotten of his frendes, viſited with miſhappes, and with euill wyll and pouertie: I knowe not why hee demaundeth long life? For there can be no ſharper reuengeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of vyces, whych we commit: then to geue vs long lyfe.</p>
                     <p>Though now I am aged, I was yong, and if any yong manne ſhould doe me anye iniurye, truelye I would not deſire the gods to take his lyfe, but that they woulde rather prolonge his lyfe. For it is a great pitie, to heare the man (whyche hath lyued longe) account the troubles whiche he hath endured.</p>
                     <p>Knowe thou <hi>Cato,</hi> if thou doeſt not knowe it, that I haue lyued .77. yeares. And in thys tyme, I haue buried my father, my graundefather, twoe Auntes and .5. vncles. After that I had buried .9. ſyſters, and .11. Brethren. I haue buried afterwardes, twoe lawfull wyfes, and fyue bonde women, whyche I haue hadde as my lemmans.</p>
                     <p>I haue buryed alſo .14. chyldren, and .7. maryed doughters: and therewith not contented, I haue buryed .37. Nephues, and .15. Nieces, and that whyche greaueth me moſte of all is, that I haue buryed two frendes of myne, one w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> remained in <hi>Capua,</hi> &amp; the other w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> was reſidente here at Rome. The death of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21411:215"/>
whom hath greued me more, then all thoſe of my aliaunce and parentage. For in the worlde there is no like loſſe to that, where a man loſeth hym whom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierlye he loueth and of whom alſo he is derelye beloued. The fatal deſtenies oughte to content them ſelues, to haue annoyed mye houſe with ſo manye myſfortunes. But after all this, and aboue all this, theye haue lefte me a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nephewe, whiche ſhall bee myne heire, and theye haue lefte vnto mee that all mye life I ſhall lament. O <hi>Cato,</hi> for that thou oweſt to the common wealthe I doe deſire thee, and by the immortall goddes I doe coniure thee, that ſince thou arte a vertuous Romaine, and cenſor of the people, that thou prouyde for one of theſe two thinges, that is to wete, that this mye Nephewe doe ſerue mee, or els ordeine that I dye forthewith. For it is a greate crueltye that thoſe doe purſue me whiche are aliue, ſince it is nowe 40. yeares that I ceaſed not to bewaile the deade. <hi>Cato</hi> beinge well enfourmed of that the olde man had tolde him, and ſince he founde al that true whiche he ſpake, he called vnto his preſence the yonge Nephew, and ſayde vnto him theſe wordes. If thou were ſuche a childe as thou oughteſt to bee, thou ſhouldeſt excuſe mee of payne, and thy ſelfe of trauaile. But ſince it is not ſo, I praye thee take that pacientlye that I ſhall commaunde thee: and be thou aſſured, that I will not commaund thee any thing that ſhalbee againſte iuſtice. For the vicious yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges (as thou art) ought to be more aſhamed of the youthefullnes theye haue commytted: then for the puniſhement whiche is geeuen vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Firſte I commaunde thow bee whipte, beecauſe thou arte dyſobedyent, and troubleſome to thy graundefather,</p>
                     <p>Secondlye I commaunde that thou bee baniſhed the limittes of Rome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou arte a vicious yonge man.</p>
                     <p>Thyrdly, I commaund that of all the goodes thou haſt enherited, thou ſhalt be diſenherited: becauſe thou doeſt not obey thy graundfather.</p>
                     <p>And the cauſe why I geue ſuche ſeuere ſentence is, to the end that from he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forthe the yong ſhal not diſobey the aged, and alſo that thoſe which haue enhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryted great treaſours, ſhall not think that men ſhall permit them to bee more vicious, then others. <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tiraunt wryting to a frend of his which was very aged, ſaid theſe wordes: the which rather ſemed ſpoken of a Philoſopher then of a tirant. I haue meruailed at thee &amp; am offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the my friend <hi>Vet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> to know as I do, that in yeares thou arte verye aged, and in workes verye yonge: and alſo it greeueth mee that thou haſt loſt the credite of knoweledge in the ſchooles. It greeueth mee more, that through thee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priuilege ſhoold be loſt, which the old men haue accuſtomed to haue in <hi>Grece:</hi> that is to wete, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the theeues, all the periured, and all the murderers were more ſure, when by white heares theye ſemed to be olde: when they reteyred to the aulters of the temples. O what goodneſſe, O what wiſedome. what valyauntnes, and what innocencye oughte the aged men to haue in the auncient tyme: ſince in Rome theye honoured them as goddes, and in <hi>Grece</hi> theye priuileged thoſe white heares as the temples. <hi>Plinie</hi> in an epiſtle hee wrote to <hi>Fabatus</hi> ſayeth, that <hi>Pirrus</hi> king of the <hi>Epirotes,</hi> demaunded a philoſopher which was the beſt cytye of the worlde? who aunſwered. The beſt cytye of the worlde, is <hi>Moler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> a place of three hundreth fyers in <hi>Achaia:</hi> beecauſe all the walles are of blacke ſtones, and all thoſe whiche gouerne it haue hoarye heades.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:216"/>And further hee ſayde. Woe bee vnto thee Rome, Woe bee vnto thee <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> woe bee vnto thee <hi>Numancia,</hi> woe bee vnto thee <hi>Egypte,</hi> and woe bee vnto thee <hi>Athens</hi> fyue cytyes whiche count them ſelues for the beſte of the worlde, whereof I am of a contrarye oppynion.</p>
                     <p>For theye auaunte them ſelues to haue whyte walles, and are not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue yonge Senatoures. Thys phyloſopher ſayde verye well, and I thynke noe manne wyll ſaye leſſe then I haue ſayde. Of thys woorde <hi>Senex,</hi> is deryued the name of a Senatoure, for ſo were the gouernoures of Rome named, becauſe the fyrſte Kynge (that was <hi>Romulus</hi>) choſé a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred aged men to gouerne the common wealth, and commaunded, that all the other Romayne youthe ſhoold employe them ſelues to the warres.</p>
                     <p>Since wee haue ſpoken of the honour whyche in the olde tyme was gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the auncient men, it is reaſon wee knowe now, from what yeare they counted men aged, to the ende they ſhoolde bee honoured as aged men. For the makers of lawes, when they hadde eſtabliſhed the honours whych ought to bee done to the aged: dydde aſwell ordeyne, from what daye and yeare, theye ſhoolde beeginne. Dyuers auncyent Philoſophers dyd put ſyx ages, from the tyme of the byrthe of man, till the houre of deathe.</p>
                     <p>That is to wete, chyldehood, which laſteth till ſeuen yeares. Infancy, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che endureth vntill ſeuentene yeares. Youth, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> continueth till thirty yeares. Mannes eſtate, which remayneth till fyftye and fyue yeares. Age whyche endureth till three ſcore and eyghtene yeares. Croked age which remaineth till death. And ſo after man had paſſed fiue and fyftye yeares, they called hym aged. <hi>Aulus Gelius</hi> in his tenth booke, in the xxvii. Chapter ſaieth, that <hi>Tullius Hoſtillius</hi> (who was kynge of the Romaines) determined to count all the old and yonge, whiche were amongeſt the people: and alſo to know whych ſhoold bee called infaunts, whych yong, and whych olde. And there was noe lytle dyfference amongeſt the Romayne Phyloſophers, and in the end it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by the kyng, and the Senate, that men tyll ſeuenteene yeares ſhoold bee called infaunts, and tyll ſyx and forty ſhoold bee called yong, and from ſyx and forty vpwardes they ſhoold bee called olde.</p>
                     <p>If wee wyl obſerue the lawe of the Romaynes, wee know from what ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me wee are bound to call and honor the aged men. But addyng hereunto it is reaſon that the olde men know, to what proweſſes and vertues they are bound, to the ende that wyth reaſon, and not wyth faynyng, they bee ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For ſpeakyng the trueth, yf wee compare duty to duty, they old men are more bound to vertue: then the yong to ſeruice. Wee can not denay, but that all ſtates of natyons (great &amp; ſmall, yong and olde) are bound to bee vertuous: but in this caſe the one is more to bee blamed, then the other.</p>
                     <p>For oftentimes if the yong do offend, it is for that hee wanteth experience: but if the olde man offend, it is for the abundaunce of mallice. <hi>Seneca</hi> in an Epyſtle ſayde theſe woordes. I let thee weete my friend <hi>Lucillus,</hi> that I am very much offended, and I do complayne, not of any friend or foe: but of my ſelfe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                     <p>IT is conſonaunt to the counſayle of <hi>Seneca,</hi> that the aged ſhoulde bee tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in eating, whych they ought to do, not only for the reputacion of their perſons: but alſo for the preſeruacion of their liues. For the olde men which are drunk, and amarous, are perſecuted with their owne diſeaſes, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed by the tonges of other. That whiche the auncient men ſhoulde eate (I meane thoſe, whiche are noble, and vertuous) ought to be verye cleane, &amp; well dreſſed, and aboue all, that theye take it in ceaſon and time: for otherwiſe, to muche eatinge of diuers thinges, cauſeth the yonge to bee ſicke, and enforceth the olde to dye. Yong men though they eate diſhoneſtly, very haſtely, and eate ſpeakinge, we can do no leſſe but diſſemble withe them: but the olde me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whych eate much, and haſtelye, of neceſſitie we oughte to reproue them. For men of honour ought to eate at the table with a great grauitie: as if they were in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye counſaile to determine cauſes. It is not my intention to perſwade the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble olde men not to eate, but to admoniſhe them to eate no more then is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarye. We doe not prohibite them to eate delicate thinges, but to beware of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous thinges. We doe not counſale them to leaue eatinge hauinge nede: but to withdrawe them ſelues from curioſyties. For thoughe it bee lawefull for aged men to eate ſufficiente, it is not honeſte for them to eate to ouercome their ſtomakes. It is a ſhame to wryte it, but more ſhame ought they to haue whiche doe it, whiche is, that the goodes whiche theye haue wonne and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryted by their predeceſſours, theye haue eaten, and dronken: ſo that theye haue neyther bought houſe, vyne, nor yet maried any doughter, but they are naked, and theire poore children goe to the Tauernes and Innes: and the myſerable fathers to the Hoſpitalles, and churches. When anye man commeth to pouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tye, for that his houſe is burned, or his ſhyppe drowned, or that theye haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all from hym by lawe, or that he hath ſpent it in pleadyng againſt hys e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemye, or anye other inconuenience is come vnto hym: mee thinketh wee all are bounde to ſuccoure him, and the harte hathe compaſſion to beeholde hym: but hee that ſpendeth it in apparaile not requyſyte, to ſeeke delitious wynes, and to eate delicate meates, to ſuch one I woulde ſaye, that the pouertye hee ſuffreth is not ſufficiente for his deſertes. For of all troubles there is none ſo greate, as to ſee a man ſuffer the euill, whereof he hymſelfe hathe bene the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. Alſo according to the counſaile of <hi>Seneca,</hi> the auncients ought to be wel aduertiſed, in that they ſhould not onely be temperate in eatyng, but alſo they
<pb facs="tcp:21411:217"/>
ſhoolde be ſober in drinking: and this both for the preſeruacion of their health, and allſo reputacion of theire honeſtye.</p>
                     <p>For if the olde Phiſitions doe not deceiue vs, humaine bodies doe drye and corrupte beecauſe theye drinke ſuperfluouſly, and eate more then nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. If I ſhoulde ſaye vnto the olde menne, that theye ſhoulde drynke no wyne: theye myghte tell mee, that it is not the counſayle of a Chriſtian. But preſuppoſe theye oughte to drynke, and that for noe oppynyon theye ſhoulde leaue it: yet I admonyſhe, exhorte, and deſire them, that theye drynke lytle, and that theye drynke verye temperate.</p>
                     <p>For the diſordynate and immeſurate drynkynge, cauſeth yonge men to bee drunke, and the olde men: bothe drunke and fooliſhe. O howe muche authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye loſte theye, and what grauytye doe honourable and auncient menne loſe, whiche in drynkinge are not ſober. Whyche ſemeth to bee true, for aſmuche as the man beeinge loden wyth wyne, thoughe hee were the wyſeſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde hee ſhoulde bee a verye foole, that woulde take counſayle of ſuche one in hys affaires. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in a booke whiche hee made of the fortune of the Romains ſayed: that in the ſenate of Rome, there was an auncient manne, who made greate exclamacions, that a yonge man hadde in ſuche ſorte diſhonoured him, that for the iniuries he hadde ſpoken, hee deſerued deathe.</p>
                     <p>And when the yonge manne was called for to aunſwere to that hee hadde ſayde vnto hym, he aunſwered. Fathers conſcripte, thoughe I ſeeme yonge vnto you, yet I am not ſo yonge, but that I knewe the father of this olde manne, who was a vertuous and noble Romayne, and ſomewhat a kynne to mee. And I ſeeynge that his father hadde gotten muche goodes fightynge in the warres, and alſo ſeeinge this olde manne ſpending them in eatynge and drinkynge: I ſayde vnto him one daye. I am verye ſorye, my lorde and vncle, for that I heare of thye honour in the market place: and am the more ſorye for that I ſee done in thy houſe, wherein we ſawe fyftye men armed before in one houre, and we nowe ſee a hundreth knaues made drunke.</p>
                     <p>And worſe then that, as thye father ſhewed to all thoſe that entered hys houſe, the enſignes hee hadde wonne in the warres: ſo nowe to thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into thy houſe, thou ſheweſt them dyuers ſortes of wynes. My vncle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned of mee, but in this caſe I make the plaintife iudge, againſte mee the defendaunt. And I woolde by the immortall goddes, hee deſerued noe more payne for hys woorkes: then I deſerue by my woordes.</p>
                     <p>For yf he had bene wyſe, hee woulde haue accepted the correction which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretlye I gaue him: and had not come openly, to declare his faults in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. The complaynte of the olde manne beeinge hearde by the Senate, and the excuſe in lyke manner of the yonge man: they gaue iudgement, that theye ſhoolde take all the goods from the olde manne, and prouyde hym of a tutour whyche ſhoulde gouerne hym and hys houſe.</p>
                     <p>And theye commaunded the tutoure, that from hence forwarde hee ſhoolde not geeue him one cuppe of wyne, ſince hee was noted of drunkenneſſe. Of truth the ſentence whiche the Senate gaue was verye iuſte. For the olde manne whiche geeueth him ſelfe to wyne, hathe aſmuche neede to haue a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernoure, as an infaunte, or a foole. <hi>Laettius</hi> made a booke of the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes of Phyloſophers, and declarethe ſundrye auncyente bankettes,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21411:217"/>
amonge the which he putteth one, where were aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled many greate philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. And admit that the meats were meane, &amp; ſimple: yet the bidden geſtes were ſage. And the cauſe why they did aſſemble, was not to eat: but to diſpute of ſome graue doctrines, whereof the philoſophers did ſomewhat doubte: For in thoſe daies, the greater y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Stoikes &amp; the Peripatetikes were in nomber: ſo much the more were the philoſophers deuided amongeſt them ſelues. When they were ſo aſſembled, truely they did not eate, nor drinke out of meaſure: but ſome pleaſaunt matter was moued betwene the maſters and the ſcollers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene the yong and the olde, that is to wete, which of them coulde declare any ſecrete of phyloſophye, or anye profound ſentence. O happy were ſuch feaſtes, and no leſſe happy were they that thether were bidden.</p>
                     <p>But I am ſory that thoſe whiche nowe byd, and thoſe that are bidden, for a trouth are not as thoſe auncients were. For there are noe feaſtes now adays of phyloſophers, but of gluttons, not to diſpute, but to murmour, not to open doubtfull things, but to talke of the vices of others, not to confirme aunciente amities, but to begynne newe diſſenſions, not to learne any doctrines, but to approue ſome nouelty. And that whiche worſte of all is, that the olde ſtriue at the table with the yonge, not on hym whiche hathe ſpoken the moſte graueſt ſentence: but of hym whyche hathe dronke moſte wyne, and hathe rinſed moſt cuppes. <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> in the hiſtorye of the <hi>Lumbardes</hi> declarethe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> foure olde <hi>Lumbardes</hi> made a banket, in the whiche the one dranke to the others ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and it was in this manner. Theye made defyaunce to drinke two to twoe and after eche man had declared howe many yeres olde he was: the one dra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke as manye times as the other was yeares olde, and likewiſe his companion pledged him. And one of theſe foure companions had at the leaſte. 58. yeares: the ſecond .63 the thyrde .87. the fourthe .812. ſo that a man knowethe not what they did eate in this banket, eyther litle or muche: but we knowe that hee that dranke leaſt, dranke 58. cuppes of wine.</p>
                     <p>Of this ſo euill cuſtome came the <hi>Gothes</hi> to make this lawe, which of manye is reade, and of fewe vnderſtanded, where it ſayeth. We ordeyn and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on payne of deathe, that no olde man drinke to the others yeres being at the table. That was made becauſe they were ſo muche geuen to wyne, that they dranke more ofte, thenne they did eate morſelles. The Prynces and greate Lordes whyche are nowe olde, oughte to bee verye ſober in drinkynge, ſynce theye oughte greatlye to be regarded and honoured of the yonge.</p>
                     <p>For ſpeakinge the truthe, and withe libertie, whan the olde man ſhallbee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wine, he hath more neceſſitie that the yong man leade him by the arme to his houſe: then that hee ſhoulde take of his cappe vnto hym or ſpeake vnto hym with reuerence. Alſo prynces and greate lordes oughte to be verye circumſpecte, that whenne theye become aged, theye bee not noted for yonge, in the apparayle whiche theye weare: For althoughe that for wearinge a fyne and riche garmente, the prynce dothe not enriche or enpoueriſhe his common wealthe: yet we cannot denye, but that it dothe much for the reputacion of his perſone. For the vanytie and curioſitie of garments, dothe ſhewe great light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of minde. According to the varietye of ages, ſo ought the diuerſitie of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraile to bee, whiche ſemethe to bee verye cleare, in that the yonge maydes are attyred in one ſorte, the maried women of an other ſorte, the widdowes of
<pb facs="tcp:21411:218"/>
an other. And lykewiſe I woulde ſaye, that the apparayle of children oughte to be of one ſorte, thoſe of yonge men of an other, and thoſe of olde men of an other, whyche oughte to bee more honeſter then all.</p>
                     <p>For men of hoarye heades, oughte not to be adourned withe precious garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: but withe verteous workes. To goe cleanlye, to be well apparayled, and to be well accompanied, we doe not forbydde the olde, eſpeciallye thoſe whych are noble, and valyaunt men: but to goe to fine, to go with great traynes, and to goe verye curious, wee doe not allowe. Let the olde men pardon mee, for it is not the office but of yonge fooles: For the one ſheweth honeſtye, and the other lightnes. It is a confuſion to tell it, but it is greater ſhame to doe it, that is to weete, that manye olde men of oure time take noe ſmall felicitye, to put caules on theire heades, euerye manne to weare iewels on theire neckes, to laye theire cappes withe agglettes of golde, to ſeeke oute dyuers inuencions of mettall to loade theire fingers wythe riche ringes, to goe perfumed wythe odiferous fauoures, to weare newe faſhioned apparayle, and fynallye I ſaye, that thoughe theire face bee full of wrincles, they can not ſuffer one wrincle to be in theire gowne. All the auncient hiſtoriens, accuſe <hi>Quintus Hottenſius</hi> the Romayne, for that euerye tyme when hee made hym ſelfe readye, he hadde a glaſſe beefore hym: and as muche ſpace and tyme had hee to ſtreyghten the plaites of his gowne: as a woman hadde to trymme the heares of her heade. This <hi>Quintus Hortenſius</hi> beinge Conſul, goynge by chaunce one day through Rome, in a narrowe ſtreat met wythe the other Conſul, where throughe the ſtreightnes of the paſſage the plaightes of his gowne weare vndone: vppon whych occaſion hee complayned to the ſenate of the other Conſull, that he had done hym a greate iniurye, ſayinge that he deſerued to loſe hys lyfe. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoure of all this is <hi>Macrobius:</hi> in the thyrde booke of the <hi>Saturnales.</hi> I can not tell if I be deceiued, but we maye ſaye, that al the curioſitye that olde men haue to goe fine, wel appareled, and cleane, is for no other thinge but to ſhake of age, and to pretende righte to youthe. What a griefe is it to ſee dyuers aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men, the whiche as ripe figges do fal: and on the other ſide it is a wonder to ſee howe in theire age they make them ſelues yonge. In this caſe I ſaye, woulde to god we might ſee them hate vices, and not to complaine of the yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res which theye haue. I praye and exhorte princes and greate lordes, whom oure ſoueraigne lorde hathe permitted to come to age, that theye doe not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe to be aged. For ſpeaking the truthe, the man whiche hathe enuye to ſeeme olde, doth delight to liue in the lightnes of youthe. Alſo man of honour oughte to be verye circumſpecte, for ſo muche as after theye are beecome aged, theye bee not ſuſpected of theire friends, but that both vnto their friends &amp; foes, they be counted faythfull. For a lye in a yonge mannes mouthe, is but a lye: but in the mouthe of an olde manne: it is a heynous blaſphemye. Prynces and great lordes after they are become aged, of one ſorte they oughte to vſe them ſelues to geue, and of thother to ſpeake. For good prynces oughte to ſell woordes by weighte, and geeue rewardes withoute meaſure. The auncient oftentymes complayne, ſayinge, that the yonge will bee not conuerſaunt with them: and truely if there be anye faulte therin, it is of them ſelues. And the reaſon is, that if ſometimes theye doe aſſemble togethers to paſſe awaye the tyme, if the olde man ſet a talkinge he neuer maketh an ende. So that a diſcrete man had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21411:218"/>
go .xii. miles on foote: then to heare an olde man talke three houres. If with ſuch efficacie wee perſwade olde men, that they be honeſt in theire ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraile: for a truthe we will not geue them licence to be diſſolute in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, ſins there is a great difference to note ſome man in his apparaile, or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him to bee malicious or a bablet. For to weare riche apparayle, iniuryeth fewe: but iniurious wordes hurte manye. <hi>Macrobius</hi> in the firſte booke of the dreames of <hi>Scipio,</hi> declareth of a philoſopher named <hi>Crito,</hi> who liued a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and fiue yeares: and till fyltye yeares he was farre oute of courſe: Butte after he came to bee aged, he was ſo well meaſured in his eatynge &amp; drinking, and ſo ware in his ſpeache, that they neuer ſawe him doe any thinge worthye reprehenſion: nor heard him ſpeake worde, but was worthy of notynge. On this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we would geue lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to many, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> till fifty yeres they ſhould be yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g: ſo that from thence forth they would be clothed as olde men, ſpeake as old me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; they ſhould eſteme them ſelues to be olde. But I am ſorye that al the ſpring time dothe paſſe in flower, and afterwardes they fall into the graue as rotten, before they finde any time to pull them out. The olde doe complain y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the yong doe not take theire aduiſe: and theire excuſe herein is, that in theire wordes theye are to longe. For if a manne doe demaunde an olde man his opynion in a caſe, immediatelye hee will beginne to ſaye, that in the life of ſuche, and ſuche kynges and lordes of good memorye, this was done, and this was prouyded. So that when a yonge man aſke them counſaile, howe he ſhall behaue hym ſelfe with the lyuinge: the olde man beginneth to declare vnto him, the life of thoſe whiche bee dead.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon whye the olde men deſire to ſpeake ſo longe is that ſince for theire age they can not ſee, nor goe, nor eate, nor ſlepe, they woulde that al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tyme theire members weare occupyed to doe their duties, al that time theire tonge ſhoulde be occupied to declare of theire times paſt. All this being ſpoken, what more is to ſay I knowe not, but that we ſhould contente oure ſelues, that the olde men ſhoulde haue theire fleſhe as muche puniſhed: as they haue their to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> talke martired. Though it be very vile for a yong man to ſpeak, &amp; ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a yonge manne not to ſaye the truthe: yet this vice is muche more to be abhorred in old princes, &amp; other noble &amp; worſhipful me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ought not only to thynke it theire dutie to ſpeake truthe, but alſo to puniſhe the enemies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For otherwiſe the noble and valyaunt knyghtes ſhoulde not loſe a lytle of theire aucthoritie, if a manne ſawe on theire heades but white heares, and in theire mouthes founde nothing but lyes.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21411:219"/>
and of al thoſe which come hither, I demaunde of your healthe. And doe not demaunde of others, howe well, and howe muche I loue you, but of your own proper hartes: and if your harte ſaye that I am a feyned friende, then I take my ſelfe condempned. If perchaunce youre hartes dothe tell you that I loue you, beinge true in dede that I hate you, or if I tell you that I hate you, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge true that I loue you: of truthe I woulde plucke ſuche a harte oute of my body, and giue it to be eaten of the beaſtes. For there is noe greater dyſceyte, then that whiche the man doth to him ſelfe. If a ſtraunger begile me, I ought to diſſemble it: if an enemie deceiue mee, I ought to reuenge it: if mye fryend miſuſe me, I oughte to complayne of hym: but if I doe deceiue my ſelfe: wyth whom ſhall I comforte my ſelfe? For there is no pacience that can ſuffer the hart to deceyue him ſelfe in anye thinge, whiche he hathe not deepely conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Peraduenture ye will ſaye that I doe not eſteame you, and that I haue not written any letter vnto you of long time. To this I aunſwere. That you doe not attrybute the faulte to mye neglygence, but to the greate diſtaunce of Countreis that there is from hence to Rome: &amp; alſo to the greate affayres of <hi>Aſia,</hi> For amongeſt other diſcommodities the warre hath this alſo, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priueth vs of the ſweete conuerſacion of our countrey.

And ſins you haue alwaies knowen of me, what you deſired to know, I haue eſpied in you others that, whiche of force I muſt ſpeake. For in the end I haue not ſene any poſſeſſe ſo much, to be worthe ſo much, to know ſo much, nor in all things to be ſo mighty, but that one day he ſhoulde neede his poore friende. The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſayde, and allſo well, that the manne whyche lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uethe with his hart, neyther in abſence forgetteth, neyther in preſence becom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth negligent, neither in proſperitie he is proude, nor yet in aduerſitie abiect, neyther he ſerueth for profite, nor yet he loueth for gayne: and fynallye he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendethe the caſe of his friende as his owne. Diuers haue beene the opinions whiche the auncients helde to affirme for what ende friendes were taken, and in the ende they were fully reſolued, that for .4. cauſes we ought to choſe frin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. The firſt we ought to haue friendes, to treate and be conuerſant with all: for according to the troubles of this life, there is no time ſo pleaſauntlye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, as in the conuerſacion of an aſſured friende. The ſeconde is, we ought to haue friendes to whom we may diſcloſe the ſecretes of our hartes for it ys muche comforte to the wofull harte, to declare to his fryende his doubtes, if he perceiue that he doth fele them in deede. The thirde, we oughte to ſearche and choſe friendes, to thend they helpe vs in oure aduerſities. For litle profytethe it my harte that with teares the friendes doe heare all that I bewaile, onleſſe afterwardes in dede he will take paines to refourme the ſame.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, we ought to ſeke and preſerue frindes to thend they be protectors of our goodes, and likewiſe iudges of our euilles: for the good frinde is no leſſe bound to withdrawe vs from the vices, whereby we are ſclaundered: then to deliuer vs from our enemies, by whom we may be ſlayne. The ende whye I tolde you all thys was, if that in this letter you chaunce to lyghte of any ſharpe worde, that you take it pacientlye, conſiderynge that the loue whych I beare yowe, dothe moue mee to ſpeake, and the faythe whyche I owe vnto you, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the not ſuffer mee that I ſhoulde keepe it cloſe.

I come therefore to ſhewe the matter, and I beſeche the immortall goddes that there bee noe more then that whiche was tolde mee, and that it bee leſſe then I ſuſpecte. <hi>Gaius Furius</hi> youre kinſman and my eſpeciall friende, as hee went to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme of <hi>Paleſtyne,</hi> and <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> came to ſee mee in <hi>Antioche,</hi> and hathe tolde mee newes of Italy and Rome, and among others, one aboue al the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidewe I haue committed to memorye, at the whiche I coolde not refraine laughinge, and leſſe to bee troubled after I hadde thought of it. O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye thinges doe wee talke in geſt, the whiche after wee haue well conſidered, geeue occaſion to be ſorye. The emperoure <hi>Adrian</hi> mye good lorde, had a Ieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whoſe name was <hi>Belphus</hi> yonge, comelye, and ſtoute, allbeeit hee was verye malicious as ſuche are accuſtomed to bee: and whiles the imbaſſadours of <hi>Germaine</hi> ſupped with the Emperour in greate ioye, the ſame <hi>Belphus</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ieſt of euery one that was preſent, according to his accuſtomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with a certeine malicious grace. And <hi>Adrian</hi> perceiuing that ſome chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged colour, others murmured, and others weare angrye, hee ſaide vnto thys Ieſter, frinde <hi>Belphus</hi> if thou loue mee and mye ſeruice, vſe not theſe ſpytefull ieſtes at our ſupper, which being conſidered on, may turne vs to euil reſt in our beddes. <hi>Gaius Furius</hi> hath tolde me ſo many ſlaunders chaunced in Italy, ſuch nouelties done in Rome, ſuch alteracion of our Senate, ſuch contentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſtrife betwene our neighbours, ſuche lightnes of yow twoo, that I was aſtonied to here it, &amp; aſhamed to writ it. And it is nothing to tell after what ſort he told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto me, onleſſe you had ſene how earneſtly he ſpake them, imagining y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as he told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without taking anye paine, ſo did I receiue them (as he thought) with out any griefe: though in deede euerye woorde that he ſpake, ſeemed a ſharpe percinge arrowe vnto my hart. For oft times ſome telleth vs thynges, as of ſmall importaunce, the whiche do pricke our hartes to the quicke By the oppy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nion of all, I vnderſtande that you are verye olde, and yet in your owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies, you ſeame verye yonge. And further theye ſaye, that you apparell youre ſelues a newe nowe, as thoughe preſentlye you came into the worlde: &amp; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer they ſaye that you are offended with nothinge ſo muche, as when theye call you olde, &amp; that in theaters where comedies are played, and in the fieldes where the brute beaſtes do runne, you are not the hindmoſt, and that there is no ſport nor lightnes inuented in Rome, but firſt is regiſtred in youre houſe. And finally they ſay that you geue your ſelues ſo to pleaſures, as thoughe you neuer thought to receiue diſpleaſures. O <hi>Claude</hi> and <hi>Claudine,</hi> by the god <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> I ſweare vnto you, that I am a ſhamed of your vnſhamefaſtnes, &amp; am greatly abaſhed of your maners, and aboue all, I am excedingly greeued for your great offence. For at that time that you ought to lift vp your handes, yow are returned againe into the filth of the world Many thinges men commyt, which though they ſeme graue: yet by moderacion of the perſon that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, they are made light, but ſpeaking according to the trouthe, I fynde one reaſon, wherebye I mighte excuſe youre lightnes, but to the contrarye I ſee tenne wherebye I maye condempne youre follyes. <hi>Solon</hi> the phyloſopher in hys lawes ſayde to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that if the yonge offended, hee ſhoulde bee gentlye admoniſhed, and grieuouſlye puniſhed, beecauſe hee was ſtrong:
<pb facs="tcp:21411:220"/>
and if the olde dydde erre, he ſhoulde be lightlye puniſhed, and ſharpelye ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, ſithe he was weake, and feble. To this <hi>Licurgus</hi> in his lawes to the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> ſayde contrarye, that if the yonge did offende, hee ſhoulde bee lightly puniſhed, and greuouſly admoniſhed, ſins through ignoraunce he dyd erre: and the olde manne whiche did euill, ſhoulde be lightly admoniſhed, and ſharpely puniſhed, ſins through malice he did offend. Theſe two phyloſophers being (as theye haue bene) of ſuche authoritie in the worlde that is paſte, and conſideringe that their lawes and ſentences were of ſuche weighte: it ſhoulde be muche raſheneſſe in not admittinge the one of them. Nowe not receyuyng the one, nor reprouynge the other, mee thynketh that there is greate excuſe to the yonge for theire ignoraunce, and greate condempnacion othe aged for theire experience. Once agayne I retourne to ſaye that you pardone me, mye friendes, and you oughte not greatlye to weye it, thoughe I am ſomewhat ſharpe in condempnation, ſince you others are ſo diſſolute in youre liues: for of youre blacke lyfe, mye penne dothe take ynke. I remember well that I haue harde of thee <hi>Claude,</hi> that thou haſte bene luſty and couragious in thye youthe: ſo that thye ſtrengthe of all was enuyed, and the beauty of <hi>Claudine</hi> of all men was deſired. I will not write vnto you in this letter, mye frindes and neigheboures, neither reduce to memorye, howe thou <hi>Claude</hi> haſte imployed thy forces in the ſeruice of the common wealth: and thou <hi>Claudine</hi> haſt wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne muche honoure of thy beautye: for ſundrye tymes it chaunced, that men of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nye goodlye gyftes, are noted of greuous offences. Thoſe whiche ſtriued with thee are all dead, thoſe whom thow deſiredſt are dead, thoſe which ſerued thee <hi>Claudine</hi> are deade, thoſe whiche before thee <hi>Claudine</hi> ſighed, are deade: thoſe which for thee died, are nowe dead: and ſins all thoſe are dead withe theyre lightneſſe, do not you others thinke to dye, &amp; your follyes allſo? I demaunde nowe of thy youthe one thinge, and of thy beauty another thinge, what do you receiue of theſe paſtimes, of theſe good interteinmentes, of theſe abundances, of theſe great contentacions, of the pleaſures of the worlde, of the vanytye that is paſte, and what hope you of all theſe to carye into the narrowe graue? O ſimple, ſimple, and ignoraunt perſones, howe oure life conſumeth, and we perceiue not howe we liue therein. For it is no felicitie to enioy a ſhort, or long life: but to knowe to employe the ſame well, or euill. O children of the earthe, and diſciples of vanytie, nowe you knowe that tyme flyethe without mouing his wynges, the life goeth without liftinge vppe hys feete, the worlde diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs not tellinge vs the cauſe, men beegile vs not mouinge theire lippes, our fleſh conſumeth to vs vnwares, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart dieth hauing no remedy, &amp; finally our glory decayeth as if it had neuer bene, and death oppreſſeth vs wythoute knockinge at the doore. Thoughe a man be neuer ſo ſimple, or ſo very a foole: yet he can not denaye, but it is impoſſible to make a fier in the botome of the ſea, to make a waye in the ayre, of the thinne bloude to make roughe ſinewes, and of the ſofte vaines to make harde bones. I meane that it is vnpoſſible, that the grene flower of youthe, be not one daye withered by age.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21411:221"/>
When I ſawe the worlde braue, I ſerued him, when hee ſawe mee ſadde, hee flattered mee, when I ſawe him wealthy, I aſked him, when he ſaw mee me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, hee begiled me, when I deſired anye thinge, he holpe mee to atteine to it, &amp; afterwards when the ſame I beſt enioyed, then he toke it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mee, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw me not pleaſed, he vyſited me, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw me, he forgot me, when he ſaw me ouerthrowen, he gaue me his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to releue me, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaw me exalted, he tripped me again to ouerthrow me. Fynally, when I think that I haue ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the world, I fynd y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all that I haue is a burden. Yf thys which I haue ſpoken of the world be anye thinge, more is that a great deale which yet of my ſelfe I will ſaye, whiche is, that without doubte my follye is greater, then his mallice, ſince I am begiled ſo ofte, and yet allwaies I followe the deceiuer O worlde, worlde, thou haſt ſuche moodes and faſhions in thy procedyng, that thou leadeſt vs all to perdicion. Of one thinge I maruaile muche, whereof I cannot be ſatiſfied. Which is, ſince that we may go vpon the bridge, &amp; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any gaine we doe wade through the water, &amp; where as the ſhallow is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, we ſeke to ronne into the golfe, and where the way is drye, wee go into the plaſhe, where we may eate wholſome meates to noriſhe the lyfe, wee receiue poyſon to haſten deathe, we ſeke to deſtroy oure ſelues, where as we may bee without daunger. Fynallye I ſay, without profite we commit a fault, thoughe wee ſee with our eyes the pain to follow. Wiſe men ought circumſpectly to ſee what they do, to examine that they ſpeake, to proue that theye take in hande to beware whoſe company they vſe, and aboue all, to knowe whom they truſt. For our iudgement is ſo corrupt, that to begile vs, one is ynough: and to make vs not to be diſceiued, tenne thoſande woolde not ſuffiſe. They haue ſo greate care of vs, I meane the worlde to beegile vs, and the fleſhe to flatter vs, that the highe way beinge as it is narrowe, the patheway daungerous, and full of prickes, the iorney is longe, &amp; the lyfe ſhorte: our bodies are neuer but loden w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vices, &amp; our hartes but full of cares. I haue wondered at dyuers things in this worlde, but that which aſtonieth me moſt is, that thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be good, we make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beleue they are euill: and thoſe whiche are euel, we perſwade others to beleue that they are good. So that wee ſhoote at the white of vertues, &amp; hit the butte of vices. I will confeſſe one thinge, the whiche beinge diſcloſed, I know that infamye will follow me, but paraduenture ſome vertuous man will marueile at it, that is, that in thoſe two and fiftye yeares of my lyfe, I haue proued all the vices of this worlde, for no other intent, but for to proue if there bee anye thynge, where in mannes mallice might be ſatiſfyed. And afterwardes, all well conſidered, al examined, and all proued, I fynde, that the more I eate, the more I dye for hunger, the more I drinke, the greater thirſte I haue, the more I reſt, the more I am broken, the more I ſlepe, the more drouſier I am, the more I haue, the more I couet, the more I deſire, the more I am torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the more I procure, the leſſe I attaine. Fynally I neuer hadde ſo greate paine through want, but afterwarde I had more trouble with exceſſe. It is a great follye to thinke that as longe as a man lyueth in this fleſhe, that hee can ſatiſfye the fleſhe: for at the laſt caſt ſhe may take from vs our lyfe, but wee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can not take from her her diſordynate couetouſnes. Yf men dyd ſpeake with the goddes, or the gods were conuerſant with men, the firſt thing that I woold aſke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhoold be, why they haue appointed an end to our woful dayes:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21411:221"/>
and wyl not geue vs an end of our wicked deſires? O cruel Gods, what is it you do? or what do you ſuffer vs? it is certain, that we ſhal not paſſe one good day of life only, but in taſting this, and that, life conſumeth. O intollerable life of man, wherin there are ſuch malices from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which we ought to beware, and ſuch perils to fal in, and alſo ſo many thinges to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſyder, that then both ſhe and we do end to know our ſelues when the houre of death approcheth. Let thoſe knowe that knowe not, that the world taketh our wil, and we others like ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norauntes cannot denay it hym, and afterwardes hauing power of our wil, doth conſtraine vs to that which we would not: ſo that many times we would do vertuous workes, and for that we are now put into the worldes handes, we dare not doe it. The world vſeth another ſubtiltye with vs, that to the end wee ſhould not ſtriue with it, it prayſeth the times paſt, becauſe we ſhould liue according to the time preſent. And the worlde ſaieth further, that if we others employ our forces in his vices, he geueth vs licence that we haue a good deſire of vertue. O woulde to god in my dayes I myghte ſee, that the care whiche the worlde hath to preſerue vs, the wordlyngs would take it to withdraw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from hys vyces. I ſweare that the gods ſhoulde then haue more ſeruauntes and the world and the fleſhe ſhould not haue ſo many ſlaues.</p>

I do remember alſo, that this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nius Priſcus</hi> was ſenatour one yeare: and bycauſe he woulde not ſeeme aged, but deſired that men ſhoulde iudge hym too bee yonge: he ſhaued his bearde and hys heade, which was not accuſtomed amonge the ſenatours nor Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of Rome. And as one day amongeſt the other Senatours he entred into the hyghe Capitolle, one ſayde vnto hym. Tell me man, from whence co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt thou? What wylte thou? and why comeſt thou hither? howe durſte thou being no ſenatour enter into the Senate? he aunſwered. I am <hi>Annius priſcus</hi> the aged, howe chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth it that nowe you haue not knowen me? they replyed vnto hym, if thou werte <hi>Annius Priſcus</hi> thou woldeſt not come thus ſhauen. For in this ſacred ſenate can none enter to gouerne the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth: vnleſſe his parſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be endued with vertues, and his heade with white heares, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art baniſhed and depriued of thy office. For the olde which lyue as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yong, ought to be puniſhed. Thou knoweſt wel <hi>Claude,</hi> and <hi>Claudine,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that which I haue ſpoken, is not the faynyng of <hi>Homere,</hi> neither a fable of <hi>Ouide,</hi> but that you your ſelues ſaw it with your eyes, and in his baniſhment I dyd helpe him with money, and more ouer he was baniſhed another time for the lightnes he dyd commit in the nighte in the citye, and I meruaile not hereof: for we ſee by experyence, that old men whiche are fleaſhed in vices, are more obſtinate to correct then the yong. O what euill fortune haue the olde men, which ſuffered them ſelues too waxe olde in vyces: for more daungerous is the fier in an old houſe, then in a new, and a greate cut of a ſworde is not ſo perilous, as a rotten fiſtule. Though old men were not honeſt and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, for the ſeruice of the gods and the common wealth, for the ſaieng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, nor for the example of the yong: yet he ought to be honeſt, yf it weare but for the reuerence of their yeares. If the pore old man haue noe teeth, how ſhall he eate? If he haue no heate in his ſtomacke, howe can he dyſgeſt? If he haue no taſte, how can he drinke? if hee be not ſtrong, howe can he be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterer? If hee haue no feete, howe can he goe? If hee haue the palſy, howe can hee ſpeake? if hee haue the goute in his handes howe can hee play. Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, ſuche lyke wordlye and vicyous men, haue employed their forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge yonge, deſirous to proue al theſe vices: and when they are old it greueth them extreamelye that they can not as yet acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ppliſhe their deſiers.</p>
                     <p>Amongeſt all the faultes in old men (in my opinion) this is the chefeſt, that ſince they haue proued al thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, that they ſhoold ſtil remaine in their obſtinat folly. There is no parte but they haue trauailed, no villany but they haue aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed, no fortune but they haue proued, no good but they haue perſecuted, no euyl but hath chaunced vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor there is any vice but they haue attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Theſe vnhappy men which in this ſorte haue ſpent all their youth, haue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end their combes cut with infirmities, &amp; diſeaſes: yet they are not ſomuch greued with the vices (which in them do abound) to hinder them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertues, as they are tormented for wante of corporall courage, to further them in their
<pb facs="tcp:21411:223"/>
luſts. O if wee were gods, or that they would geeue vs licence to know the thoughts of the old, as wee ſee with our eies the deeds of the yong I ſwear: to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God <hi>Mars,</hi> and alſo to the mother <hi>Berecinthe,</hi> that without compariſon, we woold puniſhe more the wicked deſiers which the aged haue to be wicked: then the light deeds of the yong. Tel mee <hi>Claude,</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> 
                        <hi>Claudine,</hi> do you think though you behaue your ſelues as yong, you ſhall not ſeme to bee old? know you not that our nature is the corruption of our body, and that our body hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth our vnderſtandings, and that the vnderſtandyngs are kept of our ſoule, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> oure ſoule is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother of deſiers &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our deſiers are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcourge of our youth, &amp; that our youth, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enſigne of our age &amp; age the ſpye of death, &amp; that death in the end is the houſe where life taketh hys herber, and from whence youth flyeth a fote, and from whence age can not eſcape a horſback? I woold reioyce that you <hi>Claude,</hi> and <hi>Claudine,</hi> woolde tell me what you fynde in lyfe that ſomuche therwith you ſhould bee contented: ſince now you haue paſſed foure ſcore yeares of lyfe, duryng the which tyme either you haue been wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in the world, or els you haue been good. Yf you haue been good, you ought to think it long vntil you be with the good gods: if you haue been euil, it is iuſt you dye, to the end you bee no worſe. For ſpeaking the truth, thoſe which in .3. ſcore &amp; 10 yeares haue been wicked in woorks, leaue ſmal hope of their ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of lyfe. <hi>Adrian</hi> my lord, being at <hi>Nola</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> one brought vnto him a nephew of his from the ſtudy, where as the yong child had not profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a lytel: for hee became a great Gretian and latineſt, and more ouer he was faire, gratious, wiſe &amp; honeſt. And this Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> loued his nephew ſo much, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee ſaied vnto him theſe woords My nephew, I know not whither I ought to ſay vnto thee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou art good, or euil: for if thou be euill, lyfe ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee euyl imployd on thee, and if thou bee good, thou oughteſt to die imediatly, and becauſe I am woors the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, I liue lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then all. Theſe woordes which <hi>Adrian</hi> my lord ſayed, doe plainely declare and expreſſe, that in ſhort ſpace y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pale and cruel death doth aſſaulte the good, and le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthneth life a great while to the euil. The opinion of a philoſopher was, that the gods are ſo profound in their ſecrets, high in their miſteryes, and ſo iuſt in their woorks, that to men which leaſt profit the common wealth, they lengthen lyfe longeſt: and though he had not ſayd it, we others ſee it by experience. For the man which is good, and that beareth great zeale and frendſhip to the common wealth, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the gods take him from vs, or the enemies do ſley him, or the daungers doe caſt him away, or the the trauailes do finiſh him. When great <hi>Pompeius</hi> &amp; <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> became enemyes, &amp; from that enmite came to cruel warres, the cronicles of that time declare, that the kings and people of the occidental part became in the fauour of <hi>Iulius Ceſar,</hi> and the mightieſt &amp; moſt puiſaunte of al the oriental parts, came in the ayd of great <hi>Pompeius,</hi> beecauſe theſe two Princes were loued of few, and ſerued and feared of al. Amongſt the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and ſundry nations of people, which came out of the oriental part, into the hoſt of the great <hi>Pompeius,</hi> one nation came maruelous cruel &amp; barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, which ſayd they dwelled in the other ſide of the mountayns Riphees, which go vnto <hi>India.</hi> And theſe barbarous had a cuſtome, not to liue no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then fifty years: &amp; therfore when thei came to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> age, they made a greater
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21411:223"/>
fier and were burned therin aliue, and of their owne willes they ſacrificed them ſelues to the gods. Let no man bee aſtoined at that wee haue ſpoken but rather let them maruel of that wee wyl ſpeak (that is to ſay) that the ſame day that any man had accompliſhed fifty years, immediatly hee caſt him ſelf quick in to the fier, and the parents, children, and his freends, made a great feaſt. And the feaſt was, that they did eat the fleaſh of the dead half burned, and drank in wyne and water the aſſhes of his bones: ſo that the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mak of the children beeing aliue, was the graue of the fathers beeing dead. All this that I haue ſpoken with my toung, <hi>Pompeius</hi> hath ſeen with his eies for that ſome beeing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> camp did accompliſh fifty years, &amp; bycauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſe was ſtraunge, hee declared it oft times in the Senate. Let euery man iudge in this caſe what hee will, and condemne the barbarous at his pleaſure, yet I wyll not ceaſe too ſay what I think. O golden world, which had ſuch men. O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people, of whom in the world to come ſhalbee a perpetuall memory. What conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of world? what forgetfulnes of him ſelf? what ſtroke of fortune? what whip for the fleſh? what litell regard of lyfe? O what bridell for the veruous? O what confuſion for thoſe that loue lyfe? O how great example haue they left vs, not to feare death? Sithens thoſe heeare haue wyllingly diſpiſed their own liues, it is not to bee thought that they died to take the goods of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, neither to think that our life ſhoold neuer haue end, nor our couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in like maner. O glorious people, and .10. thouſand ſold happy, that the proper ſenſuallyty beeing forſaken, hath ouercome the natural appetyte to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to liue, not beeleeuing in that they ſaw, and that hauing faith in that they neuer ſaw, they ſtriued with the fatall deſtines. By the way they aſſalted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune they, chaunged life for death, they offred the body to death, and aboue al haue woon honor with the gods, not for that they ſhould haſten death, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhould take away that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is ſuperfluus of life. <hi>Archagent</hi> a ſurgio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Rome, and <hi>Anthonius Muſus,</hi> a phiſition of the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Eſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius</hi> father of the phiſick, ſhoold get litel mony in that country.

                     <p>BVt returning now to thee <hi>Claude,</hi> &amp; to thee <hi>Claudine</hi> mee thinketh, that theſe barbarous beeing fifty years of age, and you others hauing aboue thre ſcore and 10. it ſhould bee iuſt, that ſithens you were elder in years you were equal in vertue, and though (as they) you wyl not accept death pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently: yet at the leaſt you ought to amend your euel liues willingly. I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that it is many years ſithens that <hi>Fabritius</hi> the yong, ſonne of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>britius</hi> the old, had ordeyned to haue deceiued mee, of the which if you had not
<pb facs="tcp:21411:224"/>
told mee, great inconueniences had hapned: and ſithens that you did mee ſo great a benefit, I woold now requite you the ſame with an other like. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt frends there is no equal benifit, then to deceyue the deceyuer. I let you know, if you doo not know it, that you are poore aged folks, your eyes are ſoonk into your heads, the noſtrels are ſhutt, the hears are white, the hearing is loſt, the tonge faltreth, the teeth fall, the face is wrincled, the feete ſwoln, &amp; the ſtomak cold. Finally I ſay, that if the graue could ſpeak, as vnto his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, by iuſtice hee myght commaund you to inhabit his houſe. It is great pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the yong men, and of their youthfull ignorante, for then vnto ſuch their eyes are not opened, to know the miſhaps of this miſerable life, when cruell death doth end their dayes, and adiorneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the graue. <hi>Plato</hi> in his book of the common wealth ſayd, that in vaine wee geeue good counſels, to fond &amp; light yongmen. For youth is without experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of that it knoweth, ſuſpicious of that it heareth, incredible of that is told him, deſpiſing the counſayl of an o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, and very poore of his own. Forſomuch as this is true that I tell you <hi>Claude,</hi> and <hi>Claudine,</hi> that without compariſon, the ignorance which the yong haue of the good is not ſo much: but the obſtinacion which the old hath in the euel is more. For the mortal gods many times do diſſemble with a .1000. offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces committed by ignorance, but they neuer forgeeue the offence perpetrated by malice. O <hi>Claude,</hi> and <hi>Claudine,</hi> I doo not meruel that you doo forget the gods (as you doo) which created you, and your fathers, which beegot you and your pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which haue loued you and your frends, which haue honored you: but that which moſt I maruel at is, that you forget your ſelues. For you ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider what you ought to bee, vntil ſuch time as you bee there where you would not bee, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without power to return back again. Awake, awake, ſince you are drownd in your dreams, open your eyes ſince you ſlepe ſo much, accuſtom your ſelues to trauells, ſithens you are vacabonds, learne that which beehoueth you ſithens now you are ſo old. I mean, that in time conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient you agree with death, beefore he make execution of life .52. yers haue I known the things of the world, &amp; yet I neuer ſaw a woman ſo aged through years, nor old man with members ſo feble, that for want of ſtrength could not (if they liſt) doo good: nor yet for the ſame occaſion ſhoold leaue to bee euel if they liſt to bee euel. It is a meruelous thing to ſee, and woorthy to note that al the corporal members of man waxeth old, but the inward hart, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tonge: for the hart is always green to inuent euils, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> toung is alwais able to tel lies. My opinion ſhould bee that the pleaſant ſomer being paſt, you ſhoold prepare your ſelues for the vntemperat winter which is at hand. And if you haue but few days to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinew, you ſhoold make haſt to take vp your lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. I mean that ſith you haue paſſed the days of your life with trauel, you ſhoold prepare your ſelues againſt the night of death, to bee in the hauen of reſt. Let mockries paſſe as mockries, and accept truth as truth, that is to weete, that it were a very iuſt thing, and alſo for your honor neceſſary, that al thoſe which in times paſt haue ſeene you yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g &amp; fooliſh, ſhoold now in your age, ſe you graue and ſage. For there is nothing that ſo much forgetteth the lightnes and folly of the youth, as dooth grauity and conſtancy in age. When the knight ronneth his carire, they blame him not for that the horſe mayn is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:21411:224"/>
not finely commed: but at the end of his race hee ſhoold ſee his horſe ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded and looked to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what greater confuſion can bee to any parſon, or greater ſclau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our mother Rome, then to ſee that which now adays therin wee ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to weete, the old which can ſcarcely creap through the ſtreats, to beehold the plays and games as yong men, which ſerch nought ells but pomp and vanity. It greeueth mee to ſpeak it, but I am much more aſhamed to ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old Romayns do dayly cauſe the white hears to be plucked out of their heads bicauſe they would not ſeeme old, to make their berd ſmall to ſeme yong, wea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring their hoſen very cloſe, theyr ſherts open beefore, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gown of the ſenatour imbrodred, the Romayn ſigne richly enameled, the coller of gold at the neck, as thoſe of <hi>Dace.</hi> Fringes in their gowns, as thoſe of <hi>Saphire,</hi> hoopes in their hatts, as the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and perles on their fingers, as thoſe of <hi>India.</hi> What wilt thou I tell thee more, then I haue told thee, but that they weare their gowns long and large, as thoſe of <hi>Tharenthe,</hi> and they wear theim of the colour as men of warr, and euery weeke they haue chaunge as players, and the woorſt of all is, that they ſhow them ſelues as doting in loue now in their age, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue doon hertofore in their youth. That old men are ouercom by yong deſires, I do not meruel, for that brutiſh luſt is as natural, as the daily foode: but the old men (being old men) ſhould be ſo diſſolute, heerewith men iuſtly ought to be offended. For the old men couetous, and of fleſh vicious, both of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the gods, and ſclaunder the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. O how many I haue known in Rome, who in their youth haue been highly prayſed and: eſteamed and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards through geeuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelf to very much lightnes in theyr age, haue been of all abhorred. And the woorſt of al is, that they haue loſt al their credit, their parents, their fauor, and their poore innocent children theyr profit.

For I ſaw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father die in i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>famy, &amp; his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liue in pouerty, I beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al thoſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſhal hear this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. &amp; al thoſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſhal reade
<pb facs="tcp:21411:225"/>
this wryting, ſhall find the fact of this amorous old man, both vile and filthy, and they will allow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenat which they gaue againſt him for good and iuſt. I ſwere that if <hi>Gaguino Cato</hi> had had as many yong men in his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as hee left old men louers that followed his example in Rome, ther ſhoold not be caſt away ſo many men, neyther ſo many women euyl maried. It chaunceth oft tymes, that when the old men (ſpecially beeyng noble, and valyant) are aduertyſed of theyr ſeruants, are rebuked of their pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yed of their frends, &amp; accuſed of their enemies to bee diſhoneſt in ſuch a place they aunſwer, that they are not in loue, but in ieſt. When I was very yong no leſſe in wiſdome, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in age, one night in the Capitoll I met with a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of mine, the which was ſo old, that hee might haue taken mee for his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiew, to whom I ſayd theſe woords. Lord <hi>Fabricus,</hi> are you alſo in loue? hee aunſwered mee. You ſee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my age ſuffereth mee not that I ſhoold bee a louer if I ſhoold bee, it is but in ſport.</p>
                     <p>Truly I marueiled to meete him at that hour, and I was aſhamed to haue ſuch an anſwer. In old men of great age, and grauitie, ſuch requeſt can not bee called loue, but grief, not paſtime, but loſſe of time, not mockry, but villany: for of loue in ieſt, enſueth infamy in deede. I aſk you <hi>Claude,</hi> and <hi>Claudine,</hi> what a thing is it to ſee an old man to bee in loue? Trulye it is no other, but as a garland before the tauern dores, wher al men think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther is wine, and they ſel nought els but vineger. They are egges white without, and rotten within, they are golden pilles, the taſt wherof are very bitter, and as e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pty box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in ſhops, which haue new writings on them, or as a new gate, and with in the houſe is full of filth and cobwebs: finally the old louer is a knight of Exchetes, which helpeth to loſe mony, and can deliuer no man from peril. Let this woord bee noted, and alwayes in your memory committed, that the old man which is vitious, is but as a leeke which hath the head white, &amp; the tayle green. Mee thinketh that you ought to break the wings of time, ſince that you haue feathers to flye withal. Deceiue not your ſelf nor your frends and neighbours, ſaying that ther is time for all. For the amendment is in your hands, but time is in the hands of god to diſpoſe. Let vs come now to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy this great domage, do what you can by the day of youth, and deferr it not vntil the night of age: for ill cutteth the knife, when the edge therof is dulled, and ill can hee knaw the bones which is accuſtomed to eat the fleſh.

I mean, with the vpright thoughts of accompts, which wee ought to geue to the gods of our life, and to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our renoume.

The gods are ſo gentle to ſerue, and ſo good to content, that if for all the ſeruices wee ow them, and for the gifts which they geeue vs, wee can not pay them in good woorks: they demaund nomore in payment but good willes.

                     <p>THe great <hi>Alexander</hi> king of <hi>Macedony,</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> the vnfortunat king of the <hi>Perſyes,</hi> were not onely contrary in warres and conqueſts, which they made but alſo in the conditions and inclinations which they had. For <hi>Alexander</hi> naturally loued to geeue and ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: and <hi>Darius</hi> to the contrary, to heape, lock, &amp; keepe. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fame of <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſpred abrode through out all the world, to bee a prince of honor, and not couetous, his owne lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him entierly, and ſtraungers deſyred to ſerue him faithfully, The miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable kyng <hi>Darius,</hi> as hee was noted of great auarice and of ſmall liberality, ſo his did diſobey him, and ſtraungers hated him. Whereof may bee gathered that princes and great lords by geeuing, do make them ſelues rich: &amp; in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, they make theym ſelues poore. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his apothegmes declareth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after king <hi>Darius</hi> was, dead &amp; <hi>Alexander</hi> had triumphed ouer al the oriental parts, a man of <hi>Thebes</hi> beinge in the market place of <hi>Athenes</hi> ſetting foorth the fortune of <hi>Alexander,</hi> for the ſundry countreys which hee had conquered: and deſcribing the euel fortune of <hi>Darius,</hi> for the great nomber of men which hee had loſt, a philoſopher with a loude voice ſayd. O man of <hi>Thebes</hi> thou art greatly deceiued, to think that one prince loſeth many ſeignories: and that the other Prince winneth many realmes. For <hi>Alexander</hi> the great wanne nought but ſtones, and couerings of cities: for with his liberality he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redie gotten the good willes of the cite ſins, And to the contrary, the vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat <hi>Darius</hi> did not loſe but ſtones, and the couertures of cities, for with his couetouſnes and auarice he had now loſt al the hartes of thoſe of <hi>Aſia.</hi> And farther this philoſopher ſayd vnto him, that princes which wil enlarge their eſtates, and amplify their realmes in their conqueſts, ought firſt to winne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harts, &amp; to bee noble, and liberal: and afterwards to ſend their armies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the forts, and walls, for otherwiſe litel auayleth it to winne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtones if the hartes do rebell. Wherby a man may gather, that that which <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> wan, hee wan by liberalitye and ſtoutnes: and that which king <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> loſt, he loſt for beeinge miſerable, and couetous. And let vs not meruail hereat, for the princes &amp; great lordes w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> are ouercome with auarice, I doubt whither they euer ſhal ſee theym ſelues co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querors of many realmes. The vice of auarice is ſo deteſtable, ſo euel, ſo odious, &amp; ſo perilous, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhoold e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ploy hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelf to write al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modites theru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to belongi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, my penne ſhould do nought

elles, then to preſume to dry vp all the water in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea: For the ſtomake where auarice entreth, cauſeth a man to ſerue vices, &amp; worſhippe Idolles. If a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man woulde prepare him ſelfe to think on the great trauaile, and litell reſte that this curſed vice beareth with him, I thinke that none would be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious therin. Though the couetous man had no other trauaile, but alwayes to go to bed wyth daunger, and to riſe vp with care: Me thinketh it is a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſufficient for ſuch one when he goeth to bed, thinketh that he ſhould be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his bed, or that ſleping his cofers ſhould be rifled: and from that time he riſeth, he is alwayes tormented with feare to loſe that which he hath wonne, and careful to augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that litel in to much. The deuine <hi>Plato</hi> in the firſt boke of his common welth ſaid theſe wordes, the men be made riche, becauſe they neuer learned to bee riche: for he which continually, and truelye will become riche, firſt ought to abhorre couetouſnes, before hee beginne to occupie hym ſelfe to locke vp goods. For the man which ſetteth no bond to his deſire ſhall alwayes haue litle thoughe he ſee himſelfe lord of the worlde. Truly this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was worthilye ſpoken of ſuch a man. The ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Stoyckes</hi> doth ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfy my mind much, wherof <hi>Ariſtotel</hi> in his pollitikes maketh me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cion, where he ſayth, that vnto great affayres, are alwaies required great riches: &amp; there is no extreame pouerty, but where there hathe beene greate aboundaunce. Therof enſueth, that to princes and great lordes which haue much, they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t much, bicauſe to men which haue had litel, they can not wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but litel. Yf we ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>moniſhe wordlings not to be vitious, they wil alwayes haue excuſes to excuſe theim ſelues, declaring why they haue bene vitious: the vice of auarice excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to whom and with whom they haue no excuſe. For if one vaine reaſon be readye to excuſe then, there are .2000. to condemne them. Let vs put example in all the principall vices, and we ſhall ſe how this onely of auarice, remaineth condemned, and not excuſed. If we reaſon why a prince or great lord is haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and proude, he wil aunſwere that he hath great occaſion. For the natural diſpoſition of men is, rather to deſire to commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with trauaile, then to ſerue with reſt. Yf we reproue any man that is furious, and geuen to anger: he will aunſwere vs, that we maruaile not, ſince we maruaile not of the proude: For the enemy hath no more auctority to trouble any man, then the other to take reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of him. Yf we blame him for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is fleſhly and vitious, he will aunſwer vs, that he can not abſteyne from that ſinne: for if any man can eſchew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> acts he fighteth continually with vncleane thoughtes. Yf we ſay that any man is negligent, he will aunſwere vs, that he deſerueth not to be blamed: for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenes of our nature is ſuche, that if we do trauaile it, immediatly it is weary and if we reſt it, immediatly it reioyceth: Yf we rebuke any man that is a glut<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ton, he wil aunſwer vs, that without eatinge and drinkinge we can not lyue in the worlde: for the deuine worde hath not forbidden man to eate with the mouthe, but the vncleane thoughtes which come from the hart. As of theſe fewe vices we haue declared, ſo maye we excuſe al the reaſidue: but to the vice of couetouſnes, none can geue a reaſonable excuſe. For with money put into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cofer, the ſoule ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not profite, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodye reioyce. <hi>Boetius</hi> in his booke of con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſolation ſayd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> money is good, not when we haue it in poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but when we want it, &amp; in very dede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſentence of <hi>Boetius</hi> is very profound: for when man ſpendeth mony, he attayneth to that he wil, but hauinge it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, it profiteth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21411:226"/>
him nothinge. We may ſay of riche and couetous men, that if they heape and kepe, they ſay it is but for deare and drye yeres, and to releue their parents &amp; frendes. We may aunſwere them, that they do not heape vp to remedye the poore in ſuche like neceſſities, but rather to bringe the commonwealth to gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pouertye. For then they ſel al thinges deare, and put out theyr money to great vſury: ſo that this couetous man dooth more harme with that he dooth lend them, then the dry yere dooth with that it hath taken from theim. The no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble and vertuous men ought not to ceaſe to do wel, for feare of dry yeres: for in the ende if one deare yeare come it maketh all dere, and at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a caſe, he onely may be called happy, which for being free and liberal in almes, ſhall reioyce that his table ſhould be coſtlye. Let couetous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beware, that for keaping of much goodes, they giue not to the deuel their ſoules: for it may be that before the deare yere cometh to ſel their corne, their bodies ſhalbe layd in the graue. O what good dooth god to the noble men, geuing them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral hartes: and what ill luck haue couetous men (hauing as thei haue) their hartes ſo hard laced. For if couetous men did taſt how ſweete and neceſſary a thing it is to giue: they could kepe litle for them ſelues. Nowe ſithens the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and couetous men haue not the hart to giue to their frendes, too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to theire parentes, to ſuccour the poore, to lend to their neighboures, nor to ſuſteyne the orphanes, it is to be thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they wil ſpend it on them ſelues. Truly I ſaye no more, for there are men ſo miſerable, and ſo hard of that they haue, that they thinke that as euyll ſpent, whiche amonge theim ſelues they ſpende: as that which one robbeth from them of their goods. Howe will the couetous and miſerable wretche geue a garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te to a naked man, which dare not make him ſelfe a cote? How wil he geue to eate to the poore famylyar, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> as a poore ſlaue eateth the bread of branne, and ſellethe the floure of meale? How ſhal the pilgrimes lodge in his houſe, who, for pure miſerye dare not en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter? and howe doth he viſite the hoſpitall, and reliue the ſicke, that oft times ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſardeth his owne helth and life, for that he wil not geue one penye to the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition? how ſhall he ſuccour ſecretly the poore and neady, which maketh his owne children go barefoote, and naked? how can he helpe to marye the poore maydes being orphanes, when he ſuffereth his owne daughters to waxe old in his houſe? how wil he geue of his goodes to the poore captiues, which will not paye his owne men their wages? how wil he geue to eate to the children of poore gentelmen, which alwayes grudgeth at that his owne ſpende? howe ſhould we beleue that he wil apparel a widowe, hwich wil not giue his owne wife a hoode? howe doth he dayly giue almes, which goeth not to the churche on the Sonday becauſe he wil not offer one peny? how ſhal the couetous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reioice the hart, ſith for ſpending of one peny, oft times hee goeth ſupperles to bed? And finally I ſaye, that he wil neuer giue vs of his owne proper goodes, which weapeth alwayes for the goodes of an other.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:227"/>ONe of the thinges wherin the deuine prouidence ſheweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do not vnderſtand the maner of her gouerment, is to ſee that ſhe geueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandinge too a man too knowe the riches, ſhe geueth him force too ſeeke theim, ſubtiltye too gather them, vertue too ſuſteyne them, courage too defend them, and alſo longe life to poſſeſſe them. And with al this ſhe gyueth him not licence to enioye them, but rather ſuffereth him, that as withoute rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he hath made him ſelfe lorde of an nother mans, of righte he ſhoulde bee made ſclaue of his owne: thereby a man may knowe, of howe greater excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencye vertuous pouertye is, then the outragious couetouſnes: for ſo much as to the poore, god doth giue contentation of that litell he hath, and from the rich man he taketh contentacion of the great deale he poſſeſſeth. So that to the co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uetous man we ſe troubles encreaſe hourely: and the gaine cometh vnto him but monethly. Let vs compare the riche and couetous man to the pore potter, and we ſhall ſe who ſhall profite moſt, eyther the potter with his pottes that he maketh of earthe, or els the couetous with the mony which he hathe in the earth. Though I make no aunſwere to this, yet anſwere herein hath ben al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redye made, that the one is muche better at eaſe with the earth, then the other is with the good. For the potter getteth his liuing by ſelling pottes, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous man loſeth his ſoule by keping riches. I humblye require y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and alſo I beſech y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great lordes, &amp; further I admoniſhe the other nobles, and Plebeiens, alwayes to haue this worde in memorye, I ſaye, and affirme that the more ſtrongly the man keapeth, and locketh his treaſures: the more ſtrongly, and priuely is he kepte: for if he put two keyes to keape his treaſure he putteth ſeuen to his harte not to ſpende them. Let the noble and valiaunt men beware, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they geue not their myndes to heape vp treaſoures: for if once their hartes be kindled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> couetouſnes, for feare of ſpendinge a halfpeny, they wyll daylye ſuffer them ſelues to fall into a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d miſeries. The Plebeiens w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> are very riche may ſaye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue not heaped vp much treaſures, ſithens they can not behold a hundred, or two hundred duccates. To this I aunſwere that the eſtates conſidered, tenne duccates do aſmuch harme to a treaſurer, as to others tenne thouſand. For the faulte conſiſteth not in keaping, or hidi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g (much or litel) riches: but for ſo much as in keapinge them, we ceaſe to doe ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny good workes. To me it is a ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge matter, that nigardlines hath greater force to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couetous, then conſcience hath in others. For there are many, which notwithſtandynge conſcience, doe profite with the goodes of others: and the couetous hauinge more miſery then conſcience, cannot yet profite with their owne. With much care and no ſmall dilygence the couetous men doe prouyde that the myllers doe not robbe the meale, that their beaſtes make no waſtes that the hunters runne not through the corne, that their wine periſh not, that thoſe which owe them any thing, do not go &amp; make them ſelues bank routes, that wynetts doe not eate their corne, and that theues robbe not their goods: but in the ende they watche none ſo wel, as them ſelues. For al the others (erely, or late) haue alwaies oportunitye to robbe from them ſomewhat: but the couetous hath neuer the herte to chaunge a duccate. Men ought to take great pity of a couetous man, who by his owne wil, &amp; not of neceſſity, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his gowne al to torne, his ſhoes out, his poyntes without aggletes an euill fauored girdle, his cote rente, his hatte olde, hys hoſe ſeame rent, hys

cappe greaſy, and his ſherte lowſy: fynally I ſay, that dyuers of theſe myſers fayne that they haue a great ſumme to pay, and it is for no other thing, but for not wearyng a good garment. What can the couetous doo more, then for keeping a peny in his purſſe, hee will goe two moneths and not trimme his beard? Sithens it is true that theſe pynchpenies doo behaue theire per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnes ſo euyll, doo ye thynk they haue their houſes any thing the better furniſhed? I ſay no, but you ſhall ſee their chambers full of cobwebbes, the doores out of the hingels, the windows riuen, the glaſſes broken, the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches loſe, the couertures of the houſe wythout gutters, the ſtooles broken, the beds woorme eaten, and chimnies ready to fall: ſo that to herber a frend or kinſman of theirs, they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to lodge him in their neighbors houſe, or els to ſend to borrow all that they want. And paſſing ouer the garments they wear, and the houſen wherin they dwel, let vs ſee what table they keep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> for of their gardeins they eat no fruyt, but that that falleth of the tree, of their vines, but rotten grapes, of their ſheepe, the ſickeſt, of their corne, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wetteſt, of wine that which hath taken wind, of lard that is yelow, of milk, that is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and finally I ſay, the felicity that glottons haue in eating, the ſelf ſame haue they in keeping. O vnhappy are the glottons, and much more are the couetous: for the taſt of one conſiſteth only in the throte, and the felicity of the other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth in that hee may lock vp in his cheſt. Wee haue now ſeen how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couetous were ſymple apparayl, keepe a poore table, and dwell in a filthy houſe: and yet they leſſe regard thoſe things that touch theyr honor.</p>
                     <p>For if they had their eares as open to heere, as they haue their harts bent at ech hour to gather, and heap vp: they ſhould hear how they are called my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, vſerers, nygards, pinchepenies, oppreſſors, cruell, vnthankfull, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunat. Fynally I ſay, that in the commonwealth they are ſo hated, that all men had rather lay hands vppon their bodyes to kill them, then tongues on their renowm to defame them. The couetous man is of all other moſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky. For if wee fall at ſtrief with any, hee ſhall fynd no one frend that wyll come to viſit him in his houſe: but hee ſhall haue a hundred theeues whych will robbe him of his goods. For to reuenge a couetous enemy, a man neede deſire nought els but that hee liue long: for hee is more tormented in his life with his own couetouſnes, then hee can bee otherwiſe with any penaunce. If rych men woold ſay vnto mee, that they do not reioice to haue fair houſes, ſithens they may haue them, neither of curious aparel, ſince they may were it, nor of deinty meats, ſithens they may eat them, and that that which they doo, is not to bee couetous, but for that they are good chriſtians: In ſo iuſt a thing, reaſon woold my pen ſhoold ceaſe: but I am ſory, they ſo lyttle eſteeme things touching their honor, and much leſſe the matters touching their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auaricious ſay hee keepeth goods to doo almes, I doo not beleue it: for daily wee ſee that if a poore man aſk him almes, hee anſwereth them immediatly, god help you, for hee hath neither purſe nor peny. The couetous vſeth this, that hee neuer geeueth any almes in his houſe, but fatt meat, and reſty baken, rotten cheeſe, and hore bread: ſo that it ſeemeth rather that they make clean their houſe, then geeue almes to the poore. If the couetous man woold tel vs, that that which they haue, is to diſcharge ſome dets of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors wherwith they are burdened, I ſay it is a vain excuſe: ſithens
<pb facs="tcp:21411:228"/>
wee ſee that the willes of their fathers, of their mothers, &amp; of their graund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, bee not as yet performed, neyther will they think to performe them, which ſeemeth to bee very true. For ſince the hour that they layd their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the graue, they neuer had any one thought of their dead fathers. Hee which of pure couetouſnes and miſery, ſuffreth him ſelf to dye for hunger and cold: I think hee hath ſmall deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to geeue almes, and much leſſe to doo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man good. If the couetous man ſay vnto vs, that that which hee keepeth, is for no other cauſe but to buyld a ſumptuous chappell, and to leaue of them ſome memory, to this I aunſwer. That if ſuch one doth it with his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſwet, and maketh reſtitucion of all the euill that hee hath doon, it ſhalbee ſanctified, &amp; of all good men commended: but if the couetous will that many liue in great pouerty, only to make a rich tomb, god doth not commaund that, neither doth the church admit it: for ſacrifice done to god with the cryes and ſwet of others, is not acceptable. If the couetous tell vs, that though they heap treaſures, it is not but at their death to diſtribute it to the poore, and to bee brought honeſtly to the ground: I ſay that I commend this purpoſe, ſo his intent bee accordingly performed: but I am ſory y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couetouſe man ſhoold think hereby to merit, and that hee ſhoold thus diſcharge the wickednes of his lyfe, for the diſtribution of a lytle mony after his death.</p>
                     <p>I woold think it more ſure, that princes and great lords ſhoold ſpend their goods, to mary poore maydens, beeing orphans in their lyfe, then to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund money to bee dealt after their death. For oft tymes the heirs or their executors, the body interred, doo little performe the will of the teſtator: and much leſſe obſerue the legacyes beequethed, though it bee to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vtter vndoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the poore orphans.

                        <hi>MArck</hi> the Emperor, with his brother <hi>Annius Verus,</hi> fellow in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, wiſheth to thee <hi>Cincinatus</hi> of <hi>Capua,</hi> health to thy perſon, and grace againſt thy euill fortune. From the feaſt of our mother <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthe,</hi> I haue ſeene neither ſeruaunt of thy houſe, nor read any letter of thy hand, which thing maketh mee ſuſpect greatly, that thy health is in daunger, or that thou miſtruſteſt our frendſhip: for earneſt frendſhip, requireth dayly communication, or viſitation: I pray thee bee not ſo careles from henceforth, and doo not forget vs in ſuch wiſe, I mean, that thou wilt come and ſee vs, or at the leaſt that thou wilt write vnto vs often: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> letters of faithful frends, though vtterly they doo not take from vs the deſire of the preſence: yet at the leaſt they make vs hope for a meeting. I know that thou maiſt anſwer mee, that in the common wealth of <hi>Capua</hi> thou art ſo buſyed, that it is impoſſible thou ſhooldſt write vnto mee: heereto I anſwer thee: That in no affaires thou canſt bee ſo occupied, that it bee a lawful let, not to communicat, or write vnto thy frend. For wee may wel call the tyme which wee liue, to bee wel em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, which is ſpent in the ſeruice of god, and in the conuerſation of our frends. All the reſidue that wee waſt in talking, traueling, ſleeping, eating and reſting, wee ought not to write it in the booke of lyfe, but in the regiſter of death. For al bee it that in ſuch ſemblable woorks the body is refreſhed: yet therwith the heart cannot bee comforted. I ſwere vnto thee therfore (my frend) that it is impoſſible y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man take any contentation of any worldly thing, where the hart is not at reſt: for our comfort is not in the ſinnues, or in the bones of the body, but in the liuely power of the ſoul. It is long ſithens that you and I haue knowen togethers, it is long time likewiſe that I loued thee, and thou mee: and ſith wee are ſo true old frends, it is but reaſon that with good woorks wee doo renew our frendſhip. For falſly they vſurp the name of frendſhip, which are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant one wyth the other, no more then if they were ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers. The man w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſpeaketh not to mee, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> wryteth not to mee, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſeeth mee not, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> viſiteth mee not, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> geeueth mee not, &amp; to whom I geeue not, I woold not hee were my enemy: but it litle auaileth mee that hee call mee frend, for perticuler frendſhip conſiſteth not in aboundance, but that frends doo open their harts, and talk with their perſons. Peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture thou wilt ſay, that the great diſtaunce which is from Rome to that countrey, hath beene occaſion to deminiſh our frendſhip: for the noble harts are on fier with the preſence of that they loue, and haue great paine with the abſence of that they deſire. I aunſwer, that the farder the delicious wines are ſent, from the place where they grow: the greater ſtrength they haue. I mean, that heerein true frends are knowen, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their perſons are furtheſt ſeuered: for then are their willes moſt conioined. Tell mee I pray thee <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> ſithens al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thou haſt found mee a diligent frend in thy ſeruice, why dooſt thou mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt my faithfull good will? The greene leaues outwardly doo ſhew, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tree inwardly is not dry. I mean, that the good woorks outwardly do declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feruentnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart inwardly. If thou <hi>Cincinnatus</hi> preſumeſt to bee a true frend of thy frend, I will thou know this rule of frendſhip, which is: Where perfect loue is not, there wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth alway faithful ſeruice: &amp; for the contrary hee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfectly loueth, aſſuredly ſhalbee ſerued.

                     <p>IN tymes paſt I beeing yong, and thou old, I did ſuccor thee with money, and thou mee with good counſell: but now the world is otherwiſe chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in that thy white hears doo iudge thee to bee old, and thy woorks doo cauſe thee to bee yong. Therefore neceſſity compelleth mee, that wee cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge our ſtile, which is: that I ſuccor thee with good counſell, though thou geeue mee no money therfore: for I count thy couetouſnes to bee ſuch, that for all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good counſel, &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelers of Rome, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wilt not vouchſafe to geeue one quatrine of <hi>Capua.</hi> Now for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good that I wiſh thee, &amp; for that which I owe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of frendſhip, I will preſently geeue thee a counſel, wherby thou mayſt know what a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to doo, to bee loued of god, &amp; feared &amp; loued of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wilt quietly lead thy life in this miſerable world, retain this well in memory which I write vnto thee. Firſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good deedes thou haſt receiued of any, thoſe ſhalt thou remember: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrongs thou haſt ſuſtained, them ſhalt thou forget. Secondarely, eſteeme much thy own little: &amp; way not the much of an other.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the company of the good always couet: &amp; the conuerſation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euill dayly fly. Fourthly, to the great ſhew thy ſelf graue: &amp; to the ſmall more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant. Fiftly, to thoſe which are preſent, doo always good woorks: and of thoſe that bee abſent, always ſpeak good woords. Sixtly, way little y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſſe of fortune, &amp; eſteeme much things of honor. The ſeuenth, to win one thing, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aduenture thou many: nor for many things doubtfull, doo not thou adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any one thing certain. Finally &amp; laſtly, I pray thee &amp; aduertiſe thee that thou haue no enemy: &amp; that thou keepe but one frend. Hee which among the good wilbee counted for good, none of theſe things hee ought to want. I know well that thou wilt haue great pleaſure to ſee theſe my counſels well writen: But I enſure thee I ſhal haue greater pleaſure, to ſee them in thy deedes well obſerued. For by writing to geeue good counſel, it is eaſy: but by woorks to folow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, is maruelous hard. My faithful frendſhip to thee plighted, &amp; thy great ability conſidered, cauſed mee always for thee in Rome to procure honorable offices, &amp; by my ſuyt thou haſt been Edite &amp; tribune, &amp; maiſter of the horſes, wherin thou behauedſt thy ſelf w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuch wiſdom, that all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenate therfore yelded mee moſt harty thanks, I procuring them for thee, &amp; thou for thy ſelf winning ſuch perpetual renowm. One thing of thee I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, which with good wil I woold not haue knowen, &amp; much leſſe that any ſuch thing by thee ſhoold haue been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted: that is to weet, that thou leauing thy office of the pretorſhip in the warre by land, haſt taken vpon thee traffike of a marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by ſea: ſo that thoſe which in Rome knew thee a knight doo ſee thee now in <hi>Capua</hi> a marchant. My pen indyting this my letter, for a tyme ſtood in ſuſpence, for no other cauſe, but only to ſee what thing in thee firſt I might beſt blame: either y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble office which thou didſt forſake, or the vyle &amp; baſe eſtate w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> thou haſt choſen. And though thou bee ſo much bereued of thy ſences, yet call to mynd thy auncient predeceſſors which dyed in the warres, only to leaue their children, and nephews armed knights: and that thou preſently ſeekeſt to loſe that liberty through thy couetouſnes, which thei wanne by their valyauntnes. I think I am not deceiued, that if thy prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:21411:229"/>
were reuiued, as they were ambicious of honor, ſo woold they bee greedy to eat thee in morſels, ſinnues, bones and all. For the children which vniuſtly take honor from their fathers, of reaſon ought to loſe their lyues.</p>
                     <p>The caſtels, towns, houſen, mountains, woods, beaſts, Iewels, and ſiluer, which our predeceſſors haue left vs, in the end by long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance doo periſh: and that which cauſeth vs to haue perpetuall memory of them, is the good renowm of their lyfe. And therfore if this bee true, it is great ſhame for the parents to haue ſuch children, in whom the renowm of their predeceſſors dooth end. In the floriſhing time of <hi>Cicero</hi> the oratour, when by his counſell the whole common wealth was gouerned, hee beeing then of power, both in knowledge and of money: <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſaid vnto him in his <hi>inuectiue,</hi> that hee was of baſe ſtock: wherunto hee aunſwered. Great cauſe haue I too render tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks vnto the gods, that I am not as thou art, by whom thy high linage is ended: but my poore ſtock by me doth now begin too riſe. It is great pity to ſee, how many good, noble, &amp; valiant men are dead: but it is more greef to ſee preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their children vitious, and vnthrifts. So that there remaineth aſmuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of their infamy, as there doth of the others honeſty. Thou makſt mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, that thou haſt forſaken to conquer the enemies as a romain knight, and that thou art become a marchant, as a poore plebeian. Thou makeſt mee to muſe a littel, my freend <hi>Cincinnatus</hi> that thou wilt harme thy familiars, and ſuffer ſtraungers to liue in peace. Thou ſeekeſt to procure death, to thoſe which geeue vs life: and to deliuer from death thoſe, which take our life To rebels thou geeueſt reſt, &amp; to the peace makers thou geeueſt anoyaunce. To thoſe which take from vs our own thou wilt geeue: and to thoſe which geeueth vs of theirs thou wilt take. Thou condemneſt the innocent, and the condemned thou wilt deliuer. A defender of thy countrey thou wilt not bee, but a tirant of thy common welth. To al theſe things aduentureth hee which leaueth weapons, and fauleth to marchandiſe. With my ſelf oft times I haue muſed, what occaſion ſhould moue thee to forſake chiualry, wherein thou hadſt ſuch honor: and to take in hand marchandiſe, whereof foloweth ſuch infamy. I ſay, that it is aſmuch ſhame for thee to haue gon from the warres as it is honor for thoſe which are born vnto office in the common welth. My freend <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> my end tendeth not to condemne marchandiſe nor mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunds, nor to ſpeak euill of thoſe which traffick, by the trade of bying and ſelling. For as without the valiant knights, warre cannot bee atchyued: ſo likewiſe without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diligent marchants, the comon wealth cannot bee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. I cannot imagin for what other cauſe thou ſhooldſt forſake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warre, &amp; traffique marchandiſe, vnleſſe it were, becauſe thou now being old, &amp; wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt force to aſſault men openly in the ſtraits: ſhooldſt with more eaſe ſitting in thy chayer robbe ſecretly in the market place. O poore <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> ſithens thou byeſt cheap &amp; ſelleſt deare, promiſeſt much &amp; performeſt litle: thou byeſt by one meaſure &amp; ſelleſt by an other, thou watcheſt that none deceiue thee, &amp; playeſt therin as other marchants accuſtom. And to conclude I ſwear, that the meaſure wherwith the gods ſhall meaſure thy lyfe, ſhalbee much iuſter then that of thy merits. Thou haſt taken on thee an office, wherwith, that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paignions in many days haue robbed, thou in one hour by diſceit dooſt get, &amp; afterwards the time ſhal come, when all the goods w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> thou haſt gotten,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:230"/>
both by trueth, &amp; falſhod, ſhalbe loſt, not only in an hour which is long: but in a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which is but ſhort. Whether wee geeue much, wee haue much, wee may doo much, or wee liue much: yet in the end the gods are ſo iuſt, that all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euill wee doo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſhalbee puniſhed, &amp; for all the good wee woork, wee ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee rewarded, ſo that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods oftentimes permit, that one alone ſhall ſcourge many, and afterward the long time puniſheth all.</p>

                     <p>IF I knew thy wiſdom eſteemed the world, &amp; vanities therof, ſo much as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world doth poſſeſſe thee, and thy days, as by thy white hears moſt many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly doth appeere: I neede not take the payns to perſwade thee, nor thou ſhooldſt bee annoied in hearing mee: Notwithſtanding thou beeing at the gate of great care, reaſon woold that ſome ſhoold take the clapper to knock therat, with ſome good counſell: for though the raſer bee ſharp, it needeth ſometimes to bee whet. I mean though mans vnderſtanding bee neuer ſo cleere: yet from time to time it needeth counſel. Vertuous men oft times do erre, not becauſe they woold fail, but for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs are ſo euil of digeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the vertu they haue, ſuffiſeth not to tell them what thing is neceſſary for their profit. For the which cauſe it is neceſſary, that his will bee brydled, his wit fyned, his oppinion changed, his memory ſharpned, &amp; aboue all, now and then that hee forſake his own aduiſe, and cleaue vnto the counſell of an other. Men which couet to make high, ſumptuous, fair, and large buildings, haue grete care that the foundacion therof be ſurely layd: for where the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacions are not ſure, there the whole buyldings are in great daunger. The maners and conditions of this world (that is to weete) the proſperous eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes whervpon the children of vanity are ſet, are founded of quick ſand: in that ſort, that bee they neuer ſo valyaunt, proſperous, and mighty, a litle blaſt of wynd dooth ſtirre them, a little heat of proſperity doth open them, a ſhowre of aduerſity doth wet them, and vnwares death ſtriketh them all flatt to the ground. Men ſeeing they cannot bee perpetuall, doo procure to continue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, in raiſing vp proud buyldings, and leauing to their children great eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates: wherin I count them fooles, no leſſe then in things ſuperfluous. For admit the pillers bee of gold, the beams of ſiluer, and that thoſe which ioyn them bee kings, and thoſe which buyld them are noble, and in that mining they conſume a thouſand yeres beefore they can haue it out of the ground, or that they can come to the bottoms: I ſwere vnto them, that they ſhall fynd no ſtedy rock, nor lyuely mountain, wher they may buyld their houſe ſure, nor to cauſe their memory to bee perpetuall. The immortall gods haue participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things to the mortall men, immortality only reſerued: and therfore they are called immortall, for ſo much as they neuer dye, and wee others are called mortall, bycauſe dayly wee vaniſh away. O my frend <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> men haue an end, and thou thinkeſt that gods neuer ought to end. Now greene, now rype, now rotten, fruit is ſeuered from this lyfe, from the tree of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable fleſh, &amp; eſteem this as nothing, forſomuch as death is naturall. But oft times in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaf or flower of youth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> froſt of ſome diſeaſe, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> peril of ſome

It is a tedious &amp; long woork to weue a cloth: yet when in many days it is wouen, in one moment it is cut. I mean that it is much folly to ſee a man w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what toil hee enricheth him ſelf, &amp; into what perill hee putteth him ſelf, to win a ſtate of honor: &amp; afterwards whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee think litle wee ſee him periſh in his eſtate, leauing of him no memory.

Finally I ſay, that when wee ſleepe moſt ſure, hee waketh vs with greateſt perill. Eyther thou knowſt the world with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyt, or not: if thou knoweſt him not, why dooſt thou ſerue him? if thou dooſt know him, why dooſt thou follow him?

I retorn to aduiſe thee, to read &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider this woord which I haue ſpoken, for it is a ſentence of profound miſtery. Dooſt thou think <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> that rych men haue litle care to get great riches? I let thee weet, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goods of thys world are of ſuch condicion, that beefore the poore man dooth lock vp in hys cheſts a .100. crowns: hee feeleth a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d greefes &amp; cares in his heart. Our predeceſſors haue ſeen it, wee ſee it preſently, &amp; our ſucceſſors ſhal ſee it: that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> money w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> wee haue gotten, is in a certein nomber, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cares &amp; trauails w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> it bringeth are infinit. Wee haue few paynted houſes, &amp; few noble eſtats in Rome, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in a litle time haue not great cares i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their harts, cruel enmities w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their neighbors, much euil wil of their heirs, diſordinat importunities of their frends, perilous malices of their enemies, &amp; aboue al in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate they haue innumerable proces, &amp; oft times to lock a litle good in their cheſts, they make ten thouſand blots in their honor. O how many haue I known in Rome, to whom it hath chaunced, that all that they haue gotten in Rome to leaue vnto their beſt beeloued child: an other heir (with litle care) of whom they thought not, hath enioyed it. Ther can bee nothing more iuſt, then that al thoſe which haue beegyled others with diſceits in their life, ſhoold bee found diſceiued in their vayn immaginacions after their death. Iniurious ſhoold the gods bee, if in all the euil that the euill propound to doo, they ſhoold geeue them tyme &amp; place conuenient to accompliſh the ſame. But the gods are ſo iuſt and wyſe, that they diſſemble wyth the euill, to thend they ſhoold beegin, and folow the
<pb facs="tcp:21411:231"/>
things according to their own willes and fantaſies: and afterwards at the beſt time, they cut of their lyues, to leaue them in greter torment. The gods ſhoold bee very cruell, and to them it ſhoold bee great greefe to ſuffer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that which the euill haue gathered, to the preiudice of many good: they ſhoold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy in peace for many yeres. Mee thinketh it is great folly, to know that wee are borne weeping, and to ſee that wee dyſighing, and yet for all this that wee dare liue laughing. I woold aſk the world and his worldlyngs, ſithens that wee enter into the world weeping, and go out of the world ſighing, why wee ſhoold lyue laughing? for the rule to meaſure all parts, ought to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall. O <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> who hath beegyled thee, to the end that for one bottel of water of the Sea of this world for thy pleaſure, thou wilt bliſter thy hand with the rope of cares, and brooſe thy body in thanker of troubles: and aboue all to aduenture thyne own honor, for a glaſſe of water of an other man.</p>
                     <p>By the faith of a good man I ſwere vnto thee, that for all the great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of water thou draweſt, for the great deal of money thou haſt, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineſt aſmuch dead for thriſt, drinking of that water: as when thou were without water in the cup. Conſider now thy yeres, if my counſel thou wilt accept, thou ſhalt demaund death of the gods to reſt thee as a vertuous man: and not riches to lyue as a foole. With the teares of my eyes I haue beeway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many in Rome, when I ſaw them depart out of this world, and thee I haue beewayled, and doo beewaile (my frend <hi>Cincinnatus</hi>) with drops of blood, to ſee thee retorn into the world. The credit thou hadſt in the ſenate, the blood of thy predeceſſors, my frenſhip, the aucthority of thy parſon, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of thy parentage, the ſclaunder of thy comonwealth, ought to withdraw thee from ſo great couetouſnes. O poore <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> conſider the white ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored hears which doo fall, ought to bee occupied in the noble armies: ſithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s thou art noble of blood, valyant in parſon, auncient of yeres, and not euil wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the common wealth. For thou oughteſt to conſider, that more woorth is reaſon, for the path way of men whych are good: then the common opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the large high way of the euyll. For if it bee narrow to go on the one ſide, ther is no duſt wherwith the eyes bee blynded as in the other.</p>
                     <p>I will geeue thee a counſell, and if thou feeleſt thy ſelf euel, neuer count thou mee for frend. Luſt no more after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greaſy fatt of temporall goods, ſins thou haſt ſhort lyfe: for wee ſee dayly many, beefore they come to thy age dye, but wee ſee few after thy age lyue. After this counſell I will geeue thee an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, that thou neuer truſt preſent proſperitie: for then alway thou art in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſome euill fortune. If thou art mounted into ſuch pricking thorns as a foole: mee thinketh thou oughts to deſcend as a ſage. And in this ſort all wil ſay amongſt the people, that <hi>Cincinnatus</hi> is deſcended, but not fallen. My letter I will conclude, and the concluſion therof ſee well thou note, that is to weete, that thou and thy trade ſhalbee curſed, wher you other marchants wil liue poore, to dy rich.

                        <hi>PIſiſtratus</hi> the renowmed tyraunt among the <hi>Atheniens,</hi> ſins his frends coold not endure the cruelties that hee committed, eche one retorned to his own houſe, and vtterly forſook him. The which when the tyraunt ſaw, hee layd all his treaſure and garments on a heap togethers, and went to viſite his frends, to whom with bitter tears hee ſpake theſe woords. All my apparell and money heere I bring you, with determination, that if you will vſe my company, wee will go all to my houſe, and if you will not come into my company, I am determined to dwell in yours. For if you bee weary to folow mee, I haue great deſire to ſerue you: ſithens you know that they cannot bee called faithfull frends, where the one cannot bear with the other. <hi>Plutarchꝰ</hi> in his <hi>Apothegmes</hi> ſaith, that this tyrant <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> was very rych, and extream couetous, ſo that they write of him, that the gold &amp; ſiluer which once came into his poſſeſſion, neuer man ſaw it afterward, but if hee had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to buy any thing, if they woold not preſent it vnto him willingly, hee woold haue it by force. When hee was dead, the <hi>Atheniens</hi> determined to wey him and his treaſure: the caſe was meruelous, that the gold and ſiluer hee had, weyd more then his dead body .6. tymes. At that tyme in <hi>Athens</hi> there was a philoſopher called <hi>Lido,</hi> of whom the <hi>Atheniens</hi> demaunded, what they ſhoold doo with the treaſure and dead body? mee thinketh (quod thys philoſopher) that if thoſe which are lyuing, did know any ſiluer or gold which the tyraunt tooke from them, it ſhoold bee reſtored again immediatly: and doo not meruell, that I doo not require it to bee put in the common treaſure. For god will not permit, that the commonwealth bee enriched with the theft of Tyraunts: but with the ſwet of the inhabitants. If any goods remayn which doo not appere from whom they haue beene taken, mee thinketh that they ought to bee diſtributed among the poore, for nothing can bee more iuſt, then that which the goods wherewyth the tyraunt hath enpoueriſhed many, wyth the ſelf ſame wee ſhoold enrich ſome.</p>

to bee eaten, and to the dogs to bee gnawen. And let no man thynk this ſentence to bee cruell: for wee are bound to doo no more for him at his death, then hee did for him ſelf in his lyfe, who beeing ſo ouercome with auaryce, that hee woold neuer diſburſe ſo much money, as ſhoold buy him ſeuen foote of earth, wherin his graue ſhoold bee made. And I will you know, that the gods haue doon a great good to all <hi>Greece,</hi> to take lyfe from this tyrant. Firſt it is good, becauſe much goods are diſperſed, which heeretofore lay hid, and ſerued to no purpoſe. Secondly, that many tongues ſhall reſt, for the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of this tirant, made great want in the common welth, and our tongues the greateſt part of the day were occupied, to ſpeak euill of his parſon. Mee thinketh this philoſopher hath touched two things, which the couetous man dooth in the common wealth, that is to wete, that drawing much gold &amp; ſiluer to the hid treaſure, hee robbeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marchandiſe wherwith the people doo liue: The other dommage is, that as hee is hated of all, ſo hee cauſeth rancour &amp; malice in the harts of all: for hee maketh the rych to murmour, and the poore to blaſphem. One thing I read in the laws of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Lombards</hi> woorthy (of truth) to bee noted and knowen, and no leſſe to bee folowed, which is: that all thoſe which ſhoold haue gold, ſiluer, money, ſilks, &amp; clothes, euery yere they ſhoold bee regiſtred in the place of iuſtice. And this was to the end, not to conſent nor permit them to heap much: but that they ſhoold haue to buy, to ſell, and to trafik, wherby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goods were occupyed among the people. So that hee which did ſpend the money to the profit of his houſe, it was taken for good of the common wealth. Yf chriſtians woold doo that now adays which the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardes</hi> did, there ſhoold not bee ſo many treaſures hid, nor ſo many couetous men in the commonwealth: for nothing can bee more vniuſt, then that one rych man ſhoold heap vp that, which woold ſuffiſe ten thouſand to liue wyth all. Wee can not deny but that the curſed auarice, and diſordinat couetiſe to al ſtates of men is as preiudiciall, as the moth which eateth all garments.</p>
                     <p>Therfore ſpeaking the truth and wyth lyberty, ther is no houſe that it dooth not defyle: for it is more perilous to haue a clod of earth fall into a mans eye, then a beam vppon his foot. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> the renowmed king of the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> beeing aſked of a man of <hi>Thebes</hi> what woord was moſt odible to bee ſpoken to a king, and what woord that was that coold honor him moſt? hee aunſwered. The prince with nothing ſo much ought to bee annoied, as to ſay vnto him that hee is rich, and of nothing hee ought ſo much to reioice, as to bee called poore. For the glory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good prince conſiſteth not in that hee hath great treaſures: but in that hee hath geeuen great recompences. Thys woord without doubt, of all the world was one of the moſt royalleſt, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt to bee committed vnto memory. <hi>Alexander, Pirrhus, Nicanor, Ptolomeꝰ, Pompeius, Iulius Ceſar, Scipio, Hanniball, Marcus Portius, Auguſtus, Cato, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian, Theodoſe, Marcus Aurelius,</hi> all theſe princes haue beene very valiant and vertuous: but addyng heereunto alſo, the writers which haue write<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deedes that they did in their lyues, haue mencioned alſo the pouerty which they had at their death. So that they are no leſſe exalted, for the riches they haue ſpent: then for the proweſſes they haue done. Admit that men of meane ſtate bee auaricious, and princes and great lords alſo couetous: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault of the one is not equall with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vice of the other, though in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end all are culpable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="48" facs="tcp:21411:232"/>For if the poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> keepe, it is for that hee woold not want, but if the knight hoord, it is beecauſe he hath to much. And in this caſe I woold ſay, that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bee the knight which trauaileth, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end that goods abound, and dooth not care that betweene two bowes his renowmſall to the ground. Sithens princes and great lords will that men doo count them noble, vertuous, &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyaunt, I woold know what occaſion they haue to bee nigards and hard.</p>
                     <p>Yf they ſay that that which they keepe is to eat, heerein there is no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for in the end, where the rich eateth leaſt at his table, ther are many that had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue that which remaineth, then that which they prouide to eat in their houſes. If they ſay that that which they keepe is to apparel them, heere in alſo they haue as lytle reaſon: for the greatnes of lords conſiſteth not, in that they ſhoold bee ſumptuouſly appareled, but that they prouide that their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts go not rent, nor torne. If they ſay it is to haue in their chambers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious iewels, in their halles rich Tapeſtry, as little woold I admit this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: for all thoſe which enter into princes palaces, doo beehold more if thoſe that haunt their chambers bee vertuous, then that the tapeſtries bee rych.</p>
                     <p>If they ſay that it is to compaſſe their cities with walles, or to make fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on their fronters: ſo lykewiſe is this aunſwer amongſt the others very cold. For good princes ought not to trauel but to bee well willed, and if in their realms they bee welbeeloued, in the world they can haue no walles ſo ſtrong as the harts of their ſubiects. If they tell vs that that they keepe is to mary their children, as little reaſon is that: for ſithens princes and great lords haue great inheritaunces, they neede not heap much. For if their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren bee good, they ſhall encreaſe that ſhalbee left them: and if by miſhap they bee euill, they ſhall aſwell loſe that that ſhalbee geeuen them. If they ſay vnto vs that that which they heap is for the warres in like maner, that is no iuſt excuſe: For if ſuch warre bee not iuſt, the prince ought not to take it in hand, nor the people therunto to condeſcend: but if it bee iuſt, the common wealth then, &amp; not the prince ſhal bere the charges therof. For in iuſt warres it is not ſufficient that they geeue the prince all their goods: but alſo they muſt them ſelues in parſon hazard their lyues. If they tell vs that that they keepe is to geeue and diſpoſe for their ſoules, at their dying day: I ſay it is not only want of wiſdome, but extream folly. For at the hour of death, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought more to reioyce for that they haue geeuen: then for that at that time hee geeueth. O how princes and great lords are euyll counſailed, ſince they ſuffer them ſelues to bee ſlaundered for beeing couetous, only to heap a lyttle curſed treaſure. For experience teacheth vs, no man can bee couetous of goods, but needs hee muſt bee prodigal of honor, and abandon liberty. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarche</hi> in the booke which hee made of the fortune of <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſayth that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had a priuat ſeruaunt called <hi>Perdyca,</hi> the which ſeeyng that <hi>Alexander</hi> liberally gaue all that which by great trauel hee attayned, on a day hee ſaid vnto him. Tell mee, moſt noble prince, ſithens thou geeueſt all that thou haſt to others, what wilt thou haue for thy ſelf? <hi>Alexander</hi> aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The glory remaineth vnto mee, of that I haue wonne &amp; gotten: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hope of that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I wil geeue &amp; winne. And further he ſaid vnto him, I wil tel thee true <hi>Perdyca:</hi> If I knew that men thought, that all that which I take were for couetouſnes, I ſwere vnto thee by the god <hi>Mars</hi> that I woold not beat
<pb facs="tcp:21411:233"/>
down one corner in a town: and to winne all the world I woold not go one days iourney. My intention is to take the glory to my ſelf, and to deuyde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goods amongſt others. Theſe woords ſo high, were woorthy of a valyant and vertuous prince, as of <hi>Alexander</hi> which ſpake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If that which I haue read in books do not begyle mee, &amp; that which with theſe eies I haue ſeene: to become rych, it is neceſſary that a man geeue: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes and great lords which naturally are geeuen to bee liberall, are alwaies fortunat to haue. It chaunceth oft tymes, that ſome man geeuing a little, is counted liberall: &amp; an other geeuing much, is counted a nigard. The which proceedeth of this that they know not, that liberality &amp; nigardnes conſiſteth not in geeuing much, or lytle: but to know well how to geeue. For the rewards and recompences, which out of tyme are diſtributed, do nother profit them which receiue them, neither agree to him which geeueth them. A couetous man geeueth more at one tyme, then a noble and free hart doth in .20. thus ſaieth the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerb, it is good comming to a niggards feaſt. The difference beetwene the liberality of the one, and the myſery of thother is, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble and vertuous doth geeue that hee geeueth to many: but the nigard geeueth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee geeueth to one onely. Of the which vnaduiſement princes ought greatly to beware. For if in ſuch caſe one man alone ſhoold bee found, which woold comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d his liberality: there are ten thouſand which woold condemne his couetouſnes.</p>
                     <p>It happeneth oft times to princes and great lords, that in deed they are free to recompence, but in geeuing they are very vnfortunat. And the cauſe is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they geeue it not to vertuous perſons and well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicioned, but to thoſe which are vnthankfull, and do not acknowledge the benefit receyued. So that in geeuing to ſome, they haue not made them their frends: and in not geeuing to others, they haue made them their enemies. It ſuffyſeth not to princes &amp; great lords, to haue great deſire to geeue: but to know when, how, or where, &amp; to whom they ought to geeue. For if they bee accuſed otherwiſe to heap vp treaſures, they ought alſo to bee condemned for that they do geeue. When a man hath loſt all that hee hath in play, in whoors, in bankets, and other ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blable vyces, it is but reaſon they bee aſhamed: but when they haue ſpent it like noble, ſtout and liberal men, they ought not to bee diſcontented, for the wiſe man ought to take no diſpleſure for that hee loſeth: but for that hee euil ſpendeth: and hee ought to take no pleaſure for that hee geeueth, but for that hee geeueth not well. <hi>Dion</hi> the grecian in the lyfe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor <hi>Seuerus</hi> ſaith, that one day in the feaſt of the God <hi>Ianus,</hi> when hee had geeuen dyuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and ſundry gifts, as well to his own ſeruaunts, as to ſtrangers, and that hee was greatly commended of all the Romains, hee ſaid vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Do you think now (Romains) that I am very glad for the gifts, rewards, and recompenſes which I haue beſtowed: and that I am very glorious for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praiſes you haue geeuen mee? by the god <hi>Mars</hi> I ſwere vnto ye, and let the god <hi>Ianus</hi> bee ſo mercifull vnto vs all this yere, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pleaſure I haue is not ſo great, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I haue geeuen: as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grief is for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue no more to geeue.</p>

And truly in this caſe hee ſhewed him ſelf to bee welbeeloued of his. For ſpeaking according to the trueth a prynce on who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe lyfe dependeth the hole ſtate of the common wealth, ought to credit few was the table, and allſo fewer in the bed. Another thing this <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> did, whych was, when hee inuited his frends to dinner or ſupper, or other ſtraungers, of ſoome hee deſired to borow ſtooles, of thothers napkins, &amp; of others cups, and ſo of other things, for hee was a prodygall prince. For all that his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts in the morning had bought, beefore the night folowing hee gaue it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. One day al the nobles of his realm of <hi>Egipt</hi> aſſembled togethers, and deſired him very earneſtly, that hee woold be more moderat in geeuing: for they ſaid, through his prodygality, the hole realm was impoueriſhed. The king aunſwered. You others of <hi>Egipt</hi> are marueylouſly deceiued, to think that the poore and needy prince is troubled. In this caſe I dare ſay vnto you, that the poore and needy prince ought to think him ſelf happy, for good princes ought more to ſeeke to enrich others, then to heap vp treaſures for them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. O happy is the common wealth whych deſerueth to haue ſuch a prince, and happy is that tongue, which coold pronounce ſuch a ſentence. Certainly this prince to all princes gaue good example and counſel, that is to weete, that for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was more honor, and alſo more profit, to make others rich: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee rich them ſelues. For if they haue much, they ſhal want no crauers, and if they haue lytle, they ſhal neuer want ſeruaunts to ſerue them. <hi>Suetonius Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> in the booke of <hi>Ceſars</hi> ſayeth, that <hi>Titus</hi> the Emperour one night after ſupper, from the bottom of his hart fetched a heauy ſigh, and hee beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of thoſe which were at his table why hee ſighed ſo ſore, hee aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Wee haue loſt at this day, my frends. By the which woords the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ment, that hee counted not that day amongſt thoſe of lyfe: wherein hee had geeuen no reward nor gyft. Truely this noble prince was valyaunt, and myghty, ſince hee ſighed and had diſpleaſure, not for that which in many days hee had geeuen: but beecauſe that one day hee had failed to geeue any thyng. <hi>Pelopa</hi> of <hi>Thebes,</hi> was a man in his time, very valiaunt and allſo rich: &amp; ſith hee was fortunat in getting, &amp; liberall in ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, one aſked him why he was ſo prodigal to geeue? hee aunſwered.

Thoſe which of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclinacion are ſhamefaſt, &amp; in eſtate noble, they ought aboue all things to fly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of couetouſnes: for w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out doubt greater is the honor which is loſt, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goods that are gotten. If princes and great lords of their own natural diſpoſitions bee lyberal, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> follow their nature: but if perchaunce of their own nature they are enclined to couetouſnes, let them enforce their wil. And if they wil not doo it, I tel them which are preſent, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a day ſhal come whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhal repent: for it is a general rule, that the diſordinat couetouſnes doo raiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them ſelues al venemous tongues. Think that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you watch to take mens goods, the others watch in like maner to take your honor. And if in ſuch caſe you hazard your honor, I doo not think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your life ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſure: for the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re is no law that dooth ordein, nor pacience that can ſuffer, to ſee my neighbor liue in quiet, by the ſwet of my brows. A poore man eſteemeth aſmuch a cloke, as the rich man doth his delicious life. Therefore it is a good conſequent, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if the rich man take the gown from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore: the poore man ought to take life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rich <hi>Phocion</hi> amongſt the Greeks was greatly renowmed, &amp; this not ſo much for that he was ſage, as for that hee did deſpiſe al worldly riches, vnto whom when <hi>Alexander</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great (king of <hi>Macedony</hi>) had ſent him a hundreth marks of ſiluer, hee ſaid vnto thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> brought it. Why dooth <hi>Alexander</hi> ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this money vnto mee, rather then to other philoſophers of <hi>Grece?</hi> they au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered him. He dooth ſend it vnto thee, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou art the leaſt couetous, &amp; moſt vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Then aunſwered this philoſopher. Tel <hi>Alexander</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though he knoweth not what belongeth to a prince, yet I know wel what perteineth to a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſtate &amp; office of philoſophers, is to diſpiſe the treaſures of pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: &amp; the office of princes is to aſk counſel of philoſophers. And further <hi>Phoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſaid, you ſhal ſay alſo to <hi>Alexander,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in that hee hath ſent mee, hee hath not ſhewed him ſelf a pitiful frend, but a cruel enemy: for eſteeming mee an honeſt man (ſuch as hee thought I was) hee ſhoold haue holpen mee to haue been ſuch. Theſe woords were worthy of a wiſe man. It is great pity, to ſee valya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; noble men to bee defamed of couetouſnes, &amp; only for to get a few goods, hee abaſeth him ſelf to vile offices: w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> appertein rather to mean parſons, then to noble men, &amp; valiant knights. Whereof enſueth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they liue infamed, &amp; al their frends ſlau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered. Declaring further I ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſeemeth great lightnes, that a knight ſhoold leaue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honorable ſtate of chiualry, to exerciſe the handycraft of huſbandry: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the horſe ſhoold bee changed into oxen, the ſperes to mattocks, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weapons into plows. Finally, they doo deſire to toyl in the field: &amp; refuſe to fight in the frontiers. O how much ſome knights of our time haue degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their fathers haue ben in times paſt: for their predeceſſors did adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce them ſelues of the infidels, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> in the fields they ſlew, &amp; their children brag of the corne &amp; ſhepe they haue in their grounds. Our auncient knights were not woont to ſigh, but when they ſaw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in gret diſtres: &amp; their ſucceſſors weepe now, for that it rained not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> month of May. Their fathers did ſtriue, which of them could furniſh moſt men, haue moſt weapons, &amp; keepe moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: but their children now adaies contend, who hath the fineſt witte, who can heape vp greateſt treaſour &amp; who can keepe moſt ſheep. The auncients ſtry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued who ſhould keepe moſt men: but theſe worldlings at this day ſtriue, who can haue greateſt reuenues. Wherefore I ſay, ſynce the one dooth deſyre
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21411:234"/>
aſmuch to haue great rents, as the other dyd delyght to haue many weapons: it is as though fathers ſhoold take the ſweord by the pomell, and the children by the ſcaberd. All the good arts are peruerted, and the art of chyualry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all others is deſpyſed: and not wythout cauſe I called it an art, for the auncyent phyloſophers conſumed a great tyme, to write the lawes that the knights ought to keepe. And as now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> order of the <hi>Carthagians</hi> ſeemeth to be moſt ſtreight: ſo in times paſt the order of knighthod was the ſtreighteſt. To whom I ſwere, that if they obſerued the order of chiualry, as good and gentill knights: there remayned no time vacant for them in life to be vitious, nor wee ſhould accuſe them at their death as euil chriſtians. The trew and not fayned knight, ought not to be prowd, malicious, furious, a glutton, coward, prodigal, nigard, a lyer, a blaſphemer, nor negligent. Finally I ſay, that all thoſe ought not to bee iudged as knights, which haue golden ſpurs: vnleſſe hee hath there with an honeſt life. O if it pleaſed the king of heauen, that princes would now adays examin as ſtraitly thoſe, which haue cure of ſouls: as the Romains dyd thoſe which had but charge of armies. In old time they neuer doubbed any man knight, vnleſſe he were of noble blood, proper of perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, moderat in ſpeach, exerciſed in the warre, couragious of hart, happy in Armes, and honeſt in lyfe: fynally, of all hee ought to bee beeloued for his vertue, and of none hated for hys vice. The knights in whom theſe vertues ſhyned bright in Rome had dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uers lyberties, that is to weete, that they onely myght weare ryngs, ryde on horſback thorough the ſtreats, they myght haue a ſhylde, ſhit their gates at dynner, they myght drynk in cuppes of ſiluer, ſpeake to the ſenat, and make defyaunces, they might demaund the enſigne, weare weapons, take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charge of imbaſſage, and ward at the gates of Rome. The auctour hereof, is <hi>Blondꝰ</hi> in the booke of <hi>De Italia illuſtrata.</hi> If <hi>Plinie</hi> deceiue vs not in an Epyſtle, and <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his pollitiks, <hi>Seneca</hi> in a tragedy, and <hi>Cicero</hi> in his paradoxes, there was nothing wherein the auncients were more circumſpect, then in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of their knights. Now it is not ſo, but that one hauing mony to buy a lordſhyp, immediatly hee is made knight: and that which is woorſt, when hee is made a knight, it is not to fight agaynſt the enemies in the field, but more freely to commit vices, and oppreſſe the poore in the towns. To the end hee may bee a good chriſtian, hee ought to think vpon Ieſus crucyfyed: and to bee a good knight, hee ought always to beehold the arms of hys ſhyeld, the which his graundfather, or great graundfather wanne. For they ſhall ſee, that they wanne them not beeing vicious in their houſes: but in ſheding the blood of their enemies in the frontiers.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21411:235"/>
ſent a meſſenger to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort thee: &amp; in hearing my diſeaſe, thou ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dell a frend of thine to viſit mee. Wherefore men may perceiue, if thou hadſt mee in mind, I did not forget thee. I vndeſtand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the meſſenger y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> went, &amp; the other that came, met in <hi>Capua:</hi> the one caried my deſire for thee, &amp; the other brought thy letter for mee. And if as dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly thou hadſt read mine, as I attentiuely haue hard thine: thou ſhooldſt thereby plainly know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my hart was as ful of ſorow as thy ſpyrit was ful of pain. I was very glad, &amp; great thanks I yeeld thee, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou didſt ſend to comfort mee in my feuer tertian: &amp; thy viſitacion &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort came at the ſame hour, that it left mee. But if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods did leaue this fact in my hands, euen as they thought it good to fix the feuer in my bones: I woold not leaue thee w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out comfort nor geeue place to the feuer to retourn again. O how great is our pride, &amp; the miſery of mans life. I ſpeak this, beecauſe I doo preſume to take many realms fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other, &amp; yet I haue not the power to pluck y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feuer out of my own bones. Tel mee I pray thee <hi>(Mercurius)</hi> what profit is it to vs to deſire much, to procure much, to attain much, &amp; to preſume much, ſince our days are ſo brief, &amp; our ꝑſons ſo frayl? It is long time ſince wee haue been bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d togethers in fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip, &amp; many years haue paſſed ſithe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wee haue knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the one the other: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy frendſhip truſted my faith, immediatly my faith was bound, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy euils ſhoold bee mine, &amp; my goods thine: for as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuine <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> only is true frendſhip, where the bodies are .2. &amp; the willes but one. I count y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſuſpicious frendſhip, where the harts are ſo deuided, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wils are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered: for there are diuers in Rome great frends in woords, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> dwell but ten houſes in ſunder, &amp; haue their harts ten thouſand miles diſtant. When thow wenſt from Rome, &amp; I came from <hi>Samia,</hi> thou knowſt the agreement w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> wee made in <hi>Capua,</hi> whereof I truſt thou wilt not deceiue mee now, but that I am another thou here, &amp; that thou ſhooldſt bee another I there: ſo that my abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with thy preſence, &amp; thy preſence wyth mine abſence bee always together. By relacion of thy meſſenger, I vnderſtoode that thou hadſt loſt much goods: but as by thy letter I was enformed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> anguiſh of thy parſon was much greater. As wee vnderſtand here thou didſt ſend a ſhip laden w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> marchandiſe to <hi>Grece,</hi> &amp; the mariners &amp; factours deſiring more to profit by their wiſedome, then to accompliſh thy couetouſnes: did caſt the marchandiſe into the Sea, &amp; only they trauailed to ſaue their perſons. In deede in ſo ſtreyght &amp; perilous a caſe, thou haſt no reaſon to accuſe them, nor yet they are bound to ſatiſfy thee: for no man can commit greater folly, then for the goods of others to hazard his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre life. Pardon mee <hi>(Mercury)</hi> I pray thee for that I haue ſpoken, &amp; allſo for that I wil ſay, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is, that for ſo much as the mariners &amp; factours were not thy children, nor thy kinſmen, nor thy frends: ſo that thy marchandiſe might haue come to the haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſafe, thou hadſt lytle paſſed if they had al been drowned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deepe goulf of the ſea. Further I ſay, though I woold not ſay it, &amp; thow much leſſe here it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> according to the litle care which you other couetous men haue, of the children &amp; factors of others, and according to the diſordinat loue w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> yow haue to your proper goods; where as thou weepeſt bitterly for the loſſe of thy goods, though thou hadſt ſeen al the mariners drowned, thou wooldſt not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſhed one teare. For Romain marchants weepe rather for ten crowns loſt, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they can not recouer: then for ten men dying, the which ten crowns woold haue ſaued. Mee thinketh it is neither iuſt, nor honeſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou doo that whych
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21411:235"/>
they tell mee thou dooſt, to complain of thy factours, and accuſe the maryners: only to recouer of the poore men by land, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which the fiſh haue in their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Sea. For as thou knoweſt, no man is bound to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge health, life, nor the renowm of their parſons, for the recouery of goods. Alas, what pyty haue I on thee <hi>Mercury,</hi> in that the ſhip was loden with thy marchandiſe: and the woorſt of all is, that according to my vnderſtanding, &amp; thy feelyng, the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats haue not caſt ſuch fardels into the ſea, as thoughts hath burdened &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed thy hart. I neuer ſaw man of ſuch condicion as thou art, for that thow ſeeſt that the ſhyp (vntil ſuch time) as they caſt that marchandiſe ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boord could not ſaile ſafely: and yet thou dooſt lode thy ſelf with ryches to goe to thy graue. O greeuous and curſed riches, with the which neither in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deepe ſeas, neither yet in the main land, our parſons are in ſafegard. Knowing thy proper<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty, I woold rather binde my ſelf to ſeeke thy lead &amp; tinne: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy hart ſo wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For in the end, thy lead is together in ſome place in the bottom of the ſea: but thy couetouſnes is ſcattered through al the whole earth. If perhaps thou ſhooldſt dye, and the ſurgions with the ſharp raſer ſhould open thy ſtomack, I ſweare vnto thee, by the mother <hi>Berecinthe,</hi> (which is the mother of all the gods of Rome) that they ſhoold rather fynd thy hart drowned w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> the lead: then in life with thy body. Now thow canſt not bee ſick of the feuer tertian as I am, for the heate w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in thy body, &amp; the pain in thy head, woold cauſe thee to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue a double quartain: and of ſuch diſeaſe thou canſt not bee healed in thy bed, but in the ſhyp, not in land, but in the ſea, not with phiſitions, but with pirats. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> phiſicions woold cary away the money, and the pyrats woold ſhew thee where thy lead fel. Trouble not thy ſelf ſo much <hi>Mercury,</hi> for though thou haſt not thy lead with thee in the land, it hath thee with it in the ſea, and thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt inough to comfort thy ſelf: for where as beefore thou hadſt it in thy cofers, thou haſt it preſently in thy intrailes. For there thy life is drowned, where thy lead is caſt. O <hi>Mercury</hi> now thou knoweſt, that the day that thou didſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thy goods to the vnknowen rocks, and thy ſhyp to the ragyng ſeas, and thy outragious auarice to the furious wynds, how much that thy factors went deſyryng thy profyt, and gayn: ſo much the more thow mightſt haue been aſſured of thy loſſe. Yf thou hadſt had this conſyderacion, and hadſt vſed this diligence: thy deſire had been drowned, and thy goods eſcaped. For men that dare aduenture their goods on the ſea, they ought not to bee heauy for that that is loſt: but they ought to reioyce for that that is eſcaped. <hi>Socrates,</hi> the auncyent and great Phyloſopher determyned to teach vs, not by woord, but by woork, in what eſtimacion a man ought to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goods of this world: for hee caſt in the ſea not lead, but gold, not litle, but much, not of another mans, but of his own, not by force, but willingly, not by fortune, but by wiſedome. Finally in this woorthy fact hee ſhewed ſo great courage, that no couetous man woold haue reioyced, to haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſo much in the land: as thys phyloſopher did delyght, to haue caſt in the ſea. That which <hi>Socrates</hi> dyd was much, but greater ought wee to eſteme that hee ſayd, which was: O ye diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceytfull goods, I will drown you, rather then you ſhoold drown mee. Since <hi>Socrates</hi> feared, and drowned hys own proper goods: why doo not the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous feare to robbe the goods of other? Thys wyſe Philoſopher woold not
<pb facs="tcp:21411:236"/>
truſt the fyne gold: and thou dooſt truſt the hard lead. Draw you two lottes, <hi>Socrates</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> and thou of <hi>Samia.</hi> See which of you two haue erred or doone well: hee to cary gold from the land to the Sea, or thou by the Sea, to bring gold to the land. I am aſſured, that the auncyent Romayns woold ſay that it is hee: but the couetous of this preſent world would ſay, that it is thou. That which in this caſe I thynk is, that thou in prayſyng yt, dooſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayſe thy ſelf: and <hi>Socrates</hi> in dyſprayſyng it, of all is prayſed and eſteemed.</p>

                     <p>THis meſſenger told mee, that thou art very ſad, that thou cryeſt out in the night, and importuneſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods, wakeſt thy neighbors, and aboue all, that thou complaineſt of fortune which hath vſed thee ſo euill. I am ſory for thy grief: for grief is a frend of ſolytude, enemy of company, a louer of darknes, ſtraunge in conuerſation, &amp; heire of deſperacion. I am ſory thou cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the night, for it is a ſigne of folly, a token of ſmal pacience, the point of no wiſe man, and a great proof of ignoraunce: for at the hour when al the world is couered with darknes, thou alone dooſt diſcouer thy hart with exclamaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

For as much as wee offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the gods through the offence, ſo much doo wee appeaſe them with pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

I am ſory thou complaineſt of thy fortune: For fortune (ſith ſhee is knowen of al) dooth not ſuffer her ſelf to bee defamed of one: and it is better to thynk wyth fortune how thou mayſt remedy it, then to thynk with what grief to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playn.

By the fayth of a good man I ſweare vnto thee, that if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance thou buyeſt any thing of that that is there, or ſelleſt ought of that thou bringeſt from thence: thou ſhalt haue greater hunger of that thou ſhalt leaue, then contentacion of that thou ſhalt bryng. Thou dooſt not remember that wee are in winter, and that thou muſt paſſe the ſea, in the which if the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats doo not deceiue mee, the ſureſt tranquyllyty, is a ſigne of the greateſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thow myghtſt tel mee, that thy ſhips ſhould retourn without frayt, and therefore they ſhal ſayle more ſurely. To this I aunſwere thee, that thou ſhalt ſend them more loden with couetouſneſſe: then they ſhall returne loden with ſilks. O what a good chaunge ſhoold it bee, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auarice of <hi>Italy</hi> coold bee chaunged, for the ſilk of <hi>Alexandry.</hi> I ſweare vnto thee, that in ſuch caſe thy ſylk woold frayght a ſhyp: and our couetyſe woold lode a whole nauy.

or els auaryce and couetouſnes ſurmounteth. To ſatiſfy mee, and to excuſe thee with thoſe which ſpeak to mee of thee, I can not tell what to ſay vnto them, but that GOD hath forgotten thee, and the ſeas doo know thee. I pray thee what goeſt thow to ſeeke, ſynce thow leaueſt the gouernaunce of thy howſe, and ſayleſt in <hi>Alexandrie?</hi> Peraduenture thow goeſt to the goulph <hi>Arpyn,</hi> where the maryners caſt in thy lead?</p>

I haue knowen many in Rome, which for to recouer one part of that that they haue loſt, haue loſt all that which was left vnto them. O my frend <hi>Mercury,</hi> note, note, note well this laſt woord, whereby thou ſhalt know what it is that you couetous men gape for in this life. Thou ſeekeſt care for thy ſelfe, enuy for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neighbours, ſpurs for ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, a bayt for theeues, troubles for thy body, damnacion for thy renowm, vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quietnes for thy life, annoyance for thy frends, and occaſion for thy ennemies.

                     <p>
                        <hi>MYdas</hi> the auncient kyng of <hi>Phrigia,</hi> was in his gouernment a cruell ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and contented not him ſelf to play the tiraunt in his own proper countrey, but alſo mainteined rouers on the ſea, and theeues in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to robbe ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers. This king <hi>Mydas</hi> was wel knowen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> realms of orient, and in ſuch ſort, that a frend of his of <hi>Thebes</hi> ſayd vnto him theſe woords. I let thee to weete king <hi>Mydas,</hi> that all thoſe of thy own realm doo hate thee, and al the other realms of <hi>Aſia</hi> doo feare thee: and this not for that thou canſt doo much, but for the crafts and ſubtilties which thou vſeſt. By reaſon where of, all ſtraungers, and all thine own haue made a vow to god, neuer to laugh during the time of thy life: nor yet to weepe after thy death. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in the book of pollitiques ſayth, that when this king <hi>Mydas</hi> was born, the ants brought corn into his cradel, and into his mouth: and when the nurſe woold haue taken it from him, he ſhut his mouth, and woold not ſuffer any parſon to take it from him. They beeing all amazed with this ſtraunge ſight, demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the oracle what this beetokened. Who aunſwered, that the chyld ſhould bee marueilous rych, and with that exceeding couetous: which the ants
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21411:237"/>
dyd beetoken in fylling his mouth with corne. And afterwards hee woold not geeue them one onely grayn and euen ſo it chaunced, that kyng <hi>Mydas</hi> was exceedyng rych, and allſo very couetous: for hee woold neuer geeue any thyng, but that which by force was taken from him, or by ſubtelty robbed. In the ſchools of <hi>Athens</hi> at that tyme floriſhed a philoſopher called <hi>Sylenus,</hi> who in letters and purenes of lyfe, was highly renowmed. And as kyng <hi>Mydas</hi> was knowen of many, to haue great treaſures: ſo this phyloſopher <hi>Silenus,</hi> was no leſſe noted for deſpyſyng them. This phyloſopher <hi>Silenus</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaylyng by the borders of <hi>Phrigia,</hi> was taken by the theeues whych robbed the countrey: and beeing brought beefore kyng <hi>Mydas,</hi> the kyng ſayd vnto hym. Thow art a phyloſopher, and I am a kyng: thou art my priſoner, and I am thy lord: I wyll that immedyatly thow tell mee, what raunſome thou canſt geeue mee to redeeme thy parſon: for I let thee to weete that I am not contented any phloſopher ſhoold peryſh in my countrey, becauſe you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther philoſophers ſay, that yow wyll willyngly renounce the goods of the world, ſyth yow can not haue it. The phyloſopher <hi>Silenus</hi> aunſwered hym. Mee thinketh (kyng <hi>Mydas</hi>) that thou canſt better execut tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny, then to talk of phyloſophy: for wee make no accompt that our bodies bee taken, but that our willes bee at lyberty. Thy demaund is very ſymple, to demaund raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of mee for my parſon, whether thow takeſt mee for a phyloſopher or no. If I bee not a phyloſopher, what mooueth thee to feare to keepe mee in thy realme? for ſooner ſhooldſt thow make mee a tyrant, then I thee a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher. If thou takeſt mee for a phyloſopher, why dooſt thow demaund money of mee? ſins thow knowſt I am a phyloſopher, I am a crafteſman, I am a poet, and alſo a muſicion. So that the time that thow in heapyng vp riches haſt conſumed: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſelfſame tyme haue I in learning ſciences ſpent. Of a phyloſopher to demaund eyther gold or ſiluer for raunſome of hys par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is either a woord in mockery, or els an inuention of tyranny, For ſithens I was borne in the world, riches neuer came into my hands, nor after them hath my hart luſted. If thou (kyng <hi>Mydas</hi>) wooldſt geeue mee audience and in the fayth of a prynce beeleeue mee, I woold tell thee what is the greateſt thyng, and next vnto that the ſecond, that the gods may geeue in this life: and it may bee, that it ſhalbee ſo pleaſaunt vnto thee to here, and ſo profytable for thy lyfe, that thou wilt pluck mee from my enemies, and I may diſwade thee from tirannies. When king <hi>Mydas</hi> hard theſe woords, hee gaue him ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to ſay theſe two things, ſwearing vnto him to heare him wyth as much pacyence as was poſſible. The phyloſopher <hi>Silenus,</hi> hauyng lycence to ſpeak freely, taking an inſtrument in his hands, beeganne to play and ſyng in thys wyſe.</p>

Without doubt the ſentences were marueilous profound, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> philoſopher ſpake: and great reaſon had that king to eſteeme it ſo much. For if wee doo prepare our ſelues to conſider whereof wee are, and what wee ſhall bee, that is to weete, that wee are of earth, and that wee ſhall retourn to earth: Wee woold not ceaſe to weepe nor ſygh.</p>
                     <p>One of the greateſt vanities which I fynd among the children of vanity is, that they imploy them ſelues to conſyder the influences of the ſtarres, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the planets, the motion of the heauens, and they wil not conſider them ſelues of which conſyderacion they ſhoold take ſome profyt.</p>
                     <p>For man geeuing his minde to think on ſtraunge things, commeth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his own propre. O if wee woold conſider the corruption whereof wee are made, the fylth whereof wee are ingendred, the infinit trauaile wherew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee are borne, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> long tediouſnes wherew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee are noriſhed, the great neceſſities and ſuſpicions wherein wee liue, and aboue all, the great peryll where in wee dye: I ſweare, and affirme that in ſuch conſideracion wee fynd a thouſand oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to wyſh death, and not one to deſire life. The children of vanyty are occupyed many years in the ſchools to learn rethoryk, they excerciſe them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in philoſophy, they here <hi>Ariſtottel,</hi> they learn <hi>Homere</hi> without booke, they ſtudy <hi>Cicero,</hi> they are occupied in <hi>Xenophon,</hi> they herken <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> they forget not <hi>Aulus Gelius</hi> and they know <hi>Ouide:</hi> yet for all this I ſay, that wee can not ſay that the man knoweth lytell, which doth know him ſelf. <hi>Eſchines</hi> the philoſopher ſayd well, that it is not the leaſt, but the chiefeſt part of phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy to know man, and wherefore hee was made: for if man woold deepely conſyder what man is, hee ſhoold fynd mo things in him, which woold moue him to humble him ſelf, then to ſtirre him to bee proud. If wee doo beeholdyt without paſſion, and if wee doo examin it with reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I know not what there is in man. O miſerable and fraile nature of man, the which taken by it ſelf is littel woorth: and compared with an other thing is much leſſe. For man ſeeth in brute beaſts many things which hee doth e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uy: and the beaſts doo ſee much more in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whereo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yf they had reaſon, they woold haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion. The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the ſoule layd aſyde, and the hope which wee haue of eternall lyfe, yf man doo compare the captyuyty of men to the lyberty of beaſts, wyth reaſon wee may ſee, that the beaſts doo liue a peacible life: and that which men doo lead, is but a long death. If wee prepare our ſelues to conſyder, from the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me that both man and beaſt come into this world, vntill ſuch time as they both dy, and in how many things the beaſts are better then men: with reaſon wee may ſay, that nature lyke a pitifull mother hath ſhewed her ſelf to beaſts, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee doth handle vs as an iniuſt ſtepmother. Let vs beeginne therefore to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare more particularly the original of the one, and the beginning of the other: &amp; wee ſhall ſee how much better the brute beaſts are endowed, &amp; how y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable men are diſherited.</p>

                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:21411:238"/>WE ought deepely to conſyder, that no wilde nor tame beaſt is ſo long beefore hee come to his ſhape, as the myſerable man is: who wyth corruption of blood &amp; vile matter, is nine moneths hyd in the womb of his mother. Wee ſee the beaſt when ſhee is great (if neede require) doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor all exerciſes of huſbandry: ſo that ſhee is as ready to labor when ſhee is great, as if ſhee were empty. The contrary happeneth to women, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are bigge with childe, are weary with going, troubled to bee layd, they ryde in chariots through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> market places, they eat lytle, they brooke not that they haue eaten, they hate that which is profytable, &amp; loue that which doth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> harm: Fynally a woman with childe is contented with nothing, and ſhee fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and vexeth with her ſelf. Sithens therefore it is true, that wee are noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and troubleſome to our mothers, when they beare vs in theire wombs: why doo not wee geeue them ſome ſafe conduct, when they are in their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering? O myſerable ſtate of man, ſince the brute beaſts are borne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troying their mothers: but the miſerable men beefore they are born, are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and carefull, and in the time of their birth, are both perillous to them ſelues, and daungerous to their mothers. Which ſeemeth to bee very many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: for the preparacion that man maketh when hee will dy, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſelf ſame aught the woman to doo, when ſhee is ready to bee delyuered. Wee muſt alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that though a beaſt hath but two feete, as the birds haue, hee can go, moue, and runne, immediatly when it commeth foorth: but when ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is born, hee can not go, nor moue, &amp; much leſſe ronne. So that a popingey ought more to bee eſteemed, which hath no hands: then the man which hath both hands and feete. That which they doo to the lytle babe, is not but a prognoſtication of that which hee ought to ſuffer in the progreſſe of hys lyfe: that is to weete. That as they are not contented to put y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euil dooer in priſon, but they lode his hands with yrons, &amp; ſet his feete in the ſtocks: ſo in like maner to the miſerable man, when hee entreth into the charter of his life, immediatly they bind both his hands &amp; his feete, &amp; lay him in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cradel. So that the innocent babe is firſt bound &amp; rolled, beefore hee bee imbraced, or haue ſuck of the mother. Wee muſt note alſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the hour wherein the beaſt is brought foorth, though it know not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sier which begat it, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt it knoweth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> damme which brought it foorth: which is apparant, for ſo much as if the mother haue milk, the yongling foorth with dooth ſuck her teats: &amp; if perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhe haue no milk, they go afterwards to hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues vnder her wings: Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſerable man it is not ſo, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day that hee is born, hee knoweth not the nurſe that geeueth him ſuck, neyther the father which hath beegotten him, the mother which hath born him, nor yet the midwife which hath receiued him: moreouer hee can not ſee with his eies, heare with his eares nor iudge with the taſt, and knoweth neither what it is to touch, or ſmel: ſo that wee ſee him, to whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeygnory ouer al brute beaſts and other things (that are created) parteineth, to bee born the moſt vnable of all other creatures. Wee muſt alſo conſyder, that though the beaſt bee neuer ſo litle, yet it can ſeeke for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teates of his mother to ſuck, or to wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fields to feede, or to ſcrape y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ghilles to eat, or els it goeth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayns &amp; riuers to drink, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he lerneth not by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diſcours of time, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any other beaſt hath taught it, but as ſoon as it is born, ſo ſone doth it know what thing is neceſſary for it.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:239"/>
The myſerable man is not borne wyth ſo many preſent commodities, hee can not eat, drynk, nor go, make hym ſelf ready, aſk, nor yet complayn, and that which is more, hee knoweth not ſcarcely how to ſuck, for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers oft tymes woold geeue to their children (if they could) the blood of their hart: and yet they can not cauſe them to take the mylk of their breaſts. O great myſery of mans nature, forſomuch as the brute beaſts as ſoone as they are come foorth of theire mothers womb, can know and ſeeke: but when yt is offered vnto man, hee can not know it. Wee muſt note alſo, that to brute beaſts nature hath geeuen clothing, wherewyth they may keepe them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues from the heat of Sommer, and defend them ſelues from the cold of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: which is manyfeſt, for that to lambs and ſheepe ſhee hath geeuen wooll, to byrds feathers, to hoggs briſtels, to horſes heare, to fyſh ſcales, &amp; to ſnayles ſhells. Fynally I ſay, there is no beaſt which hath neede with his hands to make any garment, nor yet to borow it of another. Of all this the myſerable man is depryued, who is borne all naked, and dyeth all naked, not carying wyth him one only garment: and if in the tyme of his lyfe hee will vſe any garment, hee muſt demaund of the beaſts, both leather and wooll: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto hee muſt alſo put his whole labor and induſtry.</p>
                     <p>I woold aſk princes, and great lords, if when they are borne, they bryng wyth them any apparel: and when they dy, if they cary wyth them any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour? To this I aunſwere no: but they die as they are borne, as well the rych as the poore, and the poore as the rich. And admit that in this life fortune doth make difference beetweene vs in eſtates, yet nature in time of our birth, and death, doth make vs all equall. Wee muſt alſo think and conſider, that forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as nature hath prouyded the beaſts of garments, ſhee hath alſo taken from them the care of what they ought to eat: for there is no beaſt that doth eyther plow, ſow, or labor, but doth content her ſelfe, and paſſeth her lyfe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the lytle flyes of the ayre, with the corne that ſhee fyndeth in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, with the herbs in the fyelds, with the ants of the earth, with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes of the vyne, or with the fruits which are fallen. Finally I ſay, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out care all beaſts take their reſt, as if the next day followyng they ſhoold haue no neede to eat. O what a great benefit ſhoold god doo to the myſerable man, yf hee had taken from hym the trauaile to apparel him ſelf, and the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to ſearch for things to eat. But what ſhal the poore miſerable man do, that beefore hee eateth, hee muſt till, ſow, hee muſt reap, and threſh the corne, hee muſt clenſe it, griend it, paſte it, and bake it, and it can not bee prouyded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out care of mynd, nor bee doon without the propre ſwet of the brows. And yf perchaunce any man did prouide for him ſelf with the ſwet of others, yet ſhal hee liue with his owne offences. Alſo in other things the beaſts do excell vs: for in the flowers, in the leaues, in the hearbs, in the ſtraw, in the otes, in the bread, in the fleſh, or in the fruit whych they eat, or in the water which they drink, they feele no pain, although it bee not ſweete: nor take any diſpleaſure, though their meates bee not ſauory. Fynally, ſuch as nature hath prouided them, without diſgyſing or makyng them ſelues better, they are contented to eat. Man coold loſe nothing, if in this poynt hee agreed with beaſts: but I am very ſory, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are many vicious &amp; proud men, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing wanteth either to apparail, or eat: but they haue to much to maintein them ſelues, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21411:239"/>
here with not contended, they are ſuch dronkardes to taſt of diuers wines, and ſuch <hi>Epicures</hi> to eat of ſundry ſorts of meates: that oft times they ſpend more to dreſſe them, then they did coſt the bying. Now when the beaſtes are brought foorth, they haue knowledge both of that that is profitable, and alſo of that that is hurtful for them. For wee ſee this, that the ſheepe flyeth the wolf, the catt flyeth the dog, the ratt flyeth the catt, and the chicken the kyte: ſo that the beaſts in opening the eyes, doo immediatly know the frends who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ought to folow, and the enemies whom they ought to fly. To the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man, was vtterly denyed this ſo great priuilege. For in the world there hath been many beaſtly men, who hath not onely attained that, which they ought to know whiles they lyued: but alſo euen as like beaſts they paſſed their daies in this life, ſo they were infamed at the tyme of their death. O mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable creatures y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee are, which lyue in this wicked world, for wee know not what is hurtfull for vs, what wee ought to eat, from what wee ought to abſtain, nor yet whom wee ſhoold hate: wee doo not agree with thoſe whom wee ought to loue, wee know not in whom to put our truſt, from whom wee ought to fly, nor what it is wee ought too chooſe, nor yet what wee ought to forſake. Finally I ſay, that when wee think oft times to enter into a ſure ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, within .3. ſteps afterward wee fall headlong into the deepe ſea. Wee ought alſo to conſider, that both to wild and tame beaſts, nature hath geeuen armes, or weapons to defend them ſelues, and to aſſault their enemies, as it appeareth, for that to birds ſhee hath geeuen wings, to the harts ſwiftfeete, to the Elephants, tuſhes, to the ſerpents ſcales, to the Eagle tallons, to the Faucon a beake, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyons teeth, to the bulles hornes, and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bears pawes, Finally I ſay, that ſhee hath geeuen to the Foxes ſubtilty to know how to hyde them ſelues in the earth, and to the fiſhes lyttle finnes how to ſwim in the water. Admit that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wretched men haue few enemies, yet in this they are none otherwiſe priuileged then the beaſts: for wee ſee (without teares it cannot bee told) that the beaſts which for the ſeruice of men were created, with the ſelf ſame beaſtes, men are now adays troubled, and offended. And to the end it ſeeme not wee ſhould talk of pleaſure, let euery man think with him ſelf, what it is that wee ſuffer with the beaſts of this life: For the Lyons do fear vs, the wolfes deuoure our ſheepe, the dogges doo bite vs, the cattes ſcratche vs, the Bear doth tear vs, the ſerpents poyſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, the Bulles hurt vs, with their horns, the birds do ouerfly vs, the ratts doo trouble vs, the ſpiders do annoy vs, and the woorſt of all is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a litel flye ſucketh our blood in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day, &amp; the poore flea doth let vs from ſlepe in the night. O poore and miſerable ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who for to ſuſtein this wretched life, is enforced to begge al things that hee needeth of the beaſtes. For the beaſts do geeue him wool, the beaſt do draw him water, the beaſts do cary him him from place to place, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beaſts do plough the land, and carieth the corn into their barnes. Finally I ſaye, that if the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receiue any good, he hath not wherwith to make recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: &amp; if they doo him any euill, he hath nought but the tong to reuenge. Wee muſt note alſo that though a man lode a beſt with ſtripes, beate her, driue her by the foule wayes though he taketh her meat from her, yea though her yonglings dye: yet for none of all theſe things ſhee is ſad, or ſorowfull, and much leſſe doth weepe, &amp; though ſhee ſhould weepe, ſhee cannot. For beaſts little eſteame their life,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:240"/>
&amp; much leſſe feare death. It is not ſo of the vnhappy and wretched ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which can not but bewayle the vnthankfullnes of their frends, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the want which they haue of neceſſityes, the caſe of aduerſitie which doo ſuccede theim, the falſe witnes which is brought againſt theym, and a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d calamities whice doo torment their harts. Fynally I ſay, that the greateſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that men haue in this life, is to make a riuer of water with the teares of their eyes. Let vs inquire of princes and great lords, what they can doo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are borne, whether they can ſpeak as oratours, if they can ronne as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, if they can gouerne them ſelues as kinges, if they can fyght as men of warre, if they can labor as laborers, if they can woork as the maſons, if they knew to teach as maiſters, theſe litell children would aunſwer, that they are not onely ignoraunt of all that wee demaund of them, but alſo that they can not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it. Let vs retourne to aſk them what is that they know, ſince they know nothing of that wee haue demaunded them? they wil aunſwer that they can doo none other thing, but weepe at their byrth, and ſorow at their death. Though al thoſe (which ſayle in this ſo perillous ſea) doo reioyce and take pleaſure, and ſeeme too ſleap ſoundly: yet at the laſt there cometh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> winde of aduerſity, which maketh them al to know their foly. For if I bee not deceyued, and if I know any thing of this world: thoſe which I haue ſeene at the time of their birth take ſhipp weeping: I doubt whether they will take land in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue laughing. O vnhappy life (I ſhoold ſay rather death) which the mortalls take for life, wherein afterwards wee muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume a great time, to learn all arts, ſciences, and offices: and yet notwithſtanding, that whereof wee are ignorante, is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which wee know. Wee forget the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part ſaue only that of weeping, which no man needeth to learn: for wee are borne, and liue weeping, and vntill this preſent wee haue ſeene none dye inioy. Wee muſt note alſo that the beaſts doo lyue and dye, with the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where with they were borne: that is to weete, that the wolfe foloweth the ſheepe, and not the birds: the hounds follow the hares, and not the ratts: the ſparrow flyeth at the birds, and not at the fiſh: the ſpider eateth the flyes, and not the herbs. Finally I ſay, that if wee let the beaſt ſearch hys meat quietly, wee ſhall not ſee hym geeuen to any other thing.</p>
                     <p>The contrary of al this happeneth to men, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which though nature hath cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ated feeble, yet Gods inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not they ſhould bee malitious: but I am ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſince they cannot auoyde debilyty, that they turne it into malice. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption which they haue to bee good, they turne to pryde: and the deſire they haue to bee innocent, they tourne into enuy. The fury which they ſhould take againſt malice, they turne into anger: and the liberality they ought to haue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thee good, they conuerte into auaryce. The neceſſity they haue to eat, they turne into gluttony: and the care they ought to haue of their conſcience, they turne into neglygence. Finally I ſay, that the more ſtrength beaſts haue, the more they ſerue: and the leſſe men are worth, ſomuch the more thanks haue they of god. The innocency of the brute beaſt conſydered, and the malice of the malitious man marked: without compariſon, the company of the brute beaſt is leſſe hurtfull, then the conuerſation of euil men.</p>
                     <p>For in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, if yee bee conuerſant with a beaſt, yee haue not but to beeware of her: but if yee be in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany with a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is nothing where in yee ought
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:21411:240"/>
to truſt him. Wee muſt note alſo, that it was neyther ſeene, or read, that there was any beaſt that took care for the graue: but the beaſts beeing dead, ſome ore torne in peeces with Lyons, other dyſmembred by the bears, others gnawn with dogs, other remaine in the fylds, other are eaten of men, and other by the ants. Finally, the intralles of the one, are the graues of others. It is not ſo of the myſerable man, the which conſumeth no ſmall treaſure to make his tombe, which is the moſt vayneſt thing that is in this miſerable lyfe for there is no greater vanity, nor lyghtnes in man, then to bee eſteemed for his goodli and ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous ſepulture, and lytell to way a good lyfe. I will ſwere, that at this day all the dead doo ſweare, that they care lytell if their bodyes bee buried in the deepe Seas, or in the golden tombs, or that the cruel beaſts haue eaten them, or that they remayne in the fields without a graue: ſo that their ſoules may bee among the celeſtiall companies. Speaking after the law of a chriſtian, I durſt ſay that it profiteth lytell the body to bee among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paynted and carued ſtones: when the myſerable ſoul is burning, in the fyrye flames of hell. O miſerable creatures, haue not wee ſuffycient where with to ſeeke in this lyfe, to procure, to trauaile, to accompliſh, to ſygh, and alſo what to beewayle, with out hauyng ſuch care and anguyſh, to know where they ſhalbee buryed? Is there any man ſo vaine, that hee dooth not care that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther menn ſhoold condempn his euill lyfe: ſo that they prayſe his rych Tomb? To thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are liuing I ſpeak and ſay of thoſe that are dead: that if a man gaue theym leaue to returne in to the world, they would bee occupied more to correct theyr exceſſe, and offences: then to adourne and repaire their graues and tombs, though they found them fallen down. I cannot tell what to ſay, more in this caſe, but to admonyſh men that it is great folly to make any great accompte of the graues.</p>

                     <head>¶The Emperor Marcus Aurelius writeth this letter to Domitius a citezin of Capua to comfort him in his exile, beeing baniſhed for a quarell beetwixt him and an other about the ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning of a hors, very comfortable to thoſe that haue been in fauor and now fallen in diſgrace. Cap. xxxiiii.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>MArke</hi> the Romain Emperor, borne at mount <hi>Celio,</hi> to thee <hi>Domitiꝰ</hi> of <hi>Capua,</hi> wyſheth health, and conſolation from Gods the onely comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The bitter winter in theſe parts, haue reiſed boiſterus wynds, and the winds haue cauſed much rayn, and the much rayn hath cauſed great moyſtures: the which engendreth in mee ſondry dyſeaſes. Among the which the gowt of my hands is one, and the <hi>Siatica</hi> in my legge is another. <hi>Eſchines</hi> the philoſopher ſaid, that the liberty of the ſoul and the health of the bodi, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bee eſteemed to much &amp; much leſſe alſo bee bought for mony. Tell mee I pray thee, what can hee doo or what is hee worth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath neither lyberti, nor health? The deuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his bookes of his common wealth, reciteth three things.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, that the man which oweth nothing, cannot ſay that hee is poore. For the day that I ow money to another, another and not my ſelf is lord of myne own. The ſecond, the man which is no ſeruant, nor captiue, hath not reaſon to ſay that any thing may make hym vnhappy. For fortune in nothing
<pb facs="tcp:21411:241"/>
ſheweth her ſelfe ſo cruel, as to take from vs the liberty of this life.</p>
                     <p>The third which <hi>Plato</hi> ſaied, is that among all temporall goods ther is none more greater, nor greater felicity, then the treaſure of health. For the man which is perſecuted with ſicknes, with ryches can haue no conten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tacion. In the time of our old fathers, when Rome was well corrected, they did not only ordeine the things of their common wealth: but alſo they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyded for that which touched the health of euery perſon. So that they wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to cure the body, and they were circumſpect to deſtroy vices. In the time of <hi>Gneus Patroclus,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Albus,</hi> they ſay that the city of Rome was ordinarily vyſyted with ſicknes. Wherefore firſt they dyd forbyd, that in the moneth of Iuly, and Auguſtus, there ſhould bee no ſtewes for women. For the bloud of the yong, was corrupted in venerial actes.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, that no man ſhould bring any fruit from <hi>Salon,</hi> nor <hi>Campania,</hi> to ſell during theſe .2. moneths in Rome. For the delicate ladies of Rome for extreame heat, and the poore for their pouerty, dyd not eat in ſommer but fruyts: and ſo the market places were full of fruyts, and the houſes ful of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues. The third, they did defend that no inhabitaunt ſhould bee ſo hardy, to walk after the ſunn were ſet. For the yong men, thorough the lightnes they vſed in the nights, tooke dyſeaſes which vexed them in the days.</p>
                     <p>The fourth, they did prohibit that no man ſhould bee ſo hardy, to ſell openly in Rome wyne of <hi>Candie,</hi> or <hi>Spaine.</hi> For in the great heat of the ſommer, as the ſunne is very whot, ſo the wyne as poyſon dooth kil yong men.</p>
                     <p>The fifth, that they ſhoold purge the priuyes, and make clean the ſtreats and houſes. For of the corruption of the ayer, is engendred the plague a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people. When Rome was rych, when Rome proſpered, all theſe things were obſerued in the common wealth. But ſince <hi>Catilina</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant dyd rebell, ſince <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi> dyd ſlaunder it, ſince <hi>Ceſar</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius</hi> dyd play the tiraunts, ſince <hi>Octauius Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> dyd robb it, ſince <hi>Calligula</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> did defame it, they cared litel whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they entred into Rome, to ſell the wine of <hi>Spaine</hi> or <hi>Candia.</hi> For they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more the knife of the enemies: then the heat of the ſommer. Great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had the auncients to forbyd thoſe thinges in Rome, for, to ſay the trouth they are not healthfull. When I was yong in Rome, my head dyd not ake with talking in the nyght, nor I did feele my blood chafed wyth drinkyng wine. Then I was not troubled to iette in the heat in the ſommer, nor I was annoyed to goo bare legged in the wynter.</p>
                     <p>But now that I am old, there is no heat but offendeth mee, nor cold but perſeth mee. For men through much euyll rule in their youth, come to greauous dyſeaſes in theyr age. O if mortall men, after that they bee old could at any tyme woork with the gods, that they ſhoold beecome yong agayne: I ſwere vnto thee, by the fayth of a good man, that they woold beehaue them ſelues ſo well, that the world ſhould not agayne deceiue them. Since men haue been vicious in their youth, I doo not meruell though they are full of dyſeaſes when they are old. For how can hee loue hys health, which hateth vertu? All that which I haue ſpoken heere beefore is to the end you may know and beeleeue that I am ſick, and that I
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21411:241"/>
cannot write vnto the ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as I would, and as thou deſireſt: ſo that hereof it followeth, that I ſhall bewayle thy payne, and thou ſhalt bee greeued with my gowte. I vnderſtood here how at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feaſt of the god <hi>Ianus,</hi> through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a horſe, great ſtryfe is ryſen beetweene thee and thy neighbour <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triciꝰ:</hi> And the brute was ſuch, that they haue confiſcated thy goods, battered thy houſe, baniſhed thy children, &amp; depriued thee from the Senate for x. years.</p>
                     <p>And further, they baniſhed thee out of <hi>Capua</hi> for euer, &amp; haue put thy felow in the priſon Mamortine: ſo that by this lytle fury, thou haſt cauſe to lament all the dayes of thy lyfe. All thoſe which come from thens doo tell vs, that thou art ſo wofull in thy hart, and ſo chaunged in thy parſon: that thou dooſt not forget thy heauy chaunces, nor receiueſt conſolation of thy faithfull freends.</p>
                     <p>Think not that I ſpeak this, that thou ſhouldeſt bee offended: for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the often chaunges which fortune hath ſhewed in mee, it is long ſince I knew what ſorow ment. For truly the man which is ſorowfull, ſigheth in the day, watcheth, in the night, delyteth not in company, and with only care hee reſteth. The light hee hateth, the darkenes hee loueth, with bitter tears he watereth the earth, with heuy ſighes hee perceth the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, with infinite ſorows he remembreth that that is paſt, and forſeeth nothing that that to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e is. Hee is diſpleaſed with hym that dooth comfort hym, and hee taketh reſt to expreſſe his ſorowes. Fynally, the vnfortunat man is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with nothing, and with hym ſelf continually hee doth chafe. Beeleue mee <hi>Domitiꝰ,</hi> that if I haue well touched the condicions of the ſorowfull man, it is for no other cauſe, but for that my euill fortune hath made mee taſt them all. And herof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that I can ſo wel dyſcribe them: for in the end, in things which touche the ſorrows of the ſpiryte, and the troubles of the body, there is great dyffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from hym that hath read them, and from hym that hath felt them. If thou dydſt feele it there, as I doo fele it heer, it is ſuffycient to geeue thee and thy frends great dolor, to think that for ſo ſmall a trifle thou ſhouldeſt vndoo thee, and all thy parentage. And ſpeaking with the trouth, I am very ſory to ſee thee caſt away: but much more it greeueth mee, to ſee thee drowned in ſo litle a water. When men are noble, and keepe their harts high, they ought to take their enemies agreable to their eſtates. I meane, that when a noble man ſhal aduenture to hazard hys perſon, and hys goods, he ought to doo it for a matter of great importaunce. For in the end, more defamed is hee that ouercommeth a laborer, then hee which is ouercome with a knight. O how va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riable is fortune, and in how ſhort ſpace dooth happen an euill fortune? in that which now I wyll ſpeake, I doo condemne my ſelf, and accuſe thee. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne to the Gods, I reclayme the dead, and I call the lyuing, to the end they may ſee, how that before our eyes wee ſuffer the greeſes, and know them not, with the hands wee touch them, and perceue them not, wee goe ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſee them not, they ſound in our eares, and wee heare them not, dayly they doo admonyſh vs, and wee doo not beeleue them: fynally wee feele the peryl, where there is no remedy of our greefe. For as experyence dooth teach vs, with a lytell blaſt of wynde the fruit doo fall, with a lytell ſpark of fyer the houſe is kyndled, with a lytell rock the ſhipp is broken, at a lytell ſtone the foot doth ſtumble, with a lytell hook they take great fyſh, and with a lytell wound dyeth a great perſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:242"/>For all that I haue ſpoken, I meane, that our lyfe is ſo frayl and fortune ſo fykcle, that in that parte where wee are ſureſt harneſſed, wee are ſooneſt wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Seneca</hi> wrytyng to hys mother <hi>Albina,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> was baniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, ſayd.</p>
                     <p>Thou <hi>Albina</hi> art my mother and I thy ſonne, thou art aged and I am not yong, I neuer beeleued in fortune, though ſhee woold promiſe to bee in peace with mee. And further hee ſayd, al that which is in mee, I count it at the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of fortune, aſwell of ritches, as of proſperitye: and: I keep them in ſuch a place, that at any hour in the night when ſhee liſteth, ſhee may carye them away, &amp; neuer wake mee. So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> though ſhee cary thoſe out of my cofers yet ſhee ſhould not rob mee of this in my intrails. With out doubt ſuch woords were merueylous pythy, and verye decent for ſuch a wiſe man.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor <hi>Adryan</hi> my Lord, did weare a rynge of gold on his fynger which hee ſayd was of the good <hi>Druſius Germanicus,</hi> and the woord about the ring in latin letters ſayd thus. <hi>Illis eſt grauis fortuna, quibus eſt repentina.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to them is moſt cruell, whom ſodenly ſhe aſſaulteth. Wee ſee oftentimes by experience, that in the fyſtula which is ſtopped, and not in that which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, the Surgion maketh doubt. In the ſhallow water, and not in the deepe ſeas, the Pilot deſpayreth. The good man of armes is more afrayd of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create ambuſhment, then in the open battayle. I mean, that the valiant man ought to beware, not of ſtraungers, but of his owne, not of enemyes but of frends, not of the the cruel warre, but of the fayned peace, not of the manyfeſt domage, but of the pryuy perill. O how manye wee haue ſeene, whome the myſhaps of fortune coold neuer chaunge, and yet afterward hauyng no care ſhe hath made them fall. I aſk now, what hope can man haue, which wyll neuer truſt to the proſperity of fortune? Since for ſo lyght a thing, wee haue ſeene ſuch trouble in <hi>Capua,</hi> and ſo great loſſe of thy perſon and goods? If we knew fortune, wee woold not make ſo great complaynt of her.</p>
                     <p>For ſpeakynge the trouth, as ſhe is for all, and would contente all, though in the end ſhe mock all, ſhee geeueth and ſheweth vs all her goods, and wee others take them for inherytaunce. That which ſhee lendeth vs, wee take it for perpetuall, that which in ieſt ſhe geeueth vs, wee take it in good earneſt, &amp; in the end, as ſhe is the mocker of all, ſo ſhee goeth mockyng of vs, thinkynge that ſhe geeueth vs another mans, and ſhe taketh our owne proper. I let thee wete, that knowing that of fortune which I know, I fear not the turmoyles of her traueyles neyther dooth her lightnings or thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders aſtony mee, nor yet wyll I not eſteme the pleaſantnes, of her goodly fayr flatteryes. I wyll not truſt her ſweete reioyſings, neither wyll I make accompt of her frendſhyps, nor I wyll ioyne my ſelfe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her enemyes, nor I wyll take any pleaſure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhee geueth mee, neither greefe of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee taketh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, nor I wyl haue reſpect when ſhe telleth mee truth, nor I doo not regard it, though ſhe tel mee a lye.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I will not laugh for that ſhee aſketh mee, nor I wil weepe for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee ſendeth mee. I wyll now tel thee (my frend <hi>Domitiꝰ</hi>) one thing, and hartely I deſire thee to keepe it in memory. Oure, lyfe is ſo doubtfull, and fortune ſo ſodaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhee thretneth, ſhe ſtryketh not always, neyther doth ſhee threa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten alwaies when ſhee ſtryketh. The man which preſumeth to bee ſage, and in all things well prouyded, goeth not ſo faſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at euery ſteppe hee is in daunger of falling, nor ſo ſoftly, that in long tyme hee cannot aryue at his iorneys end.

                     <p>
                        <hi>MAcrobius</hi> in the third book of the Saturnalles ſaieth, that in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cyty af <hi>Athens,</hi> there was a temple called <hi>Miſericordia,</hi> which the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> kept ſo well watched, and locked, that without leaue and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Senat no man might enter in. There were the Images of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull princes onely, and none entred in there to pray but pitefull men.</p>
                     <p>The Atheniens abhorred always ſeuere and cruel deeds, beecauſe they would not bee noted cruell. And therof cometh this maner of ſaying, that the greateſt iniury they could ſay vnto a man was, that hee had neuer entred into the ſcoole of the philoſophers to learne, nor in to the temple of <hi>Miſericordia</hi> to pray. So that in the one, they noted him for ſimple: and in the other they accuſed him for cruell. The hiſtoriographers ſay that the moſt noble linage that was at that time, was of a king of Athens, the which was exceeding rych and lyberall in geeuing: and aboue all very pitifull in pardoning. Of whom it is written, that after the great treaſours which hee had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the temples, and the great riches hee had diſtributed to the poore: hee tooke vppon him to bring vp all the orphans in <hi>Athens,</hi> and to feede all the widows. O how much more did that ſtatut of the ſayd pytyfull king ſhine in that temple, who noriſhed the orphanes, then the enſignes which are ſet vp in the Temples of the captaines, which had robbed the wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. All the auncient princes, I ſay thoſe that haue beene noble and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt, and that haue not had the name of tiraunts, though in ſome things they were noted: yet they always haue been prayſed, eſtemed, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to bee gentle and mercifull: ſo that they recompenſed the fierſnes and cruelty which they ſhew to their enemies, with the mercy &amp; clemency which they vſed to the orphans. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his politikes ſayeth: that the Romayns among them ſelues ordeyned, that all that which remayned of bankettes &amp; feaſts, which were made at mariages and triumphs, ſhoold bee geeuen to wydows, and orphans. And this cuſtome was brought to ſo good an order that if any rich man would vſe his profit of that which remayned, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> orphans might iuſtly haue an accion of felony againſt him as a thing robbed from them. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> philoſopher in an oration hee made of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> excellencie of Rome
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21411:243"/>
ſayeth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes of <hi>Perſia</hi> had this cuſtom, neuer to dyne nor ſup, but firſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trumpets ſhoold blow at their gates: the w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> were more loud, then armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And it was to this end, that al the widows &amp; orphans ſhoold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e thither: for it was a law amongſt them, that all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was left at the royal tables, ſhould bee for the poore and indigent perſons. <hi>Phalaris</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyrant writing to a freend of his, ſaid theſe woords. I haue receued thy brieef letter, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rebuke likewiſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> thou gaueſt mee therin, more bitter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tedyous. And admit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time it greeued mee, yet after I came to my ſelfe, I receyued thereby great comfort. For in the end, one louing rebuke of his freend is more woorth: then a fayned flattery of his enemy. Amongſt the things wherof thou accuſeſt me, thou ſayſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they take mee for a great tiraunt, beecauſe I diſobey the gods, ſpoyl the temples, kil the prieſts, purſue the innocents, rob the people: and the woorſt of all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I doo not ſuffer mee to bee entreted, nor permit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any man be conuerſau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with mee.

For that they ſay I kil prieſts, I confes alſo that it is true.

For that they ſay I am not pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull amongſt the miſerable, &amp; will not heare the wydows, and orphans, in no wiſe to that I will agree: For I ſwear vnto thee, by the immortal gods, that my gates were neuer ſhutt to widowees, and orphans. <hi>Pulio</hi> in the life of the Emperor <hi>Claudius</hi> ſayth, that ons a poore widow came before <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dius</hi> the Emperor with weeping eies, to deſire him of iuſtice.

And as there was about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperor many noble Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, one amongſt them ſayd vnto him. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> authority &amp; grauitye of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn princes, to heare their ſubiects in iuſtice, ſuffiſeth onely: though they dry not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> teares of their faces.

For aſmuch as you ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is of ſmall aucthoryty, and alſo of leſſe grauity, that a prince doo weepe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a widowe, and with his hands wype her eyes, I aunſwer: thee that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire rather to bee partaker of the griefes with my ſubiects, then to giue them occaſion to haue theyr eyes full of teares.</p>

And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vnhappy king <hi>Darius</hi> knew the clemency and pity, which the good <hi>Alexander</hi> vſed to his wyfe, and his chyldren, hee ſent vnto him his embaſſadours, to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> on his beehalf they ſhoold thanke hym for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is paſt, and ſhoold deſire hym that hee would continew ſo in tyme to come: ſaing, that it might chaunce, that the Gods and fortune would mitigat their wrath againſt him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alexander</hi> aunſwered to the imbaſſadours theſe words, Yee ſhall ſay in my beehalf to your king <hi>Darius,</hi> that hee geeue mee no thankes for the good and piteful woork that I haue doon to his captyue weemen, ſince hee is certain I did it not for that hee was my frend: and I would not ceaſe to doo it, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee is myne enemy. But I haue doon it, for that a gentle Prince is bound to doo in ſuch a caſe. For I ought to employ my clemency to weemen, which can doo nought but weepe: &amp; my puiſſaunte power Princes ſhal feele, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> can doo nought els but wage batayle. Truly theſe woords were worthy of ſuch a prince, Many haue enuy at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſurname of <hi>Alexander,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is great.

                     <p>I doo not maruayl, that the proud princes haue enuy agaynſt the vertuous and valiant princes: but if I were as they, I would haue more enuy at the renowme of <hi>Antonius</hi> the emperor, then of the name and renowme of all the princes in the world.

                     <p>Finally I ſay, that the poore miſerable widows ſhall find a thouſand which iudge their liues, and they haue not one that wil remedy their paynes. Much loſeth the woman, who loſeth her mother which hath borne her or her ſiſters which ſhe loueth, or the fri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des which ſhee knoweth, or the goods which ſhee hath heaped vp: but I ſaye and affirme, that ther is no greater loſſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world vnto a woman, then the loſſe of a good huſband. For in other loſſes there is but one onely loſſe: but in that of the huſband, al are loſte together. After that the wife doth ſee her louing huſband in the graue, I woold aſk her what good could remayne with her in her houſe? Since wee know, that if her huſband were good, he was the haue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al her trobles, the remedy of al her neceſſitys, the inuentour of all her pleaſours, the true loue of her hart, the true lord of her parſon, and the idoll whom ſhee honored: finally he was the faithfull ſteward of her houſe, and the good father of her children and familye. Whether fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily remayneth or not, whyther children remayneth or not, in the one and in the other, trouble and vexation remaineth moſt aſſuredly to the poore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. If perchaunce ſhee remayne poore, and haue no goods, let euery man imagine what her life can bee. For the poore miſerable vnhappy woman, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wil aduenture her parſon to get, or wil loſe her honeſty to demaund. An honeſt woman, a noble &amp; worthy woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a delicat woman a ſweete woman, a woman of renowme, a woman that ought to maynteyne children, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ought to haue great reaſon to bee full of anguiſhe and ſorow: to ſee, that if ſhee wil mainteyne her ſelf w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> the needle ſhee ſhal not haue ſufficiently to find her ſelf bread and water. If ſhee gaine with her bodie ſhee loſeth her ſoule. If ſhee muſt demaund others, ſhee is ſahamed. If ſhee fulfill the teſtament of her huſband, ſhee muſt ſell her gowns If ſhee will not pay his detts, they cauſe her to be brought beefore the iudge. As women naturaly are tender, what hart will ſuffer theym to ſuffer ſuch inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces? and what eyes can abſteine to ſhed infinite tears? If perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce goods doo remaine to the miſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable widow, ſhe hath no litel care to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Shee is at great charges and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21411:245"/>
expences, to ſuſtain, and maintayn her ſelf in long ſuit about her lands, much trouble to augment them, and in the end, much ſorow to depart from them.</p>
                     <p>For all her children, and heirs, doo occupy them ſelues more to think, how they might inherit: then in what ſort they ought to ſerue her. When I came to this paſſage, a great while I kept my pen in ſuſpence, to ſee whither I ought to touch this matter or no, that is to weete, that oftentimes the poore wydows put openly the demaund of their goods: and the iudges doo ſecretly demaund the poſſeſſion of their parſon. So that firſt they doo iniury to her honor, beefore they doo miniſter iuſtice to her demaunds. Though perchance ſhee hath no child, yet therfore ſhee remaineth not without any comfort, and for that the parents of her huſband doo ſpoyl her of her goods. For in thys caſe their heirs often times are ſo diſordered, that for a worn cloke, or for a broken ſhirt, they trouble and ſore vexe the poore wydow. If perchaunce the miſerable wydow haue children, I ſay that in this caſe ſhee hath double ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. For if they are yong, ſhee endureth much payn to bring them vp: ſo that ech hour and moment, their mothers lyue in great ſorows, to think onely of the lyfe, and health of their children. If perhaps the children are old, truely the griefs whych remayn vnto them are no leſſe. For ſo much as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of them are eyther proud, diſobedient, malycious, negligent, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, gluttons, blaſphemers, falſe lyers, dull headed, wanting wit, or ſickly.</p>
                     <p>So that the ioy of the wofull mothers is to beewayl the death of their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beeloued huſbands, and to remedy the diſcords of their youthfull children. If the troubles which remain to the mothers with the ſonnes bee great: I ſay that thoſe which they haue with their doughters, bee much more. For if the doughter bee quick of witt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother thinketh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee ſhalbee vndoon. If ſhee bee ſimple, ſhee thinketh that euery man will deceiue her. If ſhee bee faier, ſhee hath enough to doo to keepe her. If ſhee bee deformed: ſhee cannot mary her. If ſhee bee well manered, ſhee wil not let her go from her. If ſhee bee euil manered, ſhee ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not endure her. If ſhee bee to ſolitary, ſhee hath not wherewith to remedy her. If ſhee bee diſſolute, ſhee wil not ſuffer her to bee puniſhed. Fynally, if ſhee put her from her, ſhee feareth ſhee ſhalbee ſclaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If ſhee leaue her in her houſe, ſhee is afrayd ſhee ſhalbee ſtollen. What ſhal the wofull poore wydow doo, ſeeing her ſelf burdened with doughters, &amp; enuironed with ſonnes, and neither of them of ſuch ſufficient age, that there is any tyme to remedy them: nor ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to maintein them? Admit that ſhee mary one of her ſonnes, and one doughter, I demaund therfore if the poore widow wil leaue her care, and anguiſh? Truely I ſay no, though ſhee chooſe rich perſonages, and wel diſpoſed, ſhee cannot eſcape, but the day that ſhee repleniſheth her ſelf with doughters in law, the ſame day ſhee chargeth her hart with ſorows, trauels, and cares. O poore wydows, deceiue not your ſelues, and doo not immagin that hauing maried your ſonnes, &amp; doughters, from that time forward yee ſhal liue more ioyful and contented. For that laid aſide, which their nephews doo demaund them, and that their ſonnes in law doo rob them: when the poore old woman thinketh to bee moſt ſureſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yong man ſhall make a claym to her goods. What doughter in law is there in this world, who faithfully loueth her ſtepmother? And what ſonne in law is there in the world, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſireth not to bee heir to his father in law? Suppoſe a poore
<pb facs="tcp:21411:246"/>
widow to bee fallen ſick, the which hath in her houſe a ſonne in law, and that a man aſk him vppon his oth, which of theſe two things hee had rather haue: either to gouern his mother in law, wyth hope to heal her: or to bury her, with hope to inherit her goods. I ſwear that ſuch woold ſwere, that hee coold reioyce more to geeue a ducket for the graue: then a penny to the phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to purge and heal her. <hi>Seneca</hi> in an epiſtle ſaith, that the fathers in law naturally loue their doughters in law, &amp; the ſonnes in law are loued of their mothers in law. And for the contrary hee ſaith, that naturally the ſonnes in law doo hate their mothers in law: But I take it not for a generall rule, for there are mothers in law whych deſerue to bee woorſhipped, and there are ſonnes in law which are not worthy to bee beeloued. Other troobles chance dayly to theſe poore wydows, which is, that when one of them hath one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſonne, whom ſhee hath in the ſteed of a huſband, in ſteed of a brother, in ſteed of a ſonne, ſhee ſhall ſee him dye: whom ſith ſhee had his lyfe in ſuch great loue, ſhee cannot though ſhee woold, take his death with pacience: So that as they bury the dead body of the innocent chyld, they bury the lyuely hart of the wofull mother. Let vs omit the ſorows whych the mothers haue when their children dye, and let vs aſk the mothers what they feele when they are ſick? They will aunſwer vs, that always and as often tymes as their children bee ſick, the death of their huſbands then is renued, imagining that it wil happen ſo vnto them, as it hath doon vnto others. And to ſay the trueth, it is not maruel yf they doo fear. For the vyne is in greater peril, when it is budded, then when the grapes are rype. Other troubles oftentymes encreaſe to the poore widows, the which amongſt others this is not the leaſt: that is to weete, the lytle regard of the frends of her huſband, and the vnthankfulnes of thoſe which haue been brought vp wyth him. The which ſince hee was layd in his graue, neuer entred into the gates of his houſe: but to demaund recompence of their old ſeruices, and to renew and beegin new ſuits. I woold haue declared (or to ſay better, breefly touched) the trauels of wydows, to perſwade princes that they remedy them, and to admoniſh iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to heare them, and to deſire all vertuous men to comfort them. For the woork of it ſelf is ſo godly, that hee deſerueth more whych remedyeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of one only: then I which write their miſeries all together.</p>

                     <head>¶Of a letter whych the Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote to a Romayn Lady named Lauinia, comforting her for the death of her huſband. Cap. xxxvii.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>MArcus</hi> of mount <hi>Celio,</hi> Emperor of Rome, cheef conſull, tribune of the people, high Biſhop, appointed againſt the <hi>Daces,</hi> wiſheth health and comfort to thee <hi>Lauinia,</hi> noble, and woorthy Romayn matron, the late wyfe of the good <hi>Claudinus.</hi> According to that thy perſon deſerueth, to that which vnto thy huſband I ought, I think well that thou wilt ſuſpect that I way thee litle: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnto thy great ſorows, complaints, &amp; lamentacions, are now aryued my negligent conſolacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. When I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber thy merits, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> can not fail, &amp; imagin that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wilt remember my good will, wherwith always I haue deſired to ſerue thee: I am aſſured, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if thy ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accuſe mee, thy vertu
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21411:246"/>
and wiſedome will defend mee. For ſpeaking the trueth, though I am y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt to comfort thee: yet I was the firſt to feele thy ſorows. As ignoraunce is the cruell ſcourge of vertues, and ſpurre to all vyces: ſo it chaunceth oft times, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ouer much knowlege, putteth wiſe men in doubt, &amp; ſclaundereth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> innocent. For aſmuch as wee ſee by experience, the moſt preſumptuous in wiſedome, are thoſe which fall into moſt perilous vices. Wee fynd the latins much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the ignoraunce of vyces: then the Greekes with the knowledge of vertues. And the reaſon hereof is, for that of things which wee are ignorant wee haue no payn to attayn vnto them: and leſſe grief alſo to loſe them. My intention to tell thee this was, becauſe I knew that, which I woold not haue known, and haue hard that, which I woold not haue hard: that is to weete, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the days and troubles of <hi>Claudinus</hi> thy huſband are ended, &amp; now thy ſorows (<hi>Lauinia</hi> his wife) doo begin. It is now a good whyle, that I haue known of the death of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good <hi>Claudinus</hi> my frend, &amp; thy huſband, though I did diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it. And by the god <hi>Mars</hi> I ſwere vnto thee, that it was not for that I woold not beewayl him, but becauſe I woold not diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort thee. For it were extreme cruelty, that ſhee w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> was ſo comfortleſſe, &amp; ſorowful, for the abſence of ſo long time: ſhoold bee killed with my hand, through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of the death of her ſo deſired huſband. It were to vnkynd &amp; vnſeemly a thing, that ſhee, of whom I haue receiued ſo many good woorks: ſhoold receiue of mee ſo euil news. The auncients of <hi>Carthage</hi> held for an inuiolable law, that if the father did tel y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of his ſonne, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne the death of the father, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of her huſband, or the huſband the death of his wife, or any other ſemblable woful, &amp; lamentable death: that hee ſhoold bee caſt into the priſon, among them w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> were condemned to dye. It ſeemed to thoſe of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that hee w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſayd vnto an other, that his brother, kinſman, or frend, was dead, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly they ſhoold kil him, or hee ought to dye, or at the leaſt hee ſhoold ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee ſeene in his preſence. If in this caſe the law of the <hi>Carthagians</hi> was iuſt: then I ought to bee excuſed, though I haue not told thee this heauy news. For as oft as wee ſee him, who hath brought vs any euill tydings: our ſorows by his ſight is renued agayn. Since <hi>Claudinus</hi> thy huſband dyed, I haue not had one hower of reſt, for to paſſe thy tyme away: for feare leſt ſuch woful &amp; ſorowful news, ſhoold come to thy knowlege. But now that I know thou knowſt it, I feele double payn. For now I feele his death, my care, and thy want of conſolation: &amp; the domage by his death ſhal folow to the romayn Empire. Thou haſt loſt a noble Romayn, valyant in blood, moderat in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perityes, pacient in aduerſities, coragious in dangers, diligent in affaires, wyſe in counſels, faithful to his frends, ſubtill &amp; ware of his enemies, a louer of the common wealth, &amp; very honeſt in his perſon: &amp; aboue all, &amp; whereof I haue moſt enuy is, that hee neuer offended man in his life, nor hurt any with his tong. Wee fynd ſeldom times, ſo many vertues aſſembled in one man.</p>
                     <p>For ſaying the trueth, if a man did narowly examin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vyces of many, which preſume to bee very vertuous: I ſwere that hee ſhoold fynd more to reproue, then to praiſe. Since y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt loſt ſo good a huſband, &amp; I ſo faithful a frend: wee are bound, thou to beewayl ſo great a loſſe, &amp; I to ſigh for ſo good a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion. And this I doo not deſire for <hi>Claudine,</hi> who now reſteth among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods: but for vs others, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> remayn in danger of ſo many euils. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dead doo reſt, as
<pb facs="tcp:21411:247"/>
in the ſure hauen: &amp; wee others doo ſaile, as yet in raging ſea. O thou heauy hart, how doo I ſee thee, beetweene the bell &amp; the clappers, that is to weete, that thou wanteſt the company of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good: &amp; art enuironed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the flock of euil. For the w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> occaſion, I doubt often times, whether I may firſt bewaill the euil which liue: or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> are dead, beecauſe in the end y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euill men doo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs more, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> wee fynd: then dooth the good men which wee loſe. It is a great pity, to ſee the good &amp; vertuous men dye: but I take it to bee more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to ſee the euill &amp; vicious men liue. As the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, the gods to kill the good w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſerue them, &amp; to geeue long life to the euill w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> offend them, is a miſtery ſo profound, that dayly wee doo lament it, and yet wee can neuer attayn to the ſecrets therof. Tell mee I pray thee <hi>Lauinia,</hi> knowſt thou not now, that the gods are ſo merciful, with whom wee go when wee dye, &amp; that men are ſo wicked, with whom wee bee whiles wee liue: that as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euill were born to dye, ſo the good dye to lyue? for the good man though hee dye, lyueth: &amp; the euill man though hee liue, dyeth. I ſwear vnto thee by the mother <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthia,</hi> and ſo the god <hi>Iupiter</hi> doo preſerue mee, that I ſpeak not this which I will ſpeak fainedly: which is, that conſidering the reaſt that the dead haue with the gods, and ſeeing the ſorows &amp; troubles wee haue here with the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: I ſay, and affirm once agayn, that they haue greater compaſſion of our lyfe, then wee others haue ſorow of their death. Though the death of men were as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of beaſts, that is to weet, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were no furies, nor deuils, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſhoold torment the euil, &amp; that the gods ſhoold not reward y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good: yet wee ought to bee comforted, to ſee our frends dye, if it were for no other, but to ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deliuered from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thraldo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this miſerable world. The pleaſure y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot hath to bee in ſure hauen, the glory y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the captaine hath to ſee the day of victory, the reſt that the traueler hath to ſee his iorney ended, the contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the woork man hath to ſee his woork come to perfeccion, all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame haue the dead, ſeeing them ſelues out of this miſerable lyfe. If men were born alway to lyue, it were reaſon to lament them, when wee ſee them dye: but ſince it is troth that they are borne to dye, I woold ſay, ſince needes dye wee muſt, that wee ought not to lament thoſe whych dye quickly, but thoſe whych lyue long. I am aſſured, that <hi>Claudine</hi> thy huſband, remembring that whych in this lyfe hee hath paſſed, and ſuffered, and ſeeing the reſt that hee hath in the other: though the Gods woold make him emperor of Rome, hee woold not bee one day out of his graue. For returning to the world, hee ſhoold dye agayn: but beeing with the gods, hee hopeth to lyue perpetually. Lady <hi>Lauinia,</hi> moſt earneſtly I deſire thee, ſo vehemently not to perſe the heauens with thy ſo heauy ſighes, ne yet to wete the earth, with thy ſo bitter teares: ſince thou knowſt, that <hi>Claudine</hi> thy huſband is in place, where there is no ſorow, but mirth, where ther is no payn, but reſt: where hee weepeth not, but laugheth, where hee ſigheth not, but ſingeth, where hee hath no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, but pleaſures, where hee feareth not cruell death, but enioyeth perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall lyfe. Since therfore this is true, it is but reaſon the wydow appeaſe her anguiſh, conſidering that her huſband endureth no payn.</p>
                     <p>Often tymes wyth my ſelf I haue thought, what the widows ought to immagin, when they ſee them ſelues in ſuch cares and diſtreſſe.</p>
                     <p>And after my count made, I fynd that they ought not to thynk of the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21411:247"/>
company paſt, nor wofull ſolitarynes wherin they are preſently, and much leſſe they ought to think on the pleaſures of this world: but rather to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the reſt in the world to come. For the true widow ought to haue her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſacion among the lyuing, and her deſire to bee wyth the dead. If til this preſent thou hadſt paine, and trouble, to look for thy huſband to come home: haue thou now ioy, that hee looketh for thee in heauen, wherin I ſwere vnto thee, that there thou ſhalt bee better vſed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods, then hee was here of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For in this world wee know not what glory meaneth, and there they know not what payns are. <hi>Licinius</hi> and <hi>Poſthumius</hi> thy vncles, told mee that thou art ſo ſorowful, that thou wilt receiue no comfort: but in this caſe I think not, that thou bewaileſt ſo much for <hi>Claudinus,</hi> that thou alone dooſt think y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt loſt him. For ſince wee did reioyce togethers in his lyfe: wee are bound to weep togethers at his death. The heauy and ſorowful harts, in this world feele no greater greef: then to ſee others reioice at theyr ſorows. And the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hereof is, that the wofull and afflicted hart feeleth no greater ioy, nor reſt in extreme miſhaps of fortune, then to think that others haue ſorow and greef of their payn. When I am heauy and comfortles, I greatly ioy to haue my frend by mee: and my hart dooth tell mee, that what I feele, hee feeleth: So that all which my frend with his eyes dooth beewail, and all that which of my greefes hee feeleth, the more therwith hee burdeneth him ſelf, and the more therof hee diſchargeth mee. The Emperor <hi>Octauian Auguſtus</hi> (the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories ſay) on the riuer of <hi>Danuby,</hi> found a kynd of people which had thys ſtraunge cuſtom, that with eyes was neuer ſeene, nor in books at any time euer read, which was: that two frends aſſembled, and went to the aultars of the temples, and there one frend confederat with an other: ſo that their harts were maried, as man and wife are maried touching their bodies, ſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and promyſing there to the gods, neuer to weepe, nor to take ſorow, for any miſhap that ſhoold come to their perſons. So that my frend ſhoold come to lament, and remedy my troubles, as if they had been his own: &amp; I ſhoold lament, and remedy his, as if they had been mine. O glorious world, O age moſt happy, O people of eternal memory, wherin men are ſo gentle, &amp; frendz ſo faithfull: that their own trauails they forgot, and the ſorows of ſtrangers they beewayled. O Rome without rome, O tyme euil ſpent, O lyfe to vs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers euil emploied, O wretch that always art careles, now adays y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack and intrailes are ſo ſeuered from the good, and the harts ſo ioyned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the euill: that men forgetting them ſelues to bee men, beecome more cruell then wyld beaſts. I labor to geeue thee lyfe: and thou ſeekeſt to procure my death. Thou weepeſt to ſee mee laugh: and I laugh to ſee thee weepe. I procure that thou doo not mount: and thou ſeekeſt that I might fall. Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally without the profit of any, wee caſt our ſelues away: and wythout gayn, wee doo reioyce to end our lyues. By the faith of a good man I ſwear vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee (Lady <hi>Lauinia</hi>) that if thy remedy were in my hands, as thy grief is in my hart: I woold not bee ſory for thy ſorows, neither thou ſo torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted for the death of thy huſband. But alas, though I miſerable man haue the hart to feele thy anguyſh: yet I want power to remedy thy ſorows.</p>

                     <p>SInce thy remedy, and my deſire cannot bee accompliſhed, beecauſe it is a thing vnpoſſible to receiue, and ſpeak with the dead: and not hauing power, mee think that thou and I ſhoold referre it to the gods, who can geeue much better then wee can aſk. O lady <hi>Lauinia,</hi> I deſire thee earneſtly, and as a frend I counſel and admoniſh thee, and with all my hart I require thee, that thou eſteem that for wel doon, which the gods haue doon, that thou conform thy ſelf to the will of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods, and that thou will nought els, but as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods will. For they only know they erre not, wherfore they haue aſſaulted thy huſband with ſo ſodein death: and to thee his wife, haue lent ſo long lyfe. The gods beeing as they are, ſo mighty, and ſo ſage, what is hee that can bee iudge of their profound iugements. The gods know right well thoſe which ſerue them, and thoſe which offend them: thoſe that loue them, and thoſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> hate them: thoſe that praiſe them, and thoſe that blaſpheme them: thoſe that yeeld them thanks, and thoſe which are vnthankfull. And I tel thee further, that oftentimes the gods are ſerued more with them which are buried in the graues: then with thoſe which go weeping through the temples. Wilt thou now enter into account w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gods? thou oughtſt to note &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, that they haue left thee childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to comfort thy ſelf, they haue left thee goods wherwith thou maiſt auoid pouertie, they haue left thee frends by whom thou ſhalt bee fauored, they haue left thee parentz of whom thou art beeloued, they haue left thee a good name for to bee eſteemed, and health wherwith thou mayſt liue: Fynally I ſay, that ſmall is that which the gods take from vs, in reſpect of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they leaue vs. After one ſort wee ought to beehaue our ſelues with men, and after an other wee ought to ſerue the gods. For to men ſome times it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, to ſhewe a countenaunce for to humble them: but to the gods it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to lye flat on the ground with thy ſtomack to honor them. And if the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> doo not deceiue vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods are ſooner w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> humility (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with wee woorſhip them) appeaſed: then with preſumptuous ſacrifices (w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> wee offer vnto them) contented. Since thou art wydow (Lady <hi>Lauinia</hi>) and art a wiſe and vertuous woman, beeſech the gods to preſerue thy children, to defend thy renowm, and not to ſeuer thy frends from thee, and that thou ſcatter not thy goods, to preſerue thy perſon in health, and aboue all, to bee in their, fauour. Thou canſt not winne, nor loſe ſomuch in all thy lyfe: as the gods can geeue, or take from thee in one hower. Woold to god the wydow knew, how little ſhee winneth among men, and how much ſhee loſeth amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Gods, when ſhee is not pacient in aduerſitie: for impacience oftentymes, prouoketh the gods to wrath. Wee ſee it in mans body by experience, that there are ſundrye dyſeaſes, which are not cured with woords ſpoken: but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the herbs thereunto applyed. And in other diſeaſes the contrary is ſeene, which are not cured with coſtly medicynes: but wyth comfortable woords.</p>
                     <p>The end of this compariſon tendeth to this effect, that all the afflicted harts
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21411:248"/>
ſhoold know, that ſometymes the hart is more comforted with one benefyte which they doo: then with a hundred woords which they ſpeak. And at an other tyme, the ſorowfull hart is better lyghtned, with one woord of his frends mouth: then with all the ſeruice of others in the world. O wretch that I am, for as in the one, and in the other I am deſtitut: So in all I doo want. For conſidering thy greatnes, and waying my lytle knowledge, I ſee my ſelf very vnable. For that to comfort thee, I want ſcience: and for to help thee I neede ryches. But I ceaſe not to haue great ſorow, if ſorow in paiment may bee receiued. That w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> with my perſon I can doo, neither with paper or ynk I wil requite. For the man w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> with woord only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forteth (in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beeing able to remedy) declareth him ſelf to haue been a fayned frend in tymes paſt: and ſheweth that a man ought not to take him for a faithful frend in tyme to come. That which the Romains with the wydows of Rome haue accuſtomed to doo, I will not preſently doo with thee (Lady <hi>Lauinia</hi>) that is to weete: that thy huſband beeing dead, all go to viſite the widow, all comfort the wydow, and all weepe with the wydow: and within a few days after, if the wofull wydow haue neede of any ſmall fauor with the Senat, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them ſelues togeether, as if they had neuer knowen her huſband, nor ſeene her. The renowm of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romayn wydows, is very daynty: for of their honeſty, or diſhoneſty, dependeth the good renowm of their perſon, the honor of their parents, the credit of their children, and the memory of the dead. For this therfore, it is healthfull counſayl, for wyſe men to ſpeak few woords to wydows, and to doo infinite good woorks. What auayleth it woful wydows, to haue their coffers fylled with letters and promyſes, and their eares ſtuffed wyth woords, and flatteries? If hitherto thou haſt taken mee for thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and parent of thy huſband, I beeſeech thee henceforth that thou take mee for a huſband in loue, for father in counſell, for brother in ſeruyce, and for aduocat in the Senat. And all this ſo truely ſhal bee accompliſhed, that I hope thou wilt ſay: that which in many I haue loſt, in <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> alone I haue found. I know well (as thou dooſt in lyke maner) that when the harts with ſorows are ouer whelmed, the ſpirits are troubled, the memory is dulled, the fleſh dooth tremble, the ſpirit dooth chaunge, and reaſon is withdrawn. And ſince that preſently ſorrow and care, in thy houſe doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn: let the gods forſake mee, if I abandone thee, let them forget mee, if I remember thee not. But as <hi>Claudine</hi> remayned thyne, wholly till the hour of death: ſo <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> will euermore bee thyne, duryng his lyfe.</p>
                     <p>Since I loue thee ſo intierly, and thou truſteſt mee ſo faithfully, and that thou with ſorrows art ſo repleniſhed, and my hart with care ſo oppreſſed: let vs admit, that thou Lady <hi>Lauinia,</hi> haſt the auctority to commaund mee in thy affayrs, and I lycence to counſell and aduertyſe thee of thyngs, touching thy honor, and perſon. For often tymes the wydows haue more neede of a mean remedy, then of a good counſell: I earneſtly deſyre thee to leaue the lamentacion of the Romayn wydows, that is to weete: to ſhutt the gates to tear their hears, to cutt their garments, to go bare legged, to paynt the vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, to eat ſolitarily, to weepe on the graues, to chyd her Chamberlayns, to poure out water wyth tears, to put Acorns on the graues, and to byte theyr nayls wyth the teeth: For theſe thyngs, and ſuch other ſemblable
<pb facs="tcp:21411:249"/>
lightnes, beehoueth not the grauitie of Romayn Matrons, eyther to ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or els to know them. Since there is no extremity but therunto vice is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed: I let thee weete (lady <hi>Lauinia</hi>) if thou bee ignoraunt thereof, that the widows which are ſo extreme, doo torment them ſelfes, doo trouble their frends, doo offend the gods, doo forſake theirs, and in the end they profit not the dead: &amp; to the enuious people, they geeue occaſion to talk. I woold think and mee ſeemeth, that the women which are matrons, and widows, ought to take vppon them ſuch garment, and eſtate, the day that the gods take lyfe from their huſbands: as they entend to wear during their lyfe. What auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it that a wydow bee one moneth ſhut vp in her houſe, &amp; that afterwards within a yere ſhee is met in euery place of Rome? what auaileth it, that for few days ſhee hydeth her ſelf from her parents, and frends: and afterwards ſhee is found the firſt at the theaters? what profiteth it, that widows at the firſt doo morne, and go euil attired: and afterwards they diſpute, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain of the beauty of the romayn wiues? what forceth it, that widows for a certein tyme doo keepe their gates ſhutt: and afterwards their houſen are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented then others? What ſkilleth it, that a man ſee the widows weep much for their huſbands, and afterwards they ſee them laugh more for their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes? Fynally I ſay, that it lytle auaileth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman, to ſeeme to ſuffer much openly for the death of her huſband: if ſecretly ſhee hath an other huſband all ready found? For the vertuous, and honeſt wydow, immediatly as ſhee ſeeth an other man alyue: ſhee renueth her ſorow for her huſband that is dead. I will ſhew thee (Lady <hi>Lauinia</hi>) a thing that beefell in Rome, to the end thou think not I talk at pleaſure. In the old time, in Rome ther was a noble and woorthy Romayn Lady, wife of the noble <hi>Marcus Marcellus,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Fuluia.</hi> And it happened ſo, that this woman ſeeing her huſband bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in the field of <hi>Mars,</hi> for the great greef ſhee had, ſhee ſcratched her face, ſhee ruffled her hear, ſhee tore her gown, and fell down to the earth in a found, by the reaſon wherof two Senators kept her in their arms, to thend ſhee ſhoold torment her ſelf no more. To whom <hi>Gneus Flauius</hi> the Cenſour ſaid. Let <hi>Fuluia</hi> go out of your hands, ſhee will this day doo all the penaunce of wydows. Speaking the trueth, I know not, whether this Romain ſpake with the Oracle, or that hee were a deuine: but I am aſſured that al hee ſpake came to paſſe. For that this <hi>Fuluia</hi> was the wyfe of ſo excellent a Romayn, as the good <hi>Marcus Marcellus</hi> was: I woold that ſo vnlucky a chaunce had not happened vnto her, which was: that whyles the bones of her huſband were a burning, ſhee agreed to bee maried to an other: and which was more, to one of the Senators that lyfted her vp by the armes, ſhee gaue her hand, as a Romayn to a Romayn, in token of a faithfull mariage. The caſe was ſo abhominable, that of all men it was diſpraiſed that were preſent: and gaue occaſion that they neuer credit wydows afterwards. I doo not ſpeak it (La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Lauinia</hi>) for that I think thou wilt doo ſo. For by the faith of a good man, I ſwere vnto thee, that my hart neyther ſuſpecteth it, nor yet the auctority of ſo graue a Romayn dooth demaund it: for to thee onely y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault ſhoold remain, and to mee the wonder. Hartely I commend vnto thee thy honeſty, whych to thy ſelf thou oughteſt, and the care whych beehoueth ſo woorthy and noble a wydow. For if thou art tormented, wyth the abſence of the dead: thou
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21411:249"/>
oughtſt to comfort thee, with the reputacion of the lyuing. At this preſent I will ſay no more to thee, but that thy renowm among the preſent bee ſuch, and that they ſpeak of thee ſo in abſence: that to the euill, thou geeue the bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell to bee ſilent, and to the good, ſpurres to come and ſerue thee. For the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of euill renowm, ought to bee buried quick. Other things to write to thee I haue none. Secrete matters are daungerous to truſt, conſidering that thy hart is not preſently diſpoſed to here news. It is reaſon thou know that I with thy parents and frends haue ſpoken to the Senat, which haue geeuen the office that thy huſband had in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to thy ſonne. And truely thou oughtſt no leſſe to reioyce of that, whych they haue ſayd of thee: then for that they haue geeuen him. For they ſay, though thy huſband had neuer been citizen of Rome: yet they ought to haue geeuen more then thys, onely for thy honeſt beehauiour. My wyfe <hi>Fauſtine</hi> ſaluteth thee, and I will ſay I neuer ſaw her weepe for any thing in the world ſo much, as ſhee hath wept for thy miſhap. For ſhee felt thy loſſe, which was very great: and my ſorow, whych was not lytle. I ſend thee .iiii. thouſand ſexterces in money, ſuppoſing that thou haſt wherewith to occupy them, as well for thy neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, as to diſcharge thy debts. For the complaints, demaunds, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, which they miniſter to the Romayn matrons are greater: then are the goods that their huſbands doo leue them. The gods which haue geeuen reſt to thy huſband O <hi>Claudine,</hi> geeue alſo comfort to thee his wyfe <hi>Lauinia, Marcus</hi> of mount <hi>Celio,</hi> wyth his own hand.</p>

The philoſopher <hi>Thales</hi> ſayd, that there was no more but one world: and to the contrary, <hi>Methrodorus</hi> the aſtronomer affirmed, there were infinit worlds. <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſayd, that the world was euerlaſting. <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> ſayd, that it was not true: but that it had an end. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeemed to ſay that the world was eternall.

In ſuch and other vayn queſtions, and ſpeculations, the auncient philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers conſumed many yeres. They in writing many books haue troubled their ſpirits, conſumed long tyme, trauayled many countreys, and ſuffred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable daungers: and in the end they haue ſet foorth few trueths, and many lyes. For the leaſt part of that they knew not, was much greater: then all that which they euer knew. When I took my penne in my hand to write the vanity of the world: my entention was not, to reprooue this materiall world, the which of the fower elements is compounded. That is to weete, of the earth that is cold and dry: of the water that is moyſt and cold: of the ayre, that is whot and moyſt: of fyre that is dry and whot: So that taking the world in this ſort, there is no reaſon why wee ſhoold complayn and lament of it, ſince that without him wee cannot lyue corporally. When the paynter of the world came into the world, it is not to bee beeleeued that hee repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the water which bare hym, when hee went vppon it: nor the ayre that ceaſed to blow in the ſea, nor the earth that trembled at his death, nor the light which ſeaſed to lyght, nor the ſtones which brake in ſonder, nor the fiſh whych ſuffred them ſelues to bee taken, nor the trees which ſuffered them ſelues to bee drye, nor the monuments that ſuffered them ſelues to bee ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For the creature knowledged in his creator omnipotency, and the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor founded in the creature due obedience. Oftentymes and of many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wee heere ſay, o wofull world, o miſerable world, o ſubtyl world, o world vnſtable and vnconſtant. And therfore it is reaſon wee know what the world is, whereof the world is, from whence this world is, wherof this world is made, and who is lord of thys world: ſince in it all things are vnſtable, all things are miſerable, all diſceitfull, and all things are malicious which can not bee vnderſtanded of this materiall world. For in the fyre, in the ayre, in the earth, and in the water, in the lyght, in the planets, in the ſtones, and in the trees, there are no ſorows, there are no miſeries, there are no diſceit, nor yet any malyce. The world wherein wee are born, where wee lyue, &amp; where wee dye, differeth much from the world, wherof wee doo complayn: for the world agaynſt whom wee fight, ſuffreth vs not to bee in quiet one hour in the day. To declare therfore my entencion, this wicked world is no other thing, but the euill lyfe of the worldlings, where the earth is the deſire, the fire the couetice, the water the inconſtancy, the ayre the folly, the ſtones are the pride, the flowers of the trees the thoughts, the deepe ſea the hart. Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally I ſay, that the ſonne of this world, is the proſperity: and the moone is the continuall chaunge. The prince of this ſo euill a world is the deuill, of whom Ieſus Chriſt ſayd. The prince of this world ſhall now bee caſt out: and thys the redeemer of the world ſayeth. For hee called the worldlings and their worldly lyues the world. For ſince they bee ſeruaunts of ſinne, of neceſſity they muſt bee ſubiects of the deuyll. The pryde, the auaryce, the enuy, the blaſphemy, the pleaſures, the lechery, the neglygence, the glottony, the yre, the malyce, the vanity, and the folly.</p>
                     <p>This is the world agaynſt whych wee fight al our lyfe, and where the good are princes of vyces, and the vyces are lords of the vicious.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:21411:250"/>Let vs compare the trauels which wee ſuffer of the elements, wyth thoſe whych wee endure of the vyces, and wee ſhall ſee, that lyttle is the perill wee haue on the ſea, and the land, in reſpect of that which encreaſeth of our euyll lyfe. Is not hee in more daunger, that falleth through malyce into pryde: then hee which by chaunce falleth from a high rock? Is not hee who wyth enuy is perſecuted, in more daunger: than hee that with a ſtone is wounded? Are not they in more perill, that liue among vicious men: than others that liue among bruit and cruell beaſts? Doo not thoſe which are tormented w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fire of couetouſnes ſuffer greater daunger, then thoſe which lyue vnder the mount <hi>Ethna?</hi> Fynally I ſay, that they bee in greater perils, whych w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hygh immaginations are blynded: then the trees which with the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat wyndes are ſhaken. And afterwards this world is our cruell enemy, it is a deceitfull frend, it is that which always keepeth vs in trauell, it is that which taketh from vs our reſt, it is that that robbeth vs of our treaſor, it is that which maketh him ſelf to bee feared of the good, &amp; that which is greatly beeloued of the euill. It is that which of the goods of other is prodigall, and of his own very miſerable. Hee is the inuenter of all vyces, and the ſcourge of all vertues. It is hee which entertaineth al his in flattery and fair ſpeech. This is hee which bringeth men to diſſention, that robbeth the renowm of thoſe that bee dead, and putteth to ſack the good name of thoſe that bee aliue. Fynally I ſay, that this curſed world is hee, which to all ought to render ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, and of whom none dare aſk accompt. O vanity of vanity, where all walk in vanity, where all think vanity, where all cleue to vanity, where all ſeemeth vanity: and yet this is lyttle to ſeeme vanity, but that in dede it is vanity. For as falſe witnes ſhoold hee bere, that woold ſay that in this world ther is any thing aſſured, healthfull, and true: as hee that woold ſay that in heauen there is any vnconſtant, variable, or falſe thing. Let therfore vayn princes ſee, how vayn their thoughts bee, and let vs deſire a vayn prince to tell vs how hee hath gouerned him wyth the vanities of the world. For if hee beeleeue not that whych my penne wryteth, let him beeleeue that whych hys parſon prooueth. The woords written in the book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> are ſuch.</p>

O princes, and great lords, I beeſech yee, and in the name of Ieſus chriſt I exhort you, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to enter into this deepe ſeas: ſince thys

order is ſo diſordered, that it bringeth all diſorders, &amp; euil cuſtoms. For al thoſe which ſhall trauail by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, when they ſhal think to goe moſt ſure in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midſt of their iourney, they ſhal finde them ſelues to bee loſt. None ought to agree with the world, for that hee might liue ſure in his houſe: for day &amp; night, to all worldlings hee hath his gate open, making their entry large &amp; ſure. But let vs beeware wee enter not, and much more that wee lode not our ſelues with his vices, and bee delighted with his pleaſures. For ſince wee doo waxe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, and that wee are entered therein, though wee doo repent, by no way wee fynd the ſure comming out, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt wee muſt wel pay for our lodging. I maruell not though the worldlings at euery moment bee deceiued, ſins ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyciouſly they beehold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their eies, &amp; loue it profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their harts. But if they deſyred as profoundly to conſider it, as they do vaynly follow it, they ſhoold ſee very plain that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world did not flatter them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> proſperity, but threaten them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> aduerſity. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnder the greateſt point of the dye, which is the vi. is hyd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt which is the aſe, I woold counſel princes, &amp; great lordes, that they woold not beeleeue the world nor his flatteries, and much leſſe bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them ſelues nor their vayn ymaginacions. The which for the moſt part doo think that after they haue trauailed and heaped vp great treaſure, they ſhall enioy but their own trauail, without the trouble of any man, or that any man doo goe again them. O how vayn is ſuch thought, and how oft dooth it chaunge contrary. The world is of ſuch an euill condicion, that if hee let vs reſt our firſt ſleepe, as well vs, as that which wee haue gotten, immediatly in the morning, yea oftentimes an hower from thence, hee waketh vs w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a new care, &amp; now hee hath prepared for vs ſome mean, to occupy our ſelues about ſome other trouble.</p>

                     <p>THemperor <hi>Traian</hi> ſayd one day to his maiſter (which was <hi>Plutarche</hi> the great phyloſopher) tell mee maſter, why there are commonly moe euill then good? and why without compariſon there are mo which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vices, than thoſe which embrace vertue?

And know thou, if thou knowſt it not (moſt noble Prince) that all thys e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill proceedeth, that men doo follow men, and that they ſuffer not reaſon to follow reaſon.

                        </gap>y, that for all our trauailes wee may fynd remedy in it, which ſeemeth to bee true. For ſo much as if the ſunne dooth annoy vs, wee doo retire to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. If wee are greeued goyng on foot, wee doo remedy it goyng on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. If the ſea bee daungerous, wee ſaile w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhyps, If the cold doo vexe vs, wee approch neere the fyer. If thurſt dooth trouble vs, wee doo quench it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> drink, If rayn dooth wet vs, wee go into houſes. If the plague bee in one pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, wee fly into another. If wee haue enemies, wee comfort our ſelues wyth our frends. Fynally I ſay, that there is no ſorow, nor trauaile, but that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:252"/>
hath found ſome reſt &amp; remedy. This preſuppoſed to bee true (as it is trouth in deede) now I aſk all the worldlings, if they haue found any remedy againſt the troubles &amp; diſceits of this world? If I bee not deceiued, &amp; if I vnderſtand any thing of this world, the remedy which the world geeueth for the troubles, certainly are greater trauailes, then the trauailes them ſelues: ſo that they are ſalues that doo not heal our wounds, but rather burn our fleſh. When the diſeaſes are not very old rooted, nor daungerous, it profiteth more oftentimes to abide a gentle feauer: then to take a ſharp purgacion. I mean, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world is ſuch a deceyuer, and ſo double, that hee dooth contrary to that hee puniſheth. That is to weete, that if hee doo perſwade vs to reuenge an iniury: it is to the end that in reuenging that one, wee ſhoold receiue a thouſand inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And where as wee think it taketh from vs, it encreaſeth infynite. So that this curſed guide, making vs to beeleeue it leadeth vs vpon the dry land among our frends: cauſeth vs to fall into the imbuſhment of our enemies. Princes and great lords, in the thoughts they haue, and in the woords that they ſpeak, are greatly eſteemed: and afterwards in the woorks which they doo, and in the affaires they trauaile, are as litle regarded. The contrary of all this dooth the wicked world, who with al thoſe hee companieth, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes hee is very gentle: &amp; afterwards in his deedes, hee is very proud. For ſpeakyng the trouth, it coſteth vs deare: and wee others doo ſell it good chepe. I ſay much, in ſaying that wee ſell it good chepe: but in manner I ſhoold ſay better, that wee geeue it willingly. For few are thoſe in number which cary away wages of the world: and infinite are thoſe, which doo ſerue it onely for a vayn hope. O princes, and great lords, I counſaile and require you, that you doo not truſt the world, neither in word, deede, nor promiſe, though hee ſweare and ſweare agayn, that hee will keepe all hee hath promiſed with you. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the world dooth honor you much, flatter you much, viſit you oft, offer you great treaſures, and geeue you much: yet it is not beecauſe hee wil geeue it yee by lytle &amp; lytle, but that afterwards hee might take it all from yee again in one day. For it is the old cuſtome of the world, that thoſe whych aboue all men hee hath ſet beefore: now at a turn, they are furdeſt beehinde. What may wee haue in the world and in his flatteries, ſince wee doo know, that one day wee ſhall ſee our ſelues depryued thereof? and that which is more, hee vſeth ſuch craft and ſubtilty with the one and the other, that in old men whom reaſon woold ſhoold not bee vicious, hee (the more to torment their parſons) hath kyndled a greater fyer in their harts, ſo that this malicious world putteth into old ryches, a new couetouſneſſe: and in the aged, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth cruell auaryce, and that in that tyme, when it is out of tyme. Wee ought greatly to conſyder, how by the world wee are deceyued: but much more wee ought to heede, that wee bee not by it diſtroyed. For where as wee thynk to bee in open lyberty: hee keepeth vs ſecret in pryſon. Wee thynk wee are whole, and hee geeueth vs ſickneſſe. Wee thynk wee haue all things: yet wee haue nothing. Wee thynk that for many yeares long ſhalbee our life, when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at euery corner wee are aſſaulted of death. Wee think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it counteth vs for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bee wiſe, when hee keepeth vs bond like vnto fooles. We think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it encreaſeth our good, when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in deede it burdeneth our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciens. Fynally I ſay, that by the way where wee thynk to contynue our renowme,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21411:252"/>
and life: wee loſe without recouery, both lyfe and fame. O filthy world, that when thou dooſt receiue vs, thou dooſt caſt vs of: when thou dooſt aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble vs, thou dooſt ſeperat vs: when thou ſeemeſt to reioice vs, thou makeſt vs ſad: when y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> pleaſeſt vs: how thou diſpleaſeſt vs: when thou exalteſt vs, how thou hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bleſt vs: &amp; when thou dooſt chaſtice vs, how thou reioiceſt. Fynally I ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou haſt thy drynks ſo impoyſoned, that wee are without thee, with thee, and hauyng the theefe within the houſe, wee goe out of the dores to ſeeke hym. Though men bee diuers in geſtures: yet much more are they variable in their appetites. And ſith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world hath experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſo many years, it hath appetites prepared for all kynd of people. For the preſumptuous hee procureth honors, to the auaricious hee procureth riches, and to thoſe which are gluttons, hee preſenteth dyuers meats. The fleſhly hee blindeth with women, and the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent hee letteth reſt: and the end why hee dooth all theſe things, is that after hee hath fed them as fyſh, hee caſteth vpon them the nettes of all vices. Note princes, and great lords, note noble men, though a prince doo ſee him ſelf lord of all the world, hee ought to thynk that of no value is the ſeignory, onles hee him ſelf bee vertuous. For litle it profiteth that hee bee lord of the vicious: which is him ſelf the ſeruant of all vices. Many ſay that the world dooth bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile them: and other ſay that they haue no power againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee may aunſwere. That if at the firſt temptacions wee woold haue reſiſted the world: it is vnpoſſible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo oftentimes it durſt aſſault vs. For of our ſmall reſiſtaunce, commeth his ſo great audacity. I can not tell if I ſhall diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I ſhal hold my peace, or whither I ſhal ſay that I woold ſay, ſince it gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth my hart ſo much, onely to think of it. For I feele my eyes redyer to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, then my fingers able to write it. It is ſo, that euery man ſuffereth him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf to bee gouerned ſo of the world: as if god were not in heauen, &amp; hee had not promiſed to bee a good chriſtian here in earth. For all that hee will, wee will, that which hee followeth, wee follow, and that which hee chooſeth wee chooſe. And that which is greateſt ſorow of all, if wee doo refrayn our ſelues from aduerſity, it is not for that of our own nature wee woold ceaſe from it: but beecauſe the world will not commaund vs to doo it. Litle is that which I haue ſpoken, in reſpect of that I will ſpeak: which is, that the world hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de vs now ſo ready to his law, that from one hower to another, it chaungeth the whole ſtate of this life. So that to day hee maketh vs hate that, which yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday wee loued, he maketh vs complayn of that, which wee commended: hee maketh vs to bee offended now with that, which beefore wee did deſire: hee maketh vs to haue mortall enemies of thoſe, which before were our ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall frends. Fynally I ſay, that the world maketh vs to loue that in our lyfe, which afterwards wee beewaile at the hower of death. If the world did gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue vnto his minyons, any perfect and accompliſhed thing: it were ſomewhat that for a time a man ſhould remayn in the ſeruice of his houſe: But ſince that in the world all things are graunted not during life, but as lendyng, whych ought to bee rendered the day following: I know not what man is ſo very a foole, that in the world dooth hope for any perpetuall thyng? For all that hee geeueth, hee geeueth with ſuch condicion, that they ſhall render it vnto him when hee ſhall demaund it: and not at the dyſcrecion of him that dooth poſſeſſe it. Peraduenture y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world can geeue vs perpetual life? I ſay certainly
<pb facs="tcp:21411:253"/>
no. For in the ſweeteſt tyme of all our lyfe, then ſodainly wee are aſſaulted of cruell death. Peraduenture the world can geeue vs temporall goods in abundaunce? I ſay certaynly no. For no man at any tyme had ſo much ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: but that whych hee wanted was more, then that hee poſſeſſed.</p>
                     <p>Peraduenture the world can geeue vs perpetual ioy? I ſay certaynly no.</p>
                     <p>For exemptyng thoſe days whych wee haue to lament, and allſo the hours whych wee haue to ſygh: there remayneth not for vs one moment to laugh. Peraduenture hee can geeue vs perpetuall health? I ſay certaynly no. For to men of long lyfe, without compariſon the diſeaſes are more which they ſuffer: then the years are whych they lyue. Peraduenture the world can gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue vs perpetuall reſt? I ſay certaynly no. For if the days bee few, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee ſee the elements without clouds: fewer are the howers, whych wee feale our harts without cares. Therefore ſynce that in this myſerable world there is no health perpetuall, nor lyfe perpetuall, nor ryches perpetuall, nor ioy perpetuall, I woold know what it is that the worldlyngs woold of the world, ſynce they know that it hath no good thing to geeue them, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by lendyng, or by vſury? If it bee vſury, there is no gayn of money: but rather retourn, with reſtitucion of vices. O children of vanyty, O maiſters of lyghtnes, ſynce it is ſo, that yee now determyne to follow and ſerue the world: looke not of the world to haue any thyng, but thyngs of the world. In it is nothyng but pryde, enuy, leachery, hate, yre, blaſphemy, auaryce, and folly. And if yee aſk yf hee haue in hys gouernaunce any vertuous thyng, hee will aunſwer you that hee dooth neuer ſell ſuch marchaundyſe in hys ſhop. Let no man thynk that the world can geeue vs that, whych it hath not for it ſelf. And if wee will chaunge any thyng with it, and it with vs: hee is ſo ſubtil to ſel, &amp; ſo curious to buy, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that which hee taketh ſhalbee of great meaſure, and that which hee ſelleth vs, ſhal want much weight.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>MArcus</hi> Emperour of Rome companion in the empyre, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hys brother <hi>Annius Verus,</hi> to thee <hi>Torquatus</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> city of <hi>Gayetta</hi> wiſheth health to thy parſon, &amp; ſtrength againſt thy euil fortune. I being in the Temple of the veſtal virgins, about three moneths hence, I receyued a letter of thine: the which was in ſuch ſort, that neither mine eyes for that tyme could make an end to read it, nor ſynce I haue had the hart to aunſwer it. For in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences of our frends, if wee haue no faculty nor might for to remedy it, at the leaſt wee are bound to beewaile it. Thy ſorow maketh mee ſo heauy, thy payn dooth trouble mee ſo much, I am ſo carefull of thy anguiſh, ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with thy grief, that if the gods had geeuen power to wofull men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part theire ſorows, as they haue geeuen to rych men to depart their goods: by the faith I owe to god, I ſweare, that as I am the greateſt of thy frends, I woold bee hee which ſhoold take the moſt part of thy griefes. I know ryght well, and as well as hee that hath prooued it, that aſmuch difference as there is beetween the bark &amp; the tree, the mary and the bone, the corn &amp; the ſtraw,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21411:253"/>
the gold and the droſſe, the trueth and the dreames: ſo much is there to here the trauailes of another, and to taſt his own. Notwithſtandyng comfort thy ſelf my frend <hi>Torquatus:</hi> for where the frends bee trew, the goods and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uills are common beetwyxt them. Oftentymes with my ſelf I haue maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to what end, or intencion, the immortall Gods haue geeuen trauaile, and torments to men, ſynce it is in their power to make vs to lyue wythout them. I ſee no other thyng, why the myſhaps ought pacyently to bee ſuffered: but beecauſe in thoſe, wee know who are our faithfull frends. In battaile the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyaunt man is knowen, in tempeſteous weather the Pilot is knowen, by the touch ſtone gold is tryed, and in aduerſyty the frend is knowen.</p>
                     <p>For my frend dooth not ynough to make mee mery, vnleſſe allſo hee dooth take part of my ſorow. I haue heard ſay here, and now by thy letter I haue ſeene, how they haue baniſhed thee from Rome, and confyſcated thy goods, and that for pure ſorow thow art ſick in thy bed: whereof I maruell not that thou art ſick, but to bee as thou art aliue. For ſaying to thee the trueth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the hart is ſore wounded, in ſhort ſpace it hath accuſtomed to yeeld vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body. I ſee well that thow complayneſt, and thou haſt reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playn, to ſee thy ſelf banyſhed from Rome, and thy goods confiſcate, to ſee thy ſelf out of thy countrey, without any parentage: yet therefore thy ſorow ought not to bee ſo extreame, that thow ſhooldſt put thy lyfe in hazard. For hee alone ought to haue lycence, and allſo is bound to hate lyfe, whych dooth not remember that hee hath ſerued the Gods, nor hath doone any profyt to men. If the affaires of the Empire dyd not occupy mee, and the emperyall maieſty dyd not wythdraw mee: I woold immedyatly haue to come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy perſon, where thow ſhooldſt haue ſeene by experience, wyth what grief I feele thy trouble. And therefore if thou takeſt mee for thy frend, thow oughtſt to beeleeue of mee that, which in this caſe I woold of thee: which is, that as thow haſt been the moſt entyer frend which I had in Rome: ſo ys thys the thing that moſt I haue felt in this lyfe. Tell mee my frend <hi>Torqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> what is it thow ſuffreſt there, that I doo not lament here? It may bee that ſometyme thow laugheſt, but I allways weepe: ſometimes thow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteſt thy ſelf, but I am allways ſad. It may bee that thow lightneſt thy payn: but I am in ſighyng. It may bee that ſometymes thow caſteſt from thee ſorow: but for mee I cannot receiue conſolation. It may bee that thow hopeſt remedy of longlyfe: but for mee I fynd no remedy more healthfull, then preſent death. Fynally I ſay, that here I feele all that thow feeleſt there, and furthermore I ſuffer all that, which as a frend I ought to ſuffer here: ſo that both our paynes are made one moſt cruell ſorrow, wherewyth my wofull lyfe is tormented. I woold greatly deſire to come and ſee thee, and to help to dyſburthen thee of this charge. And ſince it is vnpoſſyble for mee, I ſend thee this letter, wherein perchaunce thou ſhalt finde ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table woords. For thow knowſt, that if the trew frends cannot doo that which they ought: yet they doo accompliſh it, in dooyng that they can. If my memory deceyue mee not, it is well two and thirty yeares ſince wee two haue knowen togethers in Rome, duryng the which, fortune hath made here beetween vs dyuers alteracions, in the whych time I neuer ſaw thee one day contented. For if thow were ſad, nothyng dyd make thee mery, but were as
<pb facs="tcp:21411:254"/>
a man without taſt: and if thow were ioyfull, thou eſteemedſt it lytle, as a man beeyng troubled. Therefore if the trueth bee ſo (as in deede it is) that in trauayles thow were loden with ſorows, and in proſperities thow were euill content, ſo that of nothyng in the world thow takeſt any taſt: why is it (my frend <hi>Torquatus</hi>) that now agayn thow art in dyſpaire, as if thow cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt new into this world? Thou dydſt reioyce thy ſelf .xxxii. yeares, with the tryumphs and proſperyty of Rome: and thou complaineſt onely of three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, that fortune hath been contrary vnto thee. O <hi>Torquatus, Torquatus,</hi> dooſt thow know that the wiſe men (in whom wiſedome reigneth) haue more feare of two vnhappy days in this lyfe: then of two hundreth of proſperous fortune? O how many haue I ſeene goe out of their proſperyties, with the charges of another man, and their own proper vices? ſo that the vayn glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the fayling proſperity endured few days: but the griefe of that they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue loſt, and the enmyties which they haue recouered, endure many yeares. The contrary of all this commeth to infortunat men, which eſcape out of their tribulacions ſpoyled of vyces, enuyronned with vertues: perſecutours of euill, zelers of good: frends of all, and enemies of none: contented with theirs, and not deſyryng others: fynally they are ſcaped wiſely from the ſnare, and haue gathered the roſe, not hurting them ſelues with the pricks. What wylt thow that I ſay more vnto thee, but that the moſt fortunat are vanquyſhed in peace: and the vnfortunat are conquerers in warre? One of the ſentences which moſt haue contented mee, of thoſe which the auncyents haue ſpoken, is this, of the deuine <hi>Plato.</hi> That thoſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> are in proſperyty, haue no leſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of good counſaile: then the vnhappy haue of remedy. For no leſſe doo they trauayle, which goe always in the playn way: then thoſe which mount on the ſharp craggy mountayn. Accordyng to that I haue gathered of thy letter, mee ſeemeth that when wee hope moſt reſt, greateſt trauaile hath ſucceeded to thee. And hereof I doo not maruell, nor thow oughtſt not to bee offended. For as experience teacheth vs, when the trees haue the bloſſomes, then they are moſt ſubiect to the froſt. And when glaſſes are drawen out of the furnace, they breake. The captayns hauing wonne the victory, doo dye. When they will put the key in the doore, the houſe dooth fall. The pyrats periſh, withyn the kenning of land. By that I haue ſpoken I mean, that when wee thynk to haue made peace with fortune, then ſhee hath a new demaund ready for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. All new chaunges of fortune, cauſeth allway new payn to the parſon: but oftentymes it is cauſe of more great fortreſſe. For the tree beareth not ſo much fruit, where it fyrſt grew, as there where it is agayn planted: and the ſauors are more odiferous, when they are moſt chafed. I mean, that men of hye thoughts, the more they are wrapped in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> frownings of fortune, the more valiaunt and ſtout they ſhew them ſelues. The man vtterly is foolyſh, or hath great want of vnderſtandyng, who hopeth at any time to haue perfect reſt, immaginyng that the world will geeue no aſſault vppon hym: but that the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſhall come, wherein hee ſhallbee without care and feare. This myſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lyfe is of ſuch condicion, that dayly our yeares doo diminiſh, and our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles encreaſe. O <hi>Torquatus,</hi> by the immortall gods I doo deſire thee, and in the faith of a frend I doo require thee, thow beeing born in the world, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhyng thy ſelf in the world, lyuing in the world, beeing conuerſaunt in the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21411:254"/>
world, beeing a chyld of the world, and following the world, what dydſt thow hope of the world, but things of the world? Peraduenture thow alone wilt eat the fleaſh without bones, geeue battaile without peryll, trauaile wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out payn, and ſayle by the ſea without dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. I mean, that it is vnpoſſible for mortall men to lyue in the world, vnleſſe they wyll beecome ſubiect to the ſorows of the world. The world hath allways been the world, and now the world ſhallbee after vs, and as a world ſhall handell the worldlyngs,</p>
                     <p>The wyſe men, and thoſe which of their eſtates are carefull, are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſee, nor ſuperfycially to know the things: but rather way them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly. I ſay this, beecauſe if thow knewſt thy debylyty, and knewſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and her chaunge, if thow knewſt the men, and their malyces, if thow knewſt the world, and his flatteryes: thow ſhooldſt wynne no lytle honor, where as otherwiſe thou mayſt chaunce to get infamy. Wee are now come to ſo great folly, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee wyl not ſerue the Gods, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> haue created vs: nor abſtain from the world, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> perſecuteth vs. And the beſt is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee not wyllyng vs (but rather reiectyng vs) wee ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of our own willes wee will loue &amp; ſerue hym: &amp; yet knowyng that thoſe which longeſt haue ſerued the world, doo goe out of hys houſe moſt bytterly lamentyng. Oftentymes I ſtay to thynk, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the multitude of men which follow the world, beeyng allways euyll handled of the world) if the world dyd pray them, as hee dooth annoy them, yf hee dyd comfort them, as hee dooth torment them, yf hee kept them, as hee banyſheth them, yf hee exalted them, as hee abuſeth them, yf hee receyued them, as hee expelleth them, yf hee dyd contynew them, as hee conſumeth them: I thynk that the Gods ſhould not bee honored in heauen, nor the Temples woorſhypped in the earth. O <hi>Torquatus</hi> my frend that which now I wyll ſay of thee, thow mayſt ſay of mee. That is to weete, how much wee put our confydence in fortune, how lewdly wee paſſe our days, and how much wee are blynded in the world: yet for all that wee credyt his woord as much, as though hee had neuer mocked any.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21411:255"/>
The which experience plainly ſheweth vs, for the man which medleth much wyth the world, leaueth always ſuſpicion of hym that hee is not trew. The world is an imbaſſadour of the euill, a ſcourge of the good, cheefeſt of vyces, a tyraunt of the verteous, a breaker of peace, a frend of warre, a ſweete wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of vices, the gawle of the vertuous, a defender of lyes, an inuenter of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelties, a trauailer of the ignoraunt, a hammer for the malicious, a table of gluttons, and a furnace of concupyſcence: fynally, it is the peryll of <hi>Charibde,</hi> where the harts doo periſh: and the daunger of <hi>Scilla,</hi> where the thoughts doo waſt. Preſuppoſe that theſe bee the condicions of the world. The trouth is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if there bee any worldlyng who complaineth to bee euil content w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the world ſhall hee therefore chaunge his ſtile? Truely no, and the reaſon is, that if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce one worldling ſhoold goe out of the houſe of the world, there are ten thouſand vanities at his gate. I know not what wyſe man will lyue in the world with ſuch condicions, ſince the vices wherewith wee doo reioyce our ſelues are very few, in reſpect of the torments which wee ſuffer. I ſay not that wee doo heare it by heare ſay, and read them in bookes: but wee ſee with our own eyes, the one to conſume and waſt the goods, others by myſfortune to fall, and loſe their credyt, others to fall and loſe their honor, and others to loſe their lyfe, and all theſe myſeries ſeene, yet neuertheleſſe euery man thynketh to bee free by priuiledge, where there is none priuileged: O my frend <hi>Torquatus,</hi> of one thing I aſſure thee, which is, that the men whych are borne of women are ſo euill a generacion, and ſo cruel is the world where in wee liue, and fortune ſo empoyſoned with whom wee frequent: that wee cannot eſcape without beeing ſpurned with his feete, bytten with his teeth, torne wyth his nayles, or impoyſoned with hys venym. Peraduenture thou mayſt ſay vnto mee that thow haſt ſeene ſome in Rome, whych haue lyued long tyme, fortune neuer beeyng againſt hym? To this I aunſwer thee, that thow oughtſt rather to haue pyty vppon hym, then enuy: for it is not for his profyt, but for his great hynderaunce. For the world is ſo malycious, that when it ſeemeth to bee moſt our frend, then it woorketh vs moſt dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. The healthfull men dye rather of a ſhort diſeaſe in few dayes: then the dry and feeble men doo, with a diſeaſe of many yeares. By this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon I mean, that ſince man cannot eſcape, nor liue without trauaile: it is much better, that by litle and lytle hee taſteth them, then they enter all at one time into his houſe. O how much ought the man to bee hated of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall gods, who knoweth not what trauaile meaneth in this world? For hee onely ought to feare fortune, who knoweth not fortunes force. Since the gods woold permyt, and thy myſhap hath beene ſuch, that thow haſt found more daunger, where thow thoughtſt moſt ſurety as a man euill fortuned: it is reaſon that wee apply vnto thee ſome new ware, to the end thow loſe not thy good renowme, ſynce thow haſt loſt thy euill goods,</p>
                     <p>Tell mee I praye thee <hi>(Torquatus)</hi> why dooſt thow complayn as a man ſick? why cryeſt thow as a foole? why ſygheſt thow as a man in dyſpayre? and why dooſt thow weepe as a chyld? Thow art come out of the way.</p>
                     <p>And thow complaineſt to haue loſt thy way. Thou ſaileſt by the broiling ſeas: &amp; thou wondereſt that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waues doo aſſault thee. Thou haſt aſcended y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſteepe,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21411:255"/>
and craggy mountayns: and thow complayneſt that thow art weary. Thow walkeſt by the thornes: and wylt not that thy gown bee torne.</p>
                     <p>Dydſt thow thynk in the top of the hygh mountayn to lyue moſt ſure? By that I haue ſpoken, I wyll aſk what dyligent ſeruice thow haſt doone to the world, that thow wooldſt the gods of heauen ſhoold recompence thee? Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thow of fortune a ſafe conduct, ſhee beeing (as ſhee is) enemy of many, nature beeyng not able to geeue it, the which is mother of all? O my frend <hi>Torquatus,</hi> that whych the pytyfull nature cannot promyſe thee, dydſt thow thynk that fortune (which is the iuſt ſtepmother) ſhould geeue? It is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſyble that the Sea ſhould always promiſe vs ſuerty, and the heauen clere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the ſommer dews, and the wynter froſts. Mark well, mark my frend <hi>Torquatus,</hi> that all naturall thyngs are ſubiect to chaunge euery yeare: but all the worldlyngs ought to endure to eclypſe euery moment.</p>
                     <p>Synce the naturall goods cannot always bee in one mans cuſtody, beeing neceſſary, it is iuſt that the goods of fortune peryſh, ſince they are ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Vniuſt ſhoold the Gods bee, if that whych is to the domage of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, they had made perpetuall: and that which is to the profyt of all, they had made mortall. I will no more reduce to thy memory, the proſperyty w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> thow haſt had in times paſt: beefore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee treat how fortune handleth thee at thys preſent. The deceytfull fortune, when at thy gate ſhee ſold her marchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſe, knowyng that ſhee ſold vnto thee, and thow beeyng ignoraunt of that thow boughtſt: ſhee gaue thee frutefull ground, and afterward made it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee paynfull. Shee hath geeuen thee ſower for ſweete: and the ſweete ſhee hath returned to the ſower. Shee hath geeuen thee the euill for the good: and where that thow haſt ſold her good: ſhee retourned vnto thee euyl. Fynally ſhee hath beeguyled thee in the iuſt pryſe: thow not ſuppoſyng that thow hadſt receiued any domage. Wee can doo no leſſe in this caſe but to haue compaſſyon vppon thee: yet though they condempne malicyous for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune for ſellyng, they wyll note thee ſymple in buying. For in the ſhop of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, all marchaundyſe are ſuſpycious. O vnhappy that wee are, I ſay thoſe whych meddle with the world: for in his market they ſee nought but lyes, and wee doo not truſt but in the ouerthrows of our renowne: whych are not payd, but with the coſt of our lyfe. And the factours of that faire, geeue vs nothyng by weight, or meaſure: for they are a ſort of vacabounds, and the woorſt of all is, knowyng that they ought to loſe wyth fortune, all ſeeke to buy at her ſhop. Geeue thy ſelf to the world, loue the world much, ſerue the world well, follow the world well, and feele the world well: for in the end of the iourney, the world requyreth thee to bee lyke vnto hys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy. I woold enter into count, not wyth the world, which in the end is the world: but with the worldlyngs, which are in loue with the world. For in the end, eyther it is good or euyll. If the world bee good for them, whereof doo they complayne? If hee bee euyll, why doo they follow hym? They can not (though they woold) deny one of the two errours wherein the worldlyngs fall: that is to weete, that they ſerue an euill maiſter, or that they murmour of a good lord.

wherefore it were now hye time that betweene thee and hym were ſome dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.

                        <hi>LIcurgus, Promotheus, Solon,</hi> and <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> famous inuenters, and ordeyners of laws, ſhewed the ſubtilty of their wittes, and the zeale which they had to their people, in ordeining many laws which they tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght: not only what they ought to doo: but that which they ought to fly. For the good and expert phiſicions doo deſerue more praiſe to preſerue vs beefore wee are ſick: then to heale vs after wee are diſeaſed <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his apothegmes neuer ceaſeth to exalt the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> ſaying: that when they did obſerue their laws, they were the moſt eſteemed of al the greekes: and after that they brake them, they were the moſt vyleſt ſubiects, which euer the Romains had. The felicity or infelicity of realms, dooth not conſiſt to haue good or euil laws: but to haue good or euill princes. For litle profyteth vs the law to bee iuſt, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng bee wicked., <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> in the life of <hi>Nerua</hi> ſayth, when the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns and the Greekes had warres togethers, &amp; that the imbaſſadours of theſe two nations were at controuerſy, which of them ſhoold haue the Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diens to bee their frends: the Greeke embaſſadour ſaid to the Romayn. Yee ought not to make your ſelues egall, O Romayns, with the Greekes, ſins the troth is, that yee came from Rome to Greece to ſeeke laws. The romain embaſſadour aunſwered him, I graunt thee, that from Rome wee ſent to ſeeke laws in Greece: but thou wilt not denay, that from Greece you haue brought the vices to Rome. I ſay vnto thee the trouth, that without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, greater domage haue the vices doon vnto vs: then your laws hath profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in an epiſtle hee wrate to <hi>Traiane,</hi> ſayd theſe woords. Thow writeſt vnto mee, moſt noble prynce, that thou art occupyed in ordeyning new laws: but in my oppinion it had been much better, that thou hadſt kept, &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee kept the old. For lytle profyteth it to haue the bookes full of good laws, and that the common wealth bee full of euill cuſtomes. I haue ſeene very few Princes, but to make laws they had hability ſufficient and to keep them, they haue felt in them ſelues great debylity and weakneſſe. Hereof wee haue example. For <hi>Nero</hi> was hee which made the beſt laws in Rome: and that afterwards of lyfe was moſt corrupt. For the gods oftentimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that by the hands of ſome euill men, the others ſhoold bee conſtrained to bee good. <hi>Plutarche</hi> ſayeth further. If thow wilt (noble Prince) truſt thyne own vnderſtanding, in my poore counſayl, in few woords I woold recite vnto thee al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> auncyent laws. I wil ſend thee very brief &amp; ſweete laws, not to thend thow ſhooldſt publyſh them in Rome: but to the end thou kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe them in thy houſe. For ſynce thow haſt made laws for all. I wyll ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke laws for thee. The fyrſt law is, that thow beehaue thy ſelf in ſuch ſort, that thow bee not noted of any notable vice: For yf the prynce bee vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in hys pallace, none dare bee dyſſolute in hys houſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:257"/>The ſecond law is, that equally thou keepe iuſtice, as well to him which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth farre of, as to him which is neere about thee: for it is much better y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou depart of thy goods to thy ſeruants, then that thou ſhooldſt geeue that iuſtice, which apperteineth to others. The thyrd law is, that thou delyght in woord and deede to bee true, and that they take thee not in this default to ſpeak too much. For prynces which in their woords are vncertayn, and in their promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doubtfull, ſhal bee hated of their frends, and mocked of their enemies.</p>
                     <p>The fourth law is, that thou bee very gentle of condicion, and not forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of ſeruices doon. For vnthankful princes are hated of god, &amp; deſpiſed of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
                     <p>The fift law is, that as a peſtilence thou chaſe from thee flatterers. For ſuch with their euill lyfe, doo diſturb a whole common wealth: and with their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, doo darken thy renowne. If thou (moſt noble prince) wilt obſerue the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe .v. laws, thou ſhalt neede to make no moe laws: For there is no neede of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther law in the common wealth, but to ſee that the prince bee of good life. This wrote <hi>Plutarche</hi> to <hi>Traian,</hi> and euery vertuous man ought to haue them writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his hart. I was willing to touch this hiſtory onely to ſhew the profyt of this laſt law, where it ſayth, that princes admit into their conuerſation no flatterers, of whom it is reaſon wee talke of now: For ſo much as there are dyuers men, with whom they loſe their time, and ſpend their goods. When Rome was well ordered, two officers were greatly eſtemed to the Romains. The one was the maiſters of fence, which were as men that fought and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and many times in that fyght they were ſlaine. And the cauſe to inuent this play, was to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end yong men (not expert in warre) ſhoold ſee the ſwords drawen, ſharp ſperes, ſhootyng of croſſebows, to geeue blows with their ſword, to ſhed blood, to geeue cruell wounds, and to ſley men: For in this ſort they loſt feare, and in goyng to the warre they recouered courage. The man which hath once paſt a fourd in the water though it bee in the night, dare pas it again. But hee which hath neuer paſſed it ouer though it bee in the day, dare not auenture it. I mean, that the Romains were very ſage, to ſhew vnto their children the daungers, beefore they did put them therein. For this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence beetwene the fearefull hart, and the couragious ſtomack, in that the one flyeth from a diſtaffe, and the other is not afrayd of a ſweord.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond office which was eſteemed in Rome was, that of the iugglers, ieſters, comediants, and of ſuch others, which inuented playes, and paſtimes: and the romayns deuiſed theſe ſports, to reioyce the people: and in eſpecially men of warre, whom they feaſted at their goyng foorth, and much more at their comming home. For the Romains thinking that they ſhoold bee wyth ſuch glory receyued, went with determinacion eyther to winne the victory, or to dye in battaile. The auncient and true Romains had ſuch care for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth of their people, that they conſented that ieſters ſhoold ieſt, iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers ſhoold iuggle, and the players of enterludes ſhoold play: But this was not through abundaunce of vanyty, nor for want of grauity, but to take from the Plebeians occaſion of idlenes, and to keepe them occupied in other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler playes: they woold that all the pleaſures ſhoold bee taken togethers. Not without cauſe I ſay, that the pleaſures were taken in commen, that is to weete, that no romayn could play any playes particularly, make any bankets, repreſent comedies, nor make any feaſts beeſide thoſe, which they made to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21411:257"/>
the whole people, ſo that in Rome they trauayled ſeuerally, and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced togethers. I would to god that ſuch and ſo excellent a romain cuſtome were obſerued in our chriſtian common wealth.</p>
                     <p>But I am very ſory that indifferently rich, and poore, great and ſmall, doo play comedyes, roune the bulles, make iuſt ordein bankets, weare deuiſes, feaſt the ladyes ſpend in bankets and inuent feaſts. The which things alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether doo redound to the domage of the common wealth, to the waſt of the goods, and to the corrupcion of the maners: for the particuler paſtimes doo encreaſe new vices to breede in mè. Theſe players did ſerue in rome to make paſtime at the great feaſts of their Gods: For ſince Romayns were great worſhippers of their gods, and ſo careful of their temples, they ſought to feaſt them al the ways they could inuent. Truly this was doon by the deuine ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, for their gods beeing laughing ſtocks (as in deed they were) the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing god would they ſhould bee ſerued, honoured, and feaſted by ieſtures, and mocks. <hi>Blondus</hi> in the third booke <hi>de Roma triumphante</hi> mencioneth the which I haue haue ſpoken, and ſayth. That the Romayns were no leſſe curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to giue laws to the iudglers, and ieſters, which went mocking vp and down Rome: then to the captayns which were fighting in the warre. For though they did permit ieſters, players and iuglers, to exerciſe their offices: yet they did commaund theim that their liues might bee vpright and iuſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, ſuch were the laws, which the romayns ordeyned for theſe ieſters, iuglers, players, and tomblers.</p>
                     <p>The firſt law was, they commaunded that they ſhould all bee knowen, and examined, to ſee if they were honeſt men, wiſe, and ſage. For the more their offices were vaine, ſo much the more they prouided, that they were gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to wiſe men. The ſecond law commaunded to examine them, to ſee if they were able, and comly to exerciſe their offices: and in deed in this caſe, as well as in the other, they had reaſon, as very a foole is hee w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> for harkneth to a foole not pleaſant, as the foole him ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The third law was that they did not permit any Romaine iugler to exerciſe ſuch feats, oneles hee had ſome other craft. So that if they occupyed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly days to play and ſhew paſtyme in the ſtreats, the other days they ſhould woork at home at their houſes. The fourth law was, that no iugler nor vice ſhould bee ſo hardy in his oſtentacions to ſpeake any malices: and in deede it was a law very neceſſary. For often times they are few which doo reioyce at their mockryes: and many which complayne of their malices.</p>
                     <p>The fift law was that no iugler or ieſter, ſhould bee ſo bold to make any paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>times in any particuler houſes, but in open places. For otherwiſe, thoſe which ſpake them beecame hardy, and thoſe which heard them were vicious.</p>
                     <p>The Romayns not contented to haue made theſe lawes, ordeyned that the iuglers for no paſtimes ſhewed, or any other thing ſpoken ſhould bee ſo bold as to receyue any mony. And to auoyde their complaynts, and to ſatiſfy theyr paynes, they allowed euery one of them a thouſand ſexterces yerely out of the common treaſure. Wee ought greatly to prayſe the prouidence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romayns, which haue preſcribed a kinde of life for the ieſters to liue: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they did to other men of rome, and to the captains of war.

And wee wil not deny but that they had reaſon, ſins with theim they honoured the gods they tooke their pleaſures, the reioyced their feaſtes, they were very quick men, nor importunate, nor couetous. The ieſter hath no grace, onleſſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly a man putteth his hand to the purſe. Wee finde ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e fragments of an ora<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion which <hi>Cicero</hi> made in the ſenat, greatly reprouing the Senators, and all the people, beecauſe they ſo willingly gaue eare to this ieſter, who ſtirred vp ſedition among the commons, his name was <hi>Roſcio,</hi> who was ſo greatly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed in rome that the Romayns did more willingly heare that which hee ſayd in his ieſts, than that which <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpake in good earneſt: This ieſter <hi>Roſcio</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> ſtryued which of them both were of greater witt, <hi>Roſcio</hi> for preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting a thing with diuers ieſts, or <hi>Cicero</hi> pronouncing waity matters in earneſt. When I rede in <hi>Iulius Capitolinus</hi> that which I haue ſpoken, I will not ceaſe to confeſſe mine innocency, for that I could not then keepe my ſelf from laughing to ſee that <hi>Roſcio,</hi> beeing Prince of foly: did preſume to diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pute with <hi>Cicero,</hi> which was father of eloquence. Sith all theſe things are vnſtable in one, ſo from one day to another wee ſee them chaunge. The ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns dyd greatly eſteeme the pollicy of the common wealth, the diſcipline of warre, the nurture of children, the exercyſe of the yong, and the honeſty of the players, and iuglers: the which in time came to bee diſſolute, that very oft they were occaſion of great ſlaunder among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people. The which by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns ſeene, and conſidered, and that the ieſters which were wont to ſhew them pleaſures, were cauſe of diſcenſion (and where all they commaunded them to bee reſydente in their offices, they were vacabonds, and that vſing them as ſages, they liued as loyterers and fooles, not contented with that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they gaue them of the common treaſure, but they went begging of euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) the Senat of rome determined among them ſelues to baniſh al the iuglers, and ieſters, out of the common wealth. On this execution of theſe loyterers, ſprang dyues dyſſentions among the people. For the Princes which were good, caſt them out: and thoſe which were euill, called them in. So that one of the tokens which were in Rome to know a vertuous, or vitious prince was to ſee if hee maintained ieſters, iuglers, or vacabonds, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the people. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Apothegmes ſayeth, that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did neuer permit any iugler or ieſter to bee in the common wealth. And when one did demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> by an imbaſſador of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> what was the occaſion to make ſuch a law, ſince the the ieſters, &amp; players, ſhewed pleaſure to the people, and the people loſt nought but laughed at their folly: the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> anſwered. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> ſaw, hard, felt, or red ſome great domage the ieſters, iuglers or pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, might doo in the common welth, ſince agaynſt them hee made this ſo ſtraight a law. But that which I know is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee <hi>Greekes</hi> are better, weeping
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21411:258"/>
with our ſages: then are the Romayns laughing at their fooles. <hi>Dio</hi> in the life of <hi>Traian</hi> declareth, that there came a iugler to Rome fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Affricke,</hi> whoſe conueyance was ſo clene, that it was a wonderfull thing to ſee what ſeats hee did, and to heare what words hee ſpake. And when they prayd the good Emperor <hi>Traian,</hi> that it would pleaſe him to heare him, hee aunſwered. It is not for the authority of a graue and vertuous prince, that in his preſence any ſuch vayne thing ſhould bee ſhewed. For in ſuch a caſe, hee ſhoold bee no les noted of lightnes, then the other accuſed of folly. And further hee ſayd. Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore princes a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould not be ſo hardy to ſpeake diſhoneſt woords, nor ſhew light repreſentacions. And in ſuch caſe as much payne deſerue they which moue him thereto: as thoſe which doo repreſent them. For a man ought not to put beefore princes things which ſhould allure them to vices: but things w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſhoold moue them to vertues. Certainly theſe woords were worthy of ſuch a perſonage. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> in the life of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> declareth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in Rome ther was a ieſter very pleaſant &amp; of an excellent wyt caled <hi>Epifanius</hi> who one day vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a holyday to ſhew the Emperor ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e pleaſure &amp; hoping to haue a good reward, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pallace at one time in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> attire of a page, &amp; another time i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bite of a Romayn matron: and ſo truely counterfeted euery thing that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to bee him, but the ſelf ſame parſon hee repreſented. The Emperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was greatly diſpleſed with that the ieſter had doon, and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded forth with that hee ſhoold bee whipt iii. tyms about the theater. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee complayned, that the Emperor commaunded vacabonds to bee whipped once, and hee thriſe, the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi> aunſwered. Once they ſhall whip thee, for the iniury thou didſt to the Romayn matron, whom thou didſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent. The ſecond time they ſhall whip thee, for the preſumption that thou haſt to repreſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it before my parſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The third for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time thou haſt made diuers loſe, for beeholding and hearing thee. For ieſters doo not deſerue ſo much puniſhment, in the ieſtes and mockries they doo ſay: as for the time which they loſe, and cauſe others to loſe. Certaynly the puniſhment which was gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the ieſter, was very iuſt: and exceading good were the woords, which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſayd. There was an other in the time of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Pilas.</hi> And when the Emperor had banyſhed all the ieſters, and iuglers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rome, this <hi>Pilas</hi> was ſo pleaſant, &amp; mery w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all perſons, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great inſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they bee ſought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor to reuoke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> requeſt in deed was ſo great as if it had been for a Philoſopher, they could haue doon no more. For dayn, &amp; light me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, employ rather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue, on him who bringeth vnto theim ſome folye: then on one, which teacheth and correcteth their lyfe. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror condeſcended to the requeſt of the people, on ſuch condicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſhould geeue a mayſter and tutor to <hi>Pilas,</hi> that ſhoold chaſtice and correct him as a foole.

ſtoupe: and now ſhee is not able to baniſh ieſters, and fooles. And that that is woorſe of al, they haue preſumption to vexe vs, and wee haue not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to reproue them. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had great reaſon and alſo the Romayns, to ryd their common wealth of ieſters. For they are idel, vitious, diſhoneſt, malycious, and preiudyciall to the common wealth. Theſe ieſters and iuglers are idell, ſeeing that more then others, they eat the ſwette of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. They are vicious, for they can not excerciſe their offices but in vices, and in treatyng with vicious men. They are diſhoneſt, for they get not to eat by dooing good woorks: but by ſpeaking dyſhoneſt woords. They are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, for they haue accuſtomed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they loue not a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, immediatly to ſpeak euyll of hym. They are vnprofitable for the common wealth, for they mock vs and ſel vs vaine woords: and wee pay them good money. The world is come to ſo great folly, and corruption, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as graue and wyſe men think it great inconuenience, to bee conuerſaunt with vayne, and fond men: ſo the Lords of eſtate think it an honor, to haue in their houſe, ſome foolyſh ieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, yea better to ſay (with reuerence of ſpeache) raylyng knaues, which ſpeake not to pleaſe and ſhew paſtyme, but to offend the preſent, and rayl at the abſent, aſwell of the high, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> low, and that that is more yet then this, is that they are not contentyd to haue gyuen this enterteinment and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to the noble men and Ientlemen that are at their lords boord: but they muſt needs haue a caſt at my lord hym ſelfe to chere him with all: which intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable abuſe ought not onely not to bee ſuffered, but with moſt ſharpe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection puniſhed. But what ſhall wee ſay, that for the moſt part the lords are ſo vaine and the ieſters ſo preſumptuous and arrogant: that the Lords haue more care to contente them, then they haue to pleaſe the lords. In the houſe of a lord, a foole at the end of the yere will aſk more, then any other of thoſe which are moſt auncient, ſo that the follyes of one are more acceptable, then the ſeruyces of all. It is ſhame to ſpeake it, and no leſſe to wryte it, that the Children of vanity are ſo vayne, that they brybe a foole or a ieſter no leſſe in theſe days, to thintent hee may bee a meane for them vnto the Prince: then they did in times paſt deſire <hi>Cicero,</hi> to make an oration for them beefore the Senat. It is for want of vnderſtanding, and through the vilety of perſon oppreſſion of the hart, and diſprayſe of renowme, to bee deſirous by the mean of fooles, too attayne to any thing. For hee can haue no great wyſedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, which putteth hys hope in the fauor of a foole. What remayneth for mee to ſay, when I haue ſayd that which I will ſay? And it is, that if a ieſter or foole ſay openly to ſome lord, God ſaue your lyfe my good lord. Oh hee is a noble man in deed hee will not ſtick to geeue hym a gowne of ſilk: and entring into a church, hee would not geeue a poore man a halpeny.</p>
                     <p>O what negligence is there of princes? O what vanity of Lords? ſince they forſake the poore and wiſe, to enrych the ieſters and fooles. They haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the world, and not for Iheſus Chriſt: they geeue to thoſe that aſk for his louers ſake, and not to thoſe which aſk for the health of the ſoule. Hee ought not to doo ſo: for the knyght which is a Chriſtian, and not a worldlyng, ought rather to will that the poore doo pray for hym at the hower of death: then that the fooles, and ieſters ſhould prayſe him in his lyfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:21411:259"/>What dooth it profit the ſoule, or the body, that the ieſters doo prayſe thee for a cote thou haſt geeuen them: and that the poore accuſe thee, for the bread thou haſt denayed them? Peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture it wil profyt thee aſmuch, that a foole or a flaterer, goe beefore a Prince apparayled with a new lyuery of thine: as the poore men ſhall doo thee damage beefore God, to whome thou haſt deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a poore ragged ſhirt? All gentlemen, and noble parſonages, in the name of our ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt I admonyſh, exhort, and humbly require, that thei conſyder well what they ſpend, and to whom they geeue, for the good Princes, ought to haue more reſpect of the neceſſityes of the poore: then of the follyes of counterfayts. Geeue as yee wyl, deuide as ye liſt, for at the houre of death, as much as yee haue laughed with the fooles, for that ye haue gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, ſo much ſhall ye weepe with the poore, for that ye haue denayed them. At the houre of death it ſhalbee greeuous paynes to him that dyeth, to ſee the fleſh of the orphanes all naked, and to beehold counterfaite fooles lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with their garments. Of one thing I am amaſed, that indifferently euery man may beecome a foole, and no man let him: and the woorſt of al is, if once a foole beecome couetous, al the world afterwards cannot make him to to bee in his right ſenſes. Truly ſuch one which hath no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee a foole, at the leaſt hee hath good occaſion: ſince hee getteth more to eat playeng, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the others doo woorking. O what negligence of the princes, and what ſmal reſpect of the gouernours of the common wealth is this? that a yong man, whole, ſtout, ſtrong, and valiaunt, ſhould bee ſuffred to goe from houſe to houſe from table to table, and only for babbling vayne words, and telling ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lyes, hee ſhould bee counted a man of an excellent tong? Another foly there is in this caſe, that their woordes are not ſo fooliſh, as their deedes are wicked. And though they haue a good, or euel grace: yet in the end, they bee counted in the common wealth, as loyterers and fooles. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this caſe is greater, either their folly, or our lyghtnes: for they vſe as fooles, in telling vs lyes, and wee pay them good mony. The Romaynes dyd not permit in their common wealthes, old ſtale ieſters: nor wee Chriſtyans ought to retayne into our houſes, idel loyterers. Ye ought to know that more offendeth hee which ſinneth with a defourme woman: then hee which ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with a beautifull lady. And hee which is drunk with ſower ale offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth more then hee which is drunk with ſweete wyne. And ſo in like maner greater offence commit they which loſe their times with fooles that haue no grace: then with ieſters, which haue good witts. For it may bee permitted ſometyme, that the ſage man for the recreation of his ſpyrits, doo frequent the company of ſome pleaſant man.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21411:260"/>
which thou didſt ſend mee. I haue cauſed my gowne to bee furred, and am girded with the girdel which thou didſt preſent mee, and am greatly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thy hounds. For all is ſo good, that the body doth reioyce to poſſeſſe it, and the eyes to beehold it, and alſo the hart to render thanks for it. Where I dyd aſk a few things of thee in ieſt, thou haſt ſent mee many in erneſt, wherin not as a ſeruant, but as a frend thou haſt ſhewed thy ſelfe. For the office of noble and worthyharts, is to offer to their frends, not onli that which they demaund: but that alſo which they think they wil demaund. Truly thou haſt better meaſured thy ſeruices, by thy noblenes: then I thee demaund by my couetouſnes. For if thou dooſt remember, I did demaund of thee only .xii. ſkinnes: and thou haſt ſent mee .12. doſen. I told thee that I deſired .6. hounds for to hunt: and thou haſt ſent me .12. of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt that can bee fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the Ile. In ſuch ſorte, that I haue had honor: and thou haſt wonn renowne. For in the litel I haue demaunded, they ſhall ſee my lytel couetouſnes: and in the much thou haſt ſent mee, they ſhall perceiue thy great lyberalyty. I eſteeme highly that which thou haſt ſente mee: and I beeſeech the gods ſend thee good luck. For thou knowſt, wee may render thankes for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefits receyued: but wee haue not the power to requite the gentlenes ſhewed. For the man which dare receiue of an other any gift, dooth bynd hym ſelfe to bee his ſlaue. I can not bee thy ſlaue, for I am thy frend: and thereof thou oughſt to reioyce, more then an other. For beeing a ſeruaunt, I ſhould ſerue thee with feare: but bee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing thy frend, I wyl profit thee w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> frendſhip. Therfore to declare the cheefe occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherfore I write vnto thee at this preſent, I ſay, I ſend thee .3. ſhips loden with ieſters &amp; iuglers, loyterers, vacabonds, and fooles: and yet I doo not ſend vnto thee al the vacabonds which are in Rome, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy Ile ſhould bee peopled with ſtraungers. The office that they had, was that ſoom of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ieſted and rayled at the table, ſoome ſang ſundry malicious ſongs at mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, others told lies and news for their dinners at the gates, other playd co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon plays in the ſtreats, other enterteined the roman matrones with fooliſh nouells and tales, others ſet forth vayne and light bookes of rymes and bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets: and yet I ſwere vnto thee by the god <hi>Hercules,</hi> theſe loiterers wanted no fooles to here them. I let thee weete, my frend Lambert, that theſe loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are ſuch, and their ſcolers in nomber ſo many that though the mayſters may bee in .3. ſhips caried: yet the ſchollers could not bee in an hundred tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Of one thing I meruell much, and alſo I affirme, that the Gods bee offended, ſince earthquakes ouerthrew the houſes, the great waters cary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the bridges, the froſt freeſe the vines, the corrupt ayre infecteth the wiſe men: and yet is there no plague that conſumeth the fooles? O how vnhappy art thou Rome, vnto him that ſhall well beehold thee, and dilygently ſerch thee. For in thee wanteth valyant captayns, honeſt Senatours, iuſt Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſors, faithfull officers, and vertuous Princes: and onely there aboundeth fooles, ieſters, plaiers, dyſers, loyterers, and vacabo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. O what ſeruice thou ſhouldſt doo to the gods, and profit to our mother Rome, if for .3. ſhips of fooles, thou didſt ſend vs one bark only of wiſe men? I would not ſay (but I wyll not ceaſe to ſay) that I haue ſeene fooles, that I haue heard many folys: but I ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer ſaw ſo great fooles, nor hard ſuch extreme folly, as that of ſome noble ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and <hi>Italyens,</hi> who think it a great act to keepe a foole in their houſe.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21411:260"/>
I iudge him to bee a greater foole, that ſo deſireth to keepe a foole: then the foole hym ſelfe. For a foole hath a ſemblaunce of the ſage, after that hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth with a ſage: but the ſage ſheweth him ſelfe a foole, after hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth with a foole. Why doo men ſeeke thinges of mockry? ſince all that is in the world is mockry? Why ſeeke wee fooles? Since all that wee ſay, is nothing but foly? Why doo wee reioyce with thoſe which flatter vs? ſince there are none, that ſay one onely trueth? Why doo wee ſeeke fained fooles: Since that all, or the moſt parte of vs all, are very fooles? I ſee dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in Rome, the which though they company with honeſt men, are diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, companyeng with ſages they are ſymple, treating with wiſe men, they are without conſideracion, and beeing conuerſant with fooles, they think to bee ſage. If wee keepe company with pitefull, wee ſhalbee pityfull.</p>
                     <p>If wee bee conuerſant with the cruell, wee ſhall be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e cruel. If wee comuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with lyers, wee ſhal bee lyers. Yf wee haunt the true, wee ſhal be true: and if wee deſire the fooliſh, wee ſhalbee fooles. For according to the maſters and doctrines wee haue: ſuch ſhall bee the ſciences which wee ſhall learne, &amp; the woorks which wee ſhal folow. The famous tirant <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the <hi>Siracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſane,</hi> which was in <hi>Scicil,</hi> ſaied vnto the philoſopher <hi>Diogenes.</hi> Tel mee <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes,</hi> what kinde of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought wee to haue in our houſes, &amp; with what per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons ought wee to deuide our goods? <hi>Diogenes</hi> aunſwered him. The wiſe man which will liue in peace with the comon wealth, and that wyl not ſee his goods euyll employd, ought not to geeue to eat, nor to accompany with any, but with the aged perſons which ſhould counſaile them, and with the yong which ſhould ſerue them, with frends which ſhould fauour them, and with the poore, to the end they ſhould prayſe them. <hi>Denis</hi> the tiraunt greatly comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that, which <hi>Diogenes</hi> the philoſopher told him: but hee could neuer profyt with that counſayle. For as hee ſhewed him ſelfe a tirant in robbing: ſo hee ſhewed him ſelfe alſo vndiſcreete in ſpending. Preſuppoſe that that which <hi>Diogenes</hi> the philoſopher ſpake were true, that is to weete, that wee ought to feede the aged, ſeruants, frends, and poore: wee ſee by this aunſwere, it is not iuſt to geeue to eat, eyther to ieſters, minſtrels, paraſites, flaterers, loiterers or fooles. Firſt mee ſeemeth, that a man ought not to think that fooles are capable to geeue counſayle, ſince they haue it not for them ſelues: for it ſhould bee great foly to vſe men as ſages, which of their owne will haue made them ſelues fooles. The ſecond, mee ſeemeth that it is a vaine thinge to think, that the ieſters ſhould ſerue as ſeruants: for theſe vnhappy people, to fly tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle onely, haue taken vpon them this office ſo ſclaunderous.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly it ſemeth to bee a ſhamefaſt thing, and of great inconuenyence, that any noble and ſage? man ſhould determine, to haue any flatterer, or ieſter for his famylyar frend: for ſuch ought not, nor cannot bee counted among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true frends, ſince they loue vs not for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertue wee poſſeſſe, but for the goods which wee haue. Fourthly mee thinketh it a vayne thing to think, that vnder the colour of pouerty it ſhould bee iuſt, to geeue meat to ieſters, or loyterers: for wee cannot ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuch are poore for that they want ryches, but that folly a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boundeth in them. Since therefore a man is defamed to haue ſuch ieſters, flatterers, and loyterers for frends, and that for beeing ſeruants they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hable, and with out witt to aſk them counſayle: mee thynketh it is a great
<pb facs="tcp:21411:261"/>
folly, to ſpend hys goods on ſuch loyterers. For as their intencions to the gods onely are manifeſt, and to men ſecret: ſo their is nothing wherin the good doo approue and manyfeſt their intencions to bee good, or euyl, more then in the woordes which they ſpeake, &amp; in the companies which they keepe.</p>

For I eſteeme more the bones, which the earth doo couer: then the riches, which groweth theron. If thou haſt not loſt the ſence of ſmelling, as that Ile doth ſauoure vnto mee of ſages: ſo doth Rome ſtynk of fooles. For, for the time it is leſſe payne, to endure the ſtink of the beaſt: then to heare the woordes of a foole. When the warres of <hi>Aſia</hi> were ended, I returned home by that yle, wherin I viſited al the lyuing people, and al the graues of the dead philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. And for, a trueth, I tel thee Lambert, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> that iourney was veri truble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vnto mee: for here in my perſon endured much payne, on the land I ſuffered dyuers daungers, and on the ſea I ſaw my ſelfe in ſondry perils. In the city of <hi>Corinthe</hi> (where thou art reſident at this preſent) in the middeſt of the market place, thou ſhalt finde the graue of the philoſopher <hi>Panimio,</hi> to whom the ſtreight frendſhip auayled litel, which hee had with <hi>Ouide:</hi> but the enmity greatly endomaged him which hee had with <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the emperor.

Wel, by the faith of an honeſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſwere vnto thee, that thou ſhalt fynde al true which I haue told thee.

And it is true alſo, that in all that time my eyes were as much wet with water, as their bones were couered with earth. Theſe philoſophers were not bany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, for myſcheues by their perſons committed, nor for ſclaunders they had doon in the common wealths: but beecauſe the deeds of our fathers deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that they ſhoold bee taken from their company, and wee their chyldren were not woorthy, to haue the bones of ſo famous, and renowmed ſages in our cuſtody. I cannot tell, if the enuy I haue to that Ile bee greater, or the pyty I haue of this miſerable Rome: for the one is immortall by the graues of the dead, and the other is defamed with the lyfe of the lyuing.</p>
                     <p>I deſire thee hartely as a frend, and doo commaund thee as a ſeruaunt, that thou keepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pryuyleges which I geeue to that Ile, without breakyng any one. For it is very iuſt, that ſuch cyties peopled with ſuch dead, ſhould bee priuileged of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyuing. By this Centurion, thou ſhalt know al things which are chaunced amongſt the priſoners.</p>
                     <p>For if I ſhould wryte al the whole matter vnto thee as it was doon: I e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſure thee, vnto mee it would bee much paine to write it, &amp; to thee great trouble to rede it. It ſuffyceth preſently to ſay that the day of the great ſolempnitie of the mother <hi>Berecinthe</hi> a ſclaunderer aroſe in Rome by the occaſion of theſe ieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſcoffers, and loyterers: and by the fayth of a good man, I ſweare vnto thee, that the blood which was ſhed through the places, ſurmounted the wine which was drunk at the feaſt. And think not that which I ſay to bee lytel that the blood which was ſhed, ſurmounted the wine that was drunk.</p>
                     <p>For as thou now knoweſt, the Citezins are come to ſo great folly: that hee which was on that day moſt drunk, they ſayd that hee had offred vnto the Gods greateſt ſacrifyces. I am yet afrayd, to remember the crueltyes which that day I ſaw with my owne eyes: but I am much more aſhamed of that which they talk of vs in ſtraunge realms. For the noble and woorthy harts, doo not count it ſo much to receiue a great wound: as to take it of a cowardly man. There is great dyfference beetweene the netts, wher with they take brydes, and no leſſe is there beetwene the hooks, wherwith they take fyſh. I meane that the knife which cutteth the fleſh, dyffereth much from the knife which hurteth the hart. For the hurts of the body, with ſurgions may bee healed: but the gods onely are the phiſicions of the peryls of the hart.</p>

One thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forteth mee, that ſince Rome &amp; her Romayns doo not reioyce them ſelues but with fooles: that ſhee and her children bee not punyſhed, but by the hands of fooles. I think not that in this caſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gods doo any wrong, if Rome which laughed through mockry at the players: doo weepe one day with the loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in good earneſt. Thou mightſt demaund mee Lambert, ſince wee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to maintayne equal iuſtice w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al: wherfore wee doo diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſemble many offences which others haue doon in earneſt: and yet wee wyll not pardon thoſe ieſters, ſince al that they haue inuented, was for mirth and paſtyme? I promiſe thee, thoughe their offences were great in deed: yet I doo not baniſh them ſo much for the blood they haue ſhed, as for the good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which they haue peruerted. Once agayne I retourn to ſay vnto thee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue not banyſhed them ſo much for beecauſe they were occaſion of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: as to bee teachers of all lyes. Without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paryſon, greater is the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to the gods, and greater is the domage to the common wealth to take away (as theſe loyterers haue doon) the ſenſes of wyſe men: then that which the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers doo, to take life from their enemies. The end of theſe ieſters, ſcoffers, iuglers, idell men, and thoſe kind of raſcalles, is always to perſwade men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſpeak continually in mockries, treat continually in mockries, and to ridde them of their ſorows, and al this is but to deceyue them of their goods. In the which caſe I ſay, and ſo pleaſed it the gods, that they ſhoold content them ſelues with the goods, without robbing vs of our wiſedom. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Scipio</hi> the Affrican had ended the warres of Affrike, hee went through Rome acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I let thee weete <hi>Scipio,</hi> that thy life had not then ſo much perill among thy enemyes: as thy honour hath at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent among fooles. Theſe woords were very good, though they were euell receyued, of humayne malice.

                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders which ariſe in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. Since wee know not but to labor, and the loyterers know not but to loyter, I would ſay, that with more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they might ſay that wee were not ſage: then wee might ſay that they are fooles. For wrongfully are they called fooles, which by craft eat the ſwette of others: Seeing the litle regard wee haue to theſe loyterers, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring how much wee preſume: by the fayth of a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſweare vnto thee <hi>Lamberte,</hi> that with greater reaſon they ſhould mock our woorks: then wee others ſhould laugh at their woords. For they profite more with our goods, then wee doo of their folly. In the, CCxli. of the foundacion of Rome a ſore plague came into Italy. The which beeing ended, they determined to tel not the thouſands of menn that were dead: but the ſmall nomber of thoſe which remained aliue. Rome afterwards beeing ſo ſolitary, and Italy ſo deſolate, onely to reioyce the people, and to the end the cities ſhould not remayn vnha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, the firſt theathers were inuented, and then firſt were theſe players re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. For vntill that time the Romayns knew no other thing, but to offer ſacrifice to their gods in the temples: and to fight againſt their enemies in the feeldes. O lamentable thing to heare, that this plague laſted only .xxiiii. moneths, and the rage and folly of theſe players, and idel men, hath endured more then .iiii. yeres. Would to the immortal gods, that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> plague had ended thoſe few which remayn: beefore this curſed generation had brought ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable cuſtomes into Rome. For much better had it been for our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rome, that ſhee had wanted inhabiters, than ſuch raſkals ſhould haue come and dwelled therein. I know well <hi>(Lambert)</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe parſons doo great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly complaine of mee, and that the complaynts which they doo in the beegin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſhal not haue an end there: but I care not much for the complaints of the euel w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> doo ſerue for no other thing but to reproue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſtices which are mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſtred vnto them by the good.

                     <p>Since the time I was borne, I neuer ſaw any thing leſſe profitable in the common wealth, nor more vaine, neyther worſe inuencions, nor colder recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations then theſe are, which theſe ieſters, players, and iuglers doo inuent.</p>

cruelty can there bee in Rome, then that the ſenatours and rich men geeue more to a player, for a ſong which hee ſingeth in one houre, then they doo to the ſeruaunts for ſeruing them a whole yeare? What greater theft can there bee than this, that the gariſons which are in <hi>Illiria</hi> want: and players, ieſters iuglers, flatterers, and loyterers, in Rome haue to much? What greater ſha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e can Rome receyue then this, when it ſhall bee ſayd in time to come, that iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, players, paraſites, ieſters, and flatterers, haue wonne more with their iugling, playing, ieſting and flattering: then diuers captayns with their we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and triumphs? Beehold therfore <hi>Lambert,</hi> what difference ther is bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene captayns, and loyterers. For when the one went through Rome, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing their follyes from gate to gate: the others went from realme to realm conſuming their goods, aduenturing their liues, fighting againſt the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people, and ſhedding their own proper blood.</p>
                     <p>And in the hindermoſt parte of <hi>Spaine,</hi> when thoſe of <hi>Seuill</hi> had warre with the <hi>Gaditanes,</hi> it chaunced that euen in the middeſt of the time thoſe of <hi>Seuil</hi> wanted mony, and, ii. paraſites offred them ſelues for .ii. yeares to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne the warrs, with their own proper goods: ſo that with the riches of two fooles: many wiſe men were ouercome. When the <hi>Amazones</hi> were ladies of <hi>Aſia,</hi> then they buylt the great temple of the goddeſſe <hi>Diana.</hi> And as the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories account, onely with that they tooke away from a player, was buylt this noble temple. If the hiſtories of the Egiptians doo not deceiue mee, king <hi>Cadmus,</hi> who with a .100. gates buylt the great city of <hi>Thebes,</hi> for ſuch a buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſo high and monſtrous a city, all his ſubiects together gaue him not ſo much, as two paraſits did alone. When the good emperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi> renewed the walles of Rome, and made them of hard ſtone, which beefore that tyme were only of earth and brick, towards ſuch a coſtly woork, hee had more of two paraſites which were drowned, then of al the city beeſide. I beeing in the city of <hi>Corinthe,</hi> ſaw an auncient tomb, wherin the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſay theyr firſt king was buried. And the hiſtoriographers ſay that this king was a great wroſtler, other ſay hee was a paraſite, others ſay hee was a iugler, but how ſo euer it was, hee was firſt a ieſter, and obtained a realme in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.

                        <hi>CLeobolus</hi> and <hi>Biton</hi> were the ſonnes of a renowmed woman, the whych was Nunne to the goddeſſe <hi>Iuno:</hi> and when the day of that ſolemne feaſt was celebrated, her children prepared a chariot, wherin their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhoold go to the temple. For the Greekes had this cuſtom, the day that the prieſts went to offer any ſacrifyces, eyther they were caried on mennes armes, or in chariots. They adourned their temples ſo well, they eſteemed their ſacrifices ſo much, and did ſo much honor their prieſts: that if any prieſt did ſet his foote on the ground, that day they did not permit him to offer any ſacrifices to the gods. It chaunced as this Nunne went in her charyot, and her children <hi>Cleobolus</hi> and <hi>Biton</hi> with her, the beaſts which drew the chariot, ſodainly fel down dead .x. myles from the temple of the goddeſſe <hi>Iuno.</hi> The children ſeeing the beaſts dead, and that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother coold not goe a foote, and that the chariot was al ready, and that there were no beaſts to draw it: they (as louing children) determined to yoke them ſelues, and draw the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot as if they had been dome beaſts. And as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother caried the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> .ix. moneths in her womb, ſo did they draw her in the chariot .x. myles. Now for that they paſſed through infinit nomberz of men, to the great feaſt of the goddeſſe <hi>Iuno:</hi> euery man ſeeing <hi>Cleobolus</hi> and <hi>Biton</hi> yoked in the chariot lyke beaſts, were greatly amazed, ſaying that theſe two childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſerued with great rewards to bee recompenſed. And truely they ſayd iuſtly, and ſo the deſerued it. For they deſerued as much to bee prayſed for the example which they ſhewed to all children to reuerence their parents: as for carying their mother in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot to the temple. So after that the feaſt was ended, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng how to requite the benefite of her children, with many teares beeſought the goddeſſe <hi>Iuno,</hi> that ſhee with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other gods woold bee contented, to geeue her .ii. children the beſt thing that the gods coold geeue to their frends. The goddeſſe <hi>Iuno</hi> aunſwered her, that ſhee was contented to require the other gods, and that they woold doo it. And the reward was, that for this noble fact the gods ordeyned, that <hi>Cleobolus</hi> and <hi>Biton</hi> ſhoold ſleepe one day well, and in the morning when they ſhoold wake, they ſhoold dye. The mother pitifully beewayling the death of her children: and complaining of the gods, the goddeſſe <hi>Iuno</hi> ſayd vnto her. Thou haſt no cauſe why to complayn, ſins wee haue geeuen thee that thou haſt demaunded: and haſt demaunded that which wee haue geeuen thee. I am a goddeſſe, and thou art my ſeruaunt &amp; therefore the gods haue geeuen to thy children the thing, which they count moſt deare, which is death. For the greateſt reuenge which amongſt vs gods wee can take of our enemies, is to let them liue long: and the beſt thing that wee keepe for our frends, is to make them dye quickly.</p>
                     <p>The auctor of this hiſtory is called <hi>Hiſearchus</hi> in his politikes, and <hi>Cicero</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:264"/>
in his firſt book of his <hi>Tuſculanes.</hi> In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ile of <hi>Delphos,</hi> where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Oracle of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god <hi>Apollo</hi> was, there was a ſumptuous temple, the which for want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paracion fell down to the ground as often times it chaunceth to high &amp; ſump<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuous buyldings, which from tyme to tyme are not repayred. For if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles, dungeons, caſtels, and ſtrong houſes coold ſpeak, as well woold they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playn for that they doo not renew them, as the old men doo for that wee doo not cheriſh them. <hi>Triphon,</hi> and <hi>Agamendo,</hi> were two noble perſonages of Greece, and counted for ſage and rich men: the which went vnto the temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and buylt it new agayn, as well with the labor of their perſons, as with the great expenſes of their goods. When the buylding was atchiued, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god <hi>Apollo</hi> ſaid vnto them, that hee remembred well their good ſeruice, wherefore hee woold they ſhoold demaund him any thing in reward of their trauail, and with a good will it ſhoold bee graunted. For the gods vſe, for a little ſeruice, to geeue a great reward. <hi>Triphon,</hi> and <hi>Agamendo,</hi> aunſwered vnto the god <hi>Apollo,</hi> that for their good will, for their trauell, and for their expenſes, they demaunded no other reward: but that it woold pleaſe him to geeue them the beſt thing that might bee geeuen vnto man, and that vnto them were moſt profit: ſaying, that the miſerable men haue not the power to eſchew the euill, nor wiſedom to chooſe the good. The god <hi>Apollo</hi> aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that hee was contented to pay them their ſeruice which they had doon, and to grant them that which they had demaunded. By reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Triphon,</hi> and <hi>Agamendo</hi> hauing dyned, ſodeinly at the gates of the temple fell down dead. So that the reward of their trauell, was to pluck them out of their miſery. The end to declare theſe two examples is to thend that al mortal men may know, that there is nothing ſo good in this world as to haue an end of this lyfe: and though to loſe it there bee no ſauor, yet at the leaſt ther is profit. For wee woold reproue a traueler of great fooliſhnes, if ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the way hee woold ſing: and after at his iorneys end hee ſhoold bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to weepe. Is not hee ſimple, which is ſory for that hee is comen into the hauen? is not hee ſimple, that geeueth the battell, and fighteth for that hee hath got the victory? Is not hee ſtubbern, which is in great diſtreſſe, and is angry to bee ſuccored? Therefore, more fooliſh, ſimple, and ſtubbern is hee, which traueleth to dye, and is loth to meet with death. For death is the true refuge, the perfect health, the ſure hauen, the whole victory, the fleſh wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bones, fyſh wythout ſcales, and corne without ſtraw: Fynally after death wee haue nothing to beewail, and much leſſe to deſire.</p>
                     <p>In the tyme of <hi>Adrian</hi> the emperor, a philoſopher called <hi>Secundus</hi> (beeing marueilouſly learned) made an oration at the funerall of a noble Romayn matrone (a kinſwoman of the emperors) who ſpake exceeding much euill of lyfe, &amp; marueilous much good of death. And when the emperor demaunded him what death was, the philoſopher anſwered: Death is an eternal ſleepe, a diſſolucion of the body, a terror of the rich, a deſire of the poore, a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritable, a pilgrymage vncertain, a theef of men, a kynde of ſleaping, a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of lyfe, a ſeperacion of the lyuing, a company of the dead, a reſolution of all a reſt of trauels, and the end of all ydle deſires. Fynally death is the ſcourge of all euyll, and the cheef reward of the good.</p>
                     <p>Truely this philoſopher ſpake very well, &amp; hee ſhoold not doo euill, which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21411:264"/>
profoundly woold conſider that hee had ſpoken. <hi>Seneca</hi> in an epiſtle decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, of a philoſopher whoſe name was <hi>Baſſus,</hi> to whom when they demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what euil a man can haue in death, ſince men feare it ſo much, hee aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. If any domage or fear is in him who dyeth, it is not for the fear of death: but for the vyce of him which dieth. Wee may agree to that the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſayd, that euen as the deaf can not iudge harmony, nor the blynd co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: ſo lykewiſe they cannot ſay euill of death, in eſpecially hee which neuer taſted it. For of all thoſe which are dead, none returned again to complayn of death: and of theſe few that lyue, all complayn of lyfe. If any of the dead returned hyther to ſpeak with the liuing, and as they haue proued it, ſo they woold tel vs. If there were any harm in ſecret death, it were reaſon to haue ſome fear of death? But though a man that neuer ſaw, hard, felt, nor taſted death, dooth ſpeak euil of death, ſhoold wee therefore fear death? Thoſe ought to haue doon ſome euil in their life, whych doo fear and ſpeak euill of death. For in the laſt hour, in the ſtreight iudgement, the good ſhalbee kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, and the euill diſcouered. There is no prince nor knight, rich nor poore, whole nor ſick, lucky nor vnlucky, whych I ſee with their vocacions to bee contented, ſaue only the dead: which in their graues are in peace and reſt, and are neyther couetous, proud, negligent, vayn, ambitious, nor diſſolute. So that the ſtate of the dead ought to bee beſt, ſince wee ſee none therin to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil contented. And ſince therefore thoſe which are poore, doo ſeeke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to enrich them ſelues, thoſe which are ſad, doo ſeeke wherby to reioice, and thoſe which are ſick, doo ſeeke to bee healed, why is it, that thoſe which haue ſuch fear of death, doo ſeeke ſome remedy againſt that fear? In this caſe I woold ſay, that hee which will not fear to dye, let him vſe him ſelf well to liue. For the giltles taketh away fear from death. The deuine <hi>Plato</hi> demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Socrates</hi> how hee beehaued him ſelf in life, and how hee woold beehaue him ſelf in death, hee aunſwered. I let thee weete, that in youth I haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueled to liue wel, and in age I haue ſtudied to dye well: and ſith my life hath been honeſt, I hope my death ſhalbee ioyful. And though I haue had ſorow to lyue, I am ſure I ſhall haue no payn to dye. Truely theſe woords were woorthy of ſuch a man. Men of ſtout harts ſuffer maruelouſly, when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſwet of their trauel is not rewarded, when they are faithful, and their reward an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth nothing to their true ſeruice: when for their good ſeruices, their frends beecome vnthankful to them, when they are woorthy honor, and that they preferre them to honorable rome and office. For the noble and valyant harts, doo not eſteeme to loſe the reward of their labor: but think much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnes, when a man dooth not acknowledge their trauel. O happy are they that dye: For without inconuenience and without payn euery man is, in hys graue. For in this tribunall, iuſtice to all is ſo equally obſerued: that in the ſame place where wee haue deſerued life, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame place wee merited death. There was neuer nor neuer ſhall bee iudge ſo iuſt, nor in iuſtice ſo vpryght, that geeueth reward by weight, &amp; payn by meaſure: but ſomtimes they cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice the innocent, and abſolue the gylty, they vex the faultleſſe, and diſſemble with the culpable. For litle auayleth it the plaintif to haue good iuſtice: if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience want to the iudge that ſhoold miniſter. Truely it is not ſo in death, but all ought to count them ſelues happy. For hee w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſhall haue good iuſtice,

ſhalbee ſure on his part to haue the ſentence. When great <hi>Cato</hi> was cenſor in Rome, a famous Romayn dyed, who ſhewed at his death a merueylous courage: and when the Romayns praiſed him for that hee had ſo great vertu, and for the woords hee had ſpoken, <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſour laughed at that they ſayd, for that they praiſed him. And hee beeing demaunded the cauſe of his laughter, aunſwered. Ye maruell at that I laugh, and I laugh at that you maruel. For the perils and trauels conſidered wherein wee liue, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherein wee dye. I ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is no more needful to haue vertue &amp; ſtrength to liue, then courage to dye. The aucthor heereof is <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Apotheg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.</hi> Wee cannot ſay but that <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſour ſpake as a wiſe man, ſince dayly wee ſee, ſhamefaſt and vertuous perſons ſuffer hunger, cold, thriſt, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, pouerty, inconuenience, ſorows, enmities, and miſhaps: of the w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> things wee were better to ſee the end in one day, then to ſuffer them euery hour.</p>
                     <p>For it is leſſe euill to ſuffer an honeſt death: then to endure a miſerable lyfe. O how ſmall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration haue men to think, that they ought to dye but once. Since the trueth is, that the day when wee are born, and comen in to the world is the beeginning of our death: and the laſt day is when wee doo ceaſe to liue. If death bee no other but an ending of lyfe, then reaſon perſwadeth vs to think, that our infancy dyeth, our chyldhod dyeth, our manhod dyeth, &amp; our age ſhall dye: whereof wee may conſequently conclude, that wee dye eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yere, euery day, euery hour, and euery moment. So that thinking to lead a ſure lyfe, wee taſt a new death. I know not why men fear ſo much to dye, ſince that from the time of their birth, they ſeeke none other thing but death. For time neuer wanted to any man to dye, neither I knew any man that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer failed of this way. <hi>Seneca</hi> in an epiſtle declareth that as a Romain wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lamented the death of a child of hers, a philoſopher ſaid vnto her: Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man why beewayleſt thou thy child? ſhe aunſwered I weepe beecauſe hee hath liued .xxv. yeres, &amp; I woold hee ſhoold haue liued till fyfty. For amongſt vs mothers, wee loue our children ſo hartely, that wee neuer ceaſe to bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them, nor yet end to beewayl them. Then the Philoſopher ſaid. Tell mee I pray thee woman, why dooſt thou not complayn of the gods, beecauſe they created not thy ſonne many yeres beefore hee was born: as well as thou complayneſt that they haue not let him liue .l. yeres? Thou weepeſt, that hee is dead ſo ſoone: and thou dooſt not lament that hee is borne ſo late. I tel thee true woman, that as thou dooſt not lament for the one, no more thou oughtſt to bee ſory for the other. For wythout the determination of the gods, wee can not ſhorten death: and much leſſe lengthen life. So <hi>Plinie</hi> ſayd in an epiſtle, that the cheefeſt law whych the gods haue geeuen to humayn nature was, that none ſhoold haue perpetuall life. For with diſordinat deſire to liue long, wee ſhoold neuer reioice to goe out of this payn. Two philoſophers diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng beefore the great Emperor <hi>Theodoſe,</hi> the one ſayd that it was good to procure death: and the other lykewiſe ſayd, it was a neceſſary thing to hate lyfe. The good <hi>Theodoſe</hi> takyng hym by the hand ſaid. All wee mortalles are ſo extreem in hatyng, and louyng: that vnder the colour to loue, and hate lyfe, wee lead an euyll lyfe. For wee ſuffer ſo many trauels for to preſerue it, that ſometymes it were much better to loſe it. And further hee ſayd, dyuers vayn men are come into ſo great follies, that for fear of death,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:21411:265"/>
they procure to haſten death. And hauing conſideration to this, mee ſeemeth that wee ought not greatly to loue lyfe, nor with deſperation to ſeeke death. For the ſtrong and valiaunt men, ought not to hate lyfe ſo long as it laſteth: nor to bee diſpleaſed with death, when hee commeth. All commended that whych <hi>Theodoſe</hi> ſpake, as <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> ſayth in his lyfe. Let euery man ſpeak what hee will, and let the philoſophers counſell what they liſt, in my poor iudgement, hee alone ſhal receiue death without payn: who long before is prepared to receiue the ſame. For ſodayn death is not only bitter to hym which taſteth it: but alſo it feareth him that hateth it. <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſayd, that in ſuch ſort man ought to liue, as if from hence an hour after hee ſhoold dye.</p>
                     <p>For thoſe men which will haue death beefore their eies, it is vnpoſſible that they geeue place to vain thoughts. In my oppinion, and alſo by the aduyſe of <hi>Apuleius,</hi> it is as much folly to fly from that which wee cannot auoyd: as to deſire that wee cannot attain. And this is ſpoken for thoſe, that woold flye the vyage of death which is neceſſary: and deſire to come agayn which is vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>poſſible. Thoſe that trauell by long ways, if they want any thing, they bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it of their company. If they haue forgotten ought, they returne to ſeeke it at their lodging, or els they write vnto their frends a letter. But I am ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that if wee once dye, they will not let vs return agayn, wee cannot ſpeak, and they will not agree wee ſhall write: but ſuch as they ſhal finde vs, ſo ſhall wee bee iudged. And that which is moſt fearfull of all, the execucion and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is geeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one day. Let princes and great lords beeleeue mee in this. Let them not leaue that vndoon till after their death: which they may doo during their lyfe. And let them not truſt in that they commaund: but in that whiles they liue they doo. Let them not truſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woorks of an other: but in their own good deedes. For in the end, one ſigh ſhalbee more woorth, then all the frends of the world. I counſel, pray, and exhort all wiſe and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, and alſo my ſelf with them, that in ſuch ſort wee liue, that at the hour of death, wee may ſay wee liue. For wee cannot ſay that wee lyue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee liue not well. For all that tyme which without profit wee ſhall liue, ſhall bee counted vnto vs for nothing.</p>

                     <head>¶ Of the death of Marcus Aurelius the Emperor, and how there are few frends which dare ſay the truth to ſick men. Cap. xlix.</head>
                     <p>THe good Emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> now beeing aged, not only for the great yeres hee had: but alſo for the great trauels hee had in the warres endured: It chaunced, that in the .xviii. yere of his Empire, and .lxxii. yeres from the day of his birth, and of the foundation of Rome .v. hundreth xliii. beeing in the warre of <hi>Pannony</hi> (which at this tyme is called <hi>Hungary</hi>) beeſeeging a famous citie called <hi>Vendeliona,</hi> ſodaynly a diſeaſe of the palſey tooke him, which was ſuch, that hee loſt his life, and Rome her Prince, the beſt of lyfe that euer was born therein. Among the heathen princes ſome had more force then hee, other poſſeſſed more ryches then hee, others were as aduenturous as hee, and ſome haue knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as much as hee: but none hath been of ſo excellent and vertuous a lyfe, nor ſo modeſt as hee. For his life bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examined to the vttermoſt, there are many princely vertues to follow, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:21411:266"/>
few vices to reproue. The occaſion of his death was, that going one nyght about his camp, ſodeinly the diſeaſe of the palſey tooke him in his arme: ſo that from thence forward hee coold not put on his gown, nor draw his ſword, and much leſſe cary a ſtaffe. The good emperor beeing ſo loden with yeres, and no leſſe with cares, the ſharp winter approching more and more, great aboundance of water and ſnow fell about the tenis: ſo that an other diſeaſe fell vppon him, called <hi>Litargie,</hi> the which thing much abated his courage, and in his hoaſt cauſed great ſorow. For hee was ſo beeloued of all, as if they had been his own children. After that hee had proued all medicins and remedies that coold bee found, and all other things, which vnto ſo great and mighty princes were accuſtomed to bee doon, hee perceiued in the end, that all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy was paſt. And the reaſon hereof was, beecauſe his ſicknes was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vehement, &amp; he him ſelf very aged, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ayer vnholſom, &amp; aboue al, beecauſe ſorows &amp; cares oppreſſed his hart. Without doubt, greater is the diſeaſe that proceedeth of ſorow, then that which proceedeth of the feuer quartain. And thereof enſueth, that more eaſely is hee cured, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> of corrupt humors is full: then hee w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> with profound thoughts is oppreſſed. The emperor then beeing ſick in his chamber, &amp; in ſuch ſort that hee coold not exerciſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feats of arms: as his men ranne out of their camp to ſcirmidge, &amp; the <hi>Hungarions</hi> in lyke maner to defend, the fight on both parts was ſo cruell, through the great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fution of blood, that neither the hungarion had cauſe to reioyce, nor yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn to bee mery. Vnderſtanding the euil order of his, &amp; ſpecially that .v. of his captains were ſlain in the conflict, &amp; that hee for his diſeaſe coold not bee there in perſon: ſuch ſorows perſed his hart, that although hee deſired foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to haue dyed, yet hee remained two days &amp; three nights, without that hee woold ſee light, or ſpeak vnto any man of his. So that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heat was much, the reſt was ſmall, the ſighs were continuall, and the thirſt very great: the meat lytle, and the ſleepe leſſe, and aboue all his face wrynkled, and his lips very black. Sometimes hee caſt vp his eyes, and another tyme hee wrong his hands: always hee was ſylent, and continually hee ſighed. His tong was ſwollen, that hee coold not ſpit: and his eyes very hollow with weeping. So that it was a great pity, to ſee his death: and no leſſe compaſſion, to ſee the confuſion of his pallace, and the hinderaunce of the warre. Many valiant captains, many noble Romayns, many faithfull ſeruaunts, and many old frends, at all theſe heauines were preſent. But none of them durſt ſpeak to the Emperor <hi>Marke,</hi> partly for that they tooke him to bee ſo ſage, that they knew not what counſel to geeue him: and partly for that they were ſo ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that they coold not refrayn their heauy tears. For the louing and true frends, in their lyfe ought to bee beeloued: and at their death to bee beewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Great compaſſion ought men to haue of thoſe which dye, not for that wee ſee them dye: but beecauſe there are none that telleth them what they ought to doo. Princes and great lords are in greater perill when they dye: then the Plebeyans. For the counſaylour dare not tell vnto his Lord at the hour of death, that which hee knoweth: and much leſſe hee will tell him how hee ought to dye, and what things hee ought to diſcharge whiles hee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue. Many goe to viſit the ſick, that I woold to god they went ſome other where. And the cauſe heereof is, that they ſee the ſick mans eyes hollow,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:21411:266"/>
the fleſh dryed, the arms without fleſh, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> colour enflamed, the ague continu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>all, the payn great, the tong ſwollen, nature conſumed, and beeſydes al this, the houſe deſtroyed: and yet they ſay vnto the ſick man, bee of good cheere, I warrant you, you ſhall liue. As yong men naturally deſire to liue, and as death to all old men is dredfull: ſo though they ſee them ſelues in that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, yet they refuſe no medicine, as though there were great hope of lyfe. And thereof enſueth oftentymes, that the miſerable creatures depart the world, without confeſſing vnto god, and making reſtitutions vnto men.</p>
                     <p>O if thoſe which doo this, knew what euil they doo. For to take away my goods, to trouble my perſon, to blemiſh my good name, to ſclaunder my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, and to reprooue my lyfe, theſe woorks are of cruell enemyes: but to bee occaſion to loſe my ſoul, it is the woorke of the deuill of hell. Certeinly hee is a deuyll, whych deceiueth the ſick with flatteries: and that in ſteede to healp hym to dye well, putteth him in vayn hope of long lyfe.</p>
                     <p>Heerein hee that ſayth it, winneth lyttle: and hee that beeleeueth it, aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureth much. To mortall men it is more meete, to geeue counſels to reform their conſciences with the truth: then to haſard their houſes with lyes. With our frends wee are ſhameleſſe in their life, and alſo baſhfull at their death. The which ought not to bee ſo. For if our fathers were not dead, and that wee did not dayly ſee theſe that are preſent dye: mee thinketh it were a ſhame and alſo a fear, to ſay to the ſick that hee alone ſhoold dye. But ſince thou knowſt as well as hee, and hee knoweth as well as thou, that all doo trauell in this perillous iurney: what ſhame haſt thou to ſay vnto thy frend, that hee is now at the laſt point? If the dead ſhoold now reuyue, how woold they complayn of their frends? And thys for no other cauſe, but for that they woold not geeue them good counſell at their death. For if the ſick man bee my frend, and that I ſee peraduenture hee will dye: why ſhall not I counſell him to prepare him ſelf to dye? Certeinly oftentimes wee ſee by expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that thoſe which are prepared, and are ready for to dye, doo eſcape: and thoſe which think to liue doo periſh. What ſhoold they doo which goe to vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit the ſick? perſwade them that they make their teſtaments, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſinnes, that they diſcharge their conſcience, that they receiue the Communion, and that they doo reconcile them ſelues to their enemies.</p>
                     <p>Certeinly, all theſe things charge not the launce of death, nor cut not the threed of lyfe. I neuer ſaw blyndnes ſo blynd, nor ignoraunce ſo ignorant, as to bee aſhamed to counſell the ſick, that they are bound to doo when they are whole. As wee haue ſayd heere aboue, Princes and great Lords, are thoſe aboue all other that liue and dye moſt abuſedly. And the cauſe is, that as their ſeruaunts haue no harts to perſwade them when they are mery: ſo haue they no audacity to tell them trueth, when they are in peril. For ſuch ſeruaunts care lytle, ſo that their maiſters beequeath them any thing in theyr willes, whether they dye well, or lyue euyll.</p>
                     <p>O what miſery, and pity is it, to ſee a Prince, a Lord, a gentleman, and a rych perſon dye, if they haue no faythfull frend about them, to help them to paſſe that payn? And not wythout a cauſe I ſay, that hee ought to bee a faythfull frend. For many in our lyfe doo gape after our goods, and few at our deaths are ſory for our offences. The wyſe and ſage men,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:267"/>
before nature compelleth them to dye, of their own will ought to dye. That is to weete, that beefore they ſee them ſelues in the pangues of death, they haue their conſciences ready prepared. For if wee count him a foole, whych will paſſe the ſea without a ſhippe: truely wee will not count him wiſe, which taketh his death without any preparacion beefore. What loſeth a wiſe man to haue his will well ordained? in what aduenture of honor is any man bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death, to reconſile him ſelf to his enemies: and to thoſe whom hee hath born hate and malyce? What loſeth hee of his credit, who in his lyfe tyme re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoreth that, which at his death they will commaund him to render? wherein may a man ſhew him ſelf to bee more wiſe, then when willingly hee hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged that, which afterwards by proces they will take from him? O how many princes, &amp; great lords are there, which only not for ſpending one day about their teſtament, haue cauſed their children, and heirs, all the days of their life to bee in trauerſe in the law? So that they ſuppoſing to haue left their children welthy: haue not left them, but for atturneis and counſelers of the law. The true and vnfained Chriſtian, ought euery morning ſo to dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his goods, and correct his lyfe: as if hee ſhoold dye the ſame night. And at night in like maner hee ought ſo to commit him ſelf to god, as if hee hoped for no lyfe vntill morning. For to ſay the truth, to ſuſtein life, there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit trauels: but to meete death, there is but one way. If they will credit my woords, I woold counſell no man in ſuch eſtate to liue: that for any thing in the world, hee ſhoold vndoo him ſelf. The rich and the poore, the great and the ſmall, the gentlemen and the Plebeians, all ſay and ſwear, that of death they are exceeding fearfull. To whom I ſay and affirm, that hee alone fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth death, in whom wee ſee amendment of lyfe. Princes and great lords, ought alſo to bee perfect beefore they bee perfect, to end beefore they end, to dye beefore they dye, and to bee mortified beefore they bee mortified. If they doo this with them ſelues, they ſhall as eaſely leaue their lyfe: as if they cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from one houſe to an other. For the moſt part of men delight to talk w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> leiſure, to drink with leiſure, to eat with leiſure, &amp; to ſleep w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> leiſure: but they dye in haſte. Not without cauſe I ſay they dye in haſte, ſince wee ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſacrament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſupper of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lord in haſte, make their willes by force, &amp; with ſpeed to confeſſe and receiue. So that they take it, and demaund it ſo late, and ſo without reaſon: that often times they haue loſt their ſenſes, and are ready to geeue vp the ſpirit, when they bring it vnto them.</p>
                     <p>What auaileth the ſhip maiſter, after the ſhip is ſonk? what doo weapons auayl, after the battell is loſt? What auaileth pleaſures after men are dead? By that I haue ſpoken, I will demaund, what it auaileth the ſick, beeing he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy with ſleep, and beereft of their ſenſes, to call confeſſors, to whom they confeſſe their ſinnes? Euill ſhal hee bee confeſſed, whych hath no vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng to repent him ſelf. What auayleth it to call the confeſſor, to vnderſtand the ſecret of his conſcience: when the ſick man hath loſt his ſpeach? Let vs not deceiue our ſelues, ſaying in our age, wee will amend heereafter: &amp; make reſtitution at our death. For in myne oppinion, it is not the poynt of wyſe men, nor of good chriſtians, to deſire ſo much tyme to offend: and they wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eſpy any to amend. Woold to god, that the third part of tyme which men occupy in ſinne, were employed about the meditations of death: and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cares
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:21411:267"/>
which they haue to accompliſh their fleſhly luſts, were ſpent in beewayling their filthy ſinnes. I am very ſory at my hart, that thei ſo wickedly paſſe their life, in vyces and pleaſures as if there were no God, to whom they ſhoold render account for their offences. All worldlings willingly doo ſinne, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hope only in age to amend, and at death to repent: but I woold demaund him, that in this hope ſinned, what certeinty hee hath in age of amendment, and what aſſuraunce hee hath to haue long warning beefore hee dye. Since wee ſee by experience, there are mo in nomber which dye yong, then old: it is no reaſon wee ſhoold commit ſo many ſinnes in one day, that wee ſhoold haue cauſe to lament afterwards all the reſt of our lyfe. And afterwards to beewail the ſinnes of our long life, wee deſire no more but one ſpace of an hour. Conſidering the omnipotency of the diuine mercy it ſuffiſeth, ye and I ſay, that the ſpace of an hour is to much, to repent vs of our wicked lyfe: but yet I woold counſell all, ſince the ſinner for to repent taketh but one hour, that that bee not the laſt hour. For the ſighs and repentaunce, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the bottom of the hart, penetrate y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high heauens: but thoſe which come of neceſſity, dooth not perſe the ſeeling of the houſe. I allow and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, that thoſe that viſit the ſick, doo counſell them to examin their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſes, to receiue the communion, to pray vnto god, to forgeeue their enemiez, and to recommend them ſelues to the deuout prayers of the people, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent their ſinnes, fynally I ſay, that it is very good to doo all this: but yet I ſay it is better, to haue doon it beefore. For the diligent and carefull Pirate, prepareth for the tempeſt, when the ſea is calm. Hee that deepely woold conſider, how little the goods of this lyfe are to bee eſteemed: let him goe to ſee a rich man when hee dyeth, and what hee dooth in his bed. And hee ſhall fynd that the wife demaundeth of the poore huſband her dower, the doughter the third part, the other the fift, the child the preheminence of age, the ſonne in law his mariage, the phiſition his duity, the ſlaue his liberty, the ſeruants their wages, the creditors their debts, and the woorſt of all is, that none of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ought to enherit his goods, wil geeue him one glaſſe of water. Thoſe that ſhall here or read this, ought to conſider, that that which they haue ſeene doon at the death of their neighbors: the ſame ſhall come to them, when they ſhalbee ſick at the point of death. For ſo ſoone as the rych ſhutteth his eyes, foorthwith there is great ſtrife beetweene the children for his goods. And this ſtrife is not to vnburthen his ſoule: but whych of them ſhall inherit moſt of his poſſeſſions. In this caſe, I will not my penne trauel any further, ſince both rich and poore, dayly ſee the experience hereof. And in things very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfeſt, it ſuffyſeth only for wyſe men to bee put in memory, without waſting any more tyme to perſwade them. Now the Emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> had a ſecretary very wiſe, and vertuous, through whoſe hands the affairs of the Empire paſſed. And when this ſecretary ſaw his lord, and maiſter, ſo ſick, and almoſt at the hour of death, and that none of his parents nor frends durſt ſpeak vnto him: hee plainly determined to doo his duity, wherein hee ſhewed very well the profound knowledge hee had in wiſdom, and the great good will hee bare to his lord. This ſecretary was called <hi>Panutius,</hi> the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and lyfe of whom, <hi>Sextus Cheronenſis</hi> in the lyfe of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>O</hi> My lord, and maiſter, my tong cannot keepe ſilence, myne eies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not refrayn from bitter tears, nor my hart leaue from fetching ſighes, ne yet reaſon can vſe his duity. For my blood boyleth, my ſinnews are dryed, my pores bee open, my hart dooth faint, and my ſpirit is troubled. And the occaſion of all this is, to ſee that the wholſom counſels which thou geeueſt to others: either thou canſt not, or wil not take for thy ſelf. I ſee thee dye my lord, and I dye for that I cannot remedy thee. For if the gods woold haue graunted mee my requeſt, for the lengthning of thy lyfe one day: I woold geeue willingly my whole life. Whether the ſorow bee true, or fained, it nedeth not I declare vnto thee with woords, ſince thou mayſt manyfeſtly diſcern it by my countenaunce. For my eies with tears are wet, and my hart with ſighs is very heauy. I feele much the want of thy company. I feele much the domage which (of thy death) to the whole common wealth ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. I feele much thy ſorow which in thy pallace ſhal remaine, I feele much for that Rome this day is vndoon: but that which aboue al things dooth moſt torment my hart, is to haue ſeen thee liue as wiſe, and now to ſee thee dye as ſymple. Tell mee I pray thee, my lorde, why doo men learn the Greek tong, trauel to vnderſtand the hebrew, ſweat in the latin, chaunge ſo many maiſters, turn ſo many bookes, and in ſtudy conſume ſo much money and ſo many yeres: if it were not to know how to paſſe lyfe with honor, and take death with pacience? The end why men ought to ſtudy, is to learn to liue well. For there is no truer ſcience in man, then to know how to order his life well. What profiteth it mee to know much, if thereby I take no profit? what profiteth mee to know ſtraunge languages, if I refrain not my tong from other mens matters? what profiteth it to ſtudy many books, if I ſtudy not but to begyle my frends? what profiteth it to know the influence of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtarres, and the courſe of the elements: if I cannot keepe my ſelf from vyces? Fynal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſay, that it lytle auayleth to bee a maiſter of the ſage: if ſecretly hee bee reported to bee a folower of fooles. The cheef of all philoſophy conſiſteth to ſerue god, and not to offend men. I aſk thee, moſt noble prince, what auaileth it the Pilot to know the art of ſayling: and after in a tempeſt by neglygence to periſh? What auayleth it the valyaunt captayn, to talk much of warre: and afterwards hee knoweth not how to geeue the battayl? What auaileth it the guyde, to tell the neereſt way: and afterwards in the midſt to loſe him ſelf.</p>
                     <p>All this w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I haue ſpoken, is ſayd for thee my Lord. For what auayleth it that thou beeing in health, ſhooldſt ſigh for death: ſince now when hee dooth approch, thou weepeſt becauſe thou wooldſt not leaue life? One of the things wherein the wiſe man ſheweth his wiſedom, is to know how to loue, and how to hate. For it is great lightnes (I ſhoold rather ſay folly) to day to loue him, whom yeſterday wee hated: and to morow to ſclaunder him whom this day wee honored. What Prince ſo hygh, or what Plebeyan ſo baſe hath there been, or in the world ſhall euer bee, the whych hath ſo lyttle (as thou) regarded lyfe: and ſo hyghly commended death? What thyngs haue I wrytten (beeing thy Secretary) with my own hand, to dyuers prouynces
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:21411:268"/>
of the world: where thou ſpeakeſt ſo much good of death, that ſometymes y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> madeſt mee to hate lyfe? What was it to ſee that letter which thou wroteſt to the noble Romayn <hi>Claudines</hi> wydow, comforting her of the death of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, which dyed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres? Wherein ſhee aunſwered: That ſhee thought her trouble comfort, to deſerue that thou ſhooldſt write her ſuch a letter.</p>
                     <p>What a pitifull and ſauory letter haſt thou written to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> on the death of thy child <hi>Veriſſimus</hi> thy ſonne ſo much deſired? Whoſe death thou tookeſt ſo, that thou exceedeſt the limits of philoſophy: but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, with thy princely vertues, thou didſt qualify thy wofull ſorows. What ſentences ſo profound, what woords ſo wel couched didſt thou write in that booke enty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>The remedy of the ſorowfull.</hi> the which thou didſt ſend from the warre of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to the Senators of Rome: and that was to comfort them after a ſore plague. And how much profit hath thy doctrin doon ſince? with what new kinde of conſolation haſt thou comforted <hi>Helius Fabatus</hi> the Senſour, when his ſonne was drowned in the ryuer? where I doo remember, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee entred into his houſe, wee found him weeping: and when wee went from thence, wee left him laughing. I doo remember, that when thou wentſt to viſit <hi>Gneus Ruſticus</hi> in his laſt diſeaſe, thou ſpakeſt vnto him ſo effectuouſly, that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the vehemency of thy woords, thou madeſt the tears to run down his cheeks. And I demaunding him the occaſions of his lamentacions, hee ſaid. The emperor my lord hath told mee ſo much euils that I haue wonne, and of ſo much good that I haue loſt, that if I weepe, I weepe not for lyfe which is ſhort, but for death which is long. The man whom aboue all thou haſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, was <hi>Torquatus,</hi> whom thou didſt obey as thy father, and ſeruedſt as thy maiſter. This thy faithfull frend beeing ready to dy, and deſyring yet to liue, thou ſendſt to offer ſacrifices to the gods, not for that they ſhoold graunt him lyfe: but that they ſhoold haſten his death. Herewith I beeing aſtonied, thy nobleneſſe to ſatiſfy my ignoraunce, ſaid vnto mee in ſecret theſe woords.</p>
                     <p>Maruel not <hi>Panutius,</hi> to ſee mee offer ſacrifyces to haſten my frends death: and not to prolong his life. For there is nothing that the faithfull frend ought ſo much to deſyre to his true frend: as to ſee him ridde from the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels of this earth, and to enioy the pleaſures of heauen. Why thinkeſt thou moſt noble prince, that I reduce all theſe things to thy memory, but for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund thee how it is poſſible, that I which haue hard thee ſpeak ſo well of death, doo preſently ſee thee ſo vnwilling to leaue life? ſince the gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund it, thy age willeth it, thy diſeaſe dooth cauſe it, thy feeble nature dooth permit it, the ſinfull Rome dooth deſerue it, and the fickle fortune agreeth, that for our great miſery thou ſhooldſt dye. Why therfore ſigheſt thou ſo much for to dye? The trauels whych of neceſſity muſt needes come, wyth ſtout hart ought to bee receiued. The cowardly hart falleth beefore hee is beaten down: but the ſtout and valyaunt ſtomack in greateſt perill, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth moſt ſtrength. Thou art one man, and not two, thou oughtſt one death to the gods, and not two: why wilt thou therefore beeyng but one, pay for two? and for one only lyfe, take two deaths?</p>
                     <p>I mean that beefore thou endeſt lyfe, thou dyeſt for pure ſorow. After that thou haſt ſayled, and in the ſayling thou haſt paſſed ſuch perill, when the gods doo render thee in the ſafe hauen, once agayn thou wilt run in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raging
<pb facs="tcp:21411:269"/>
ſea, wher thou ſcapeſt the victory of lyfe, and thou dyeſt with the ambuſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of death. Lxii. yeres haſt thou fought in the field, and neuer turned thy back: and feareſt thou now beeing encloſed in the graue? haſt thou not paſſed the pykes, and bryers, wherein thou haſt been encloſed: and now thou trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt, beeing in the ſure way? Thou knoweſt what dommage it is long to liue, and now thou douteſt of the profit of death which enſueth. It is now many yeres, ſince death and thou haue been at defiaunce, as mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and now to lay thy hands on thy weapons, thou flyeſt and turneſt thy back. Lxii. yeres are paſt, ſince thou were bent agaynſt fortune: and now thou cloſeſt thy eyes, when thou oughtſt ouer her to tryumph. By that I haue told thee I mean, that ſince wee doo not ſee thee take death willyngly at this preſent: wee doo ſuſpect that thy lyfe hath not in tymes paſt been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good. For the man which hath no deſire to appeere beefore the gods: it is a token hee is loden with vyces. What meaneſt thou, moſt noble prince, why weepeſt thou as an infant, and complaineſt as a man in diſpaire? If thou weepeſt beecauſe thou dieſt, I aunſwer thee, that thou laughedſt as much when thou liuedſt. For of too much laughing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life, proceedeth much wayling at the death. Who hath always for his heritage, appropriated the places beeing in the common wealth? The vnconſtancy of the mynd, who ſhalbee ſo hardy to make ſteddy? I mean that all are dead, all dye, and al ſhal dye: and among all wilt thou alone lyue? Wilt thou obtayn of the gods, that which maketh them gods? That is to weete, that they make thee immortall, as them ſelues? Wilt thou alone haue by priuiledge, that which the gods haue by nature? My youth demaundeth thy age what thing is beſt, or to ſay better, which is leſſe euill: to dye well, or to lyue euill. I doubt that any man may attayn to the means to lyue well, according to the continuall &amp; variable troubles whych dayly wee haue accuſtomed to cary beetweene our hands, always ſuffring hunger, cold, thirſt, care, diſpleaſures, temptacions, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, euil fortunes, ouerthrows, and diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Thys cannot bee called lyfe, but a long death: and with reaſon wee will call this lyfe death, ſince a thouſand tymes wee hate lyfe. If an auncient man did make a ſhew of his lyfe, from tyme hee is come out of the intrailes of his mother, vntill the tyme hee entreth into the bowels of the earth, and that the body woold declare all the ſorows that hee hath paſſed, and the hart diſcouer all the ouerthrows of fortune, which hee hath ſuffered: I immagin the gods woold maruell, and men woold wonder at the body whych hath endured ſo much, and the hart whych hath ſo greatly diſſembled.</p>
                     <p>I take the Greekes to bee more wiſe, whych weepe when their children bee borne, and laugh when the aged dye: then the Romayns whych ſyng when the children are borne, and weepe when the old men dye. Wee haue much reaſon to laugh, when the old men dye, ſince they dye to laugh: and with greater reaſon wee ought to weepe, when the children are borne, ſince they are borne to weepe.</p>

O if it pleaſed the immortall gods, that as I oftentimes haue hard the diſputacions of this matter: ſo now that thow cooldſt therewith profit. But I am ſory that to the ſage, and wiſe man, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile ſometimes (or for the moſt part) wanteth. None ought to cleue ſo much to his own opinion, but ſometimes hee ſhoold folow the counſaile of the thyrd parſon. For the man which in all things will follow his own aduiſe, ought wel to bee aſſured, that in al, or the moſt part, hee ſhall erre. O my lord Mark, ſith thou art ſage, liuely of ſpirit, of great experience and auncient, didſt not thou think, that as thou hadſt buried many, ſo like wiſe ſome ſhould burie thee? What imaginacions were thine to think, that ſeeing the end of their days, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould not ſee the end of thy yeares? Since thou dieſt rych, honourably accompanied, old, and aboue all, ſeeing thou dieſt in the ſeruice of the common wealth, why feareſt thou to enter into thy graue? Thou haſt always beene a frend as much to know things paſt: as thoſe which were hid and kept ſecret. Sins thou haſt proued what honors, and diſhonors doo deſerue, ryches and pouerty, proſperity and aduerſity, ioy and ſorow, loue and feare, vices &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: mee ſeemeth that nothing remayneth to know, but that it is neceſſarye to know what death is. And alſo I ſweare vnto thee (moſt noble lord) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thow ſhalt learn more in one hour, what death is: then in a hundreth years what life meaneth. Since thou art good, and preſumeſt to bee good, and haſt lyued as good, is it not better that thow dye, &amp; goe with ſo many good: then that thow ſcape, and liue amongſt ſo many euill? That thou feeleſt death, I maruell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, for thou art a man: but I doo maruail that thou diſſembleſt it not, ſince thou art diſcrete. Many things doo the ſage men feele, which inwardly doo oppreſſe their hart: but outwardly they diſſemble them, for the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. If all the poyſon which in the ſorowfull hart is wrapped, were in ſmall peeces in the feeble fleſh ſcattered: then the walles woold not ſuffice to rubbe, neither the nayles to ſcratch vs. What other thing is death, but a trap or doore where with to ſhut the ſhop, wherein all the miſeries of this wofull lyfe are vendible? What wrong or preiudice doo the gods vnto vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they cal vs bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: but from an old decaied houſe, to chaunge vs to a new builded pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace? And what other thing is the graue, but a ſtrong fort, wherein wee ſhut our ſelues from the aſſaults of lyfe, &amp; broyles of fortune? Truely, wee ought to bee more deſirous of that wee fynd in death, then of that wee leaue in lyfe. If <hi>Helia Fabricia</hi> thy wife doo greeue thee, for that thou leaueſt her yong, doo not care. For ſhee preſently hath litle care of the perill, wherein thy lyfe depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. And in the end, when ſhee ſhall know of thy death, ſhee will bee nothing greued. Trouble not thy ſelf for that ſhee is left widow. For yong women (as ſhee is) which are maried with old men (as thou) when their huſbands dye: they haue their eies on that they can robbe, and their harts on them whom they deſire to mary. And ſpeaking with due reſpect, when with their eies they outwardly ſeeme moſt for to beewaile: then with their harts inwardly doo they moſt reioyce. Deceyue not thy ſelf in thinking that the empreſſe thy wife is yong, and that ſhee ſhal fynd none other Emperor with whom agayn ſhee may mary. For ſuch, and the like, will chaunge the cloth of gold, for gow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſkynnes. I mean, that they woold rather the yong ſhepeheard in the
<pb facs="tcp:21411:270"/>
field: then the old emperour in his royall pallace. If thou takeſt ſorow for the children whom thou leaueſt, I know not why thou ſhooldſt do ſo? For truely yf it greeue thee now, for that thou dyeſt: they are more diſpleaſed, for that thow lyueſt. The ſonne that deſireth not the death of his father, may bee counted the onely <hi>Phenix</hi> of this world, for if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father bee poore, he wiſheth him dead for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee is not maintained, &amp; if hee bee rich, hee deſireth his death to enherit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Sins therefore it is true (as in deede it is) it ſeemeth not wiſedome that they ſing, &amp; thou weepe. If it greue thee to leaue theſe goodly pallaces, &amp; theſe ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous buildings, deceiue not thy ſelf therein. For by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god <hi>Iupiter</hi> I ſweare vnto thee, that ſince that death dooth finiſh thee, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of .lxii. yeares: tyme ſhal conſume theſe ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous buildings in leſſe then xl. If it greeue thee to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of thy frends, &amp; neighbors, for them alſo take as litle thought, ſins for thee they wil not take any at all. For amongſt the other compaſſions y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ought to haue of the dead, this is true, that ſcarcely they are buryed, but of their frends &amp; neighbors they are forgotten. If thou takeſt great thought for that thou wilt not dye, as the other emperors of Rome are dead: mee ſeemeth that thou oughtſt allſo to caſt this ſorow from thee. For thou knowſt ryght wel, that Rome hath accuſtomed to bee ſo vnthankful to thoſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſerue her: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the great <hi>Scipio</hi> alſo, woold not bee buryed therein. If it greeue thee to dye, to leaue ſo great a ſeignory, as to leaue the empire: I can not think that ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity bee in thy head. For temperat, &amp; repoſed men, when they eſcape from ſemblable offices, do not think that they loſe honor: but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they bee free, of a tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome charge. Therefore if none of al theſe things moue thee to deſire lyfe, what ſhould let thee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> through thy gates enter not death? it greeueth men to dye for one of theſe two things, eyther for the loue of thoſe they leaue beehynd them, or for the feare of that they hope. Sins therefore there is nothing in this lyfe worthy of loue, nor any things in death why wee ſhoold feare: why doo me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feare to dye? According to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauy ſighs y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> fetcheſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bitter tears thou ſhe deſt, &amp; according alſo to the great payn thou ſheweſt, for my part I think: that the thing in thy thought moſt forgotten was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gods ſhoold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund thee to pay this debt. For admit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their life ſhal end, yet no man thinketh y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> death wil come ſo ſoone. For that men think neuer to dye, they neuer beeginne their faults to amend: ſo that both life &amp; fault haue end in the graue togethers. Knowſt not thou (moſt noble prince) that after the long night, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moiſt morning? Dooſt thou not know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after the moyſt morning, there commeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cleere ſunne? Knowſt not thou, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after the cleare ſunne, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the cloudy ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Dooſt thou not know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after the dark myſt, there commeth extream heat? And that after the heat, cometh the horrible thunders? &amp; after the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the ſodeyn lightnings? &amp; that after the perilous lightnings, commeth the terrible hayle? Fynally I ſay, that after the tempeſteous &amp; troubleſome time, commonly commeth cleare &amp; faire weather. The order that time hath, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke him ſelf cruel, &amp; gentill: the ſelf ſame ought men to haue to liue &amp; dye. For after the infancy, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth chyldhod, after chyldhod commeth youth, after youth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth age, &amp; after age, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fearfull death: Finally after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fearful death, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſure life. Oftentimes I haue read, &amp; of thee not ſeldome hard, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gods onely w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> had no beginning, ſhall haue alſo no endyng. Therefore mee thinketh (moſt noble prince) that ſage men ought not to deſire to lyue long:
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:21411:270"/>
For men which deſire to liue much, eyther it is for that they haue not felt the trauailes paſt, beecauſe they haue been fooles: or for that they deſire more ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, to geeue them ſelues to vices. Thou mightſt not complayn of that, ſins they haue not cut thee in the flower of the herb, nor taken thee greene from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tree, nor cut in thee in the ſpring tide, and much leſſe eat the eager, beefore thou were ripe. By that I haue ſpoken, I mean, if death had called thee when thy lyfe was ſweeteſt: though thou hadſt not had reaſon to haue complayned, yet thou mightſt haue deſired to haue altered it. For it is a great grief, to ſay vnto a yong man that hee muſt dye, and forſake the world. What is this (my lord) now that the wall is decayed ready to fall, the flower is withered, the grape dooth rotte, the teeth are looſe, the gown is worn, the launce is blunt the knife is dull, and dooſt thou deſire to return into the world, as if thou hadſt neuer knowen the world? Theſe lxii. yeares thou haſt liued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> priſon of thys body, &amp; wilt thou, now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yron fetters haue rot thy legges, deſire yet to length thy days, in this ſo woful priſon? They y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to lyue lx. years &amp; fyue in this death, or to dye in this lyfe: will not deſire to dye in lx. thouſand years. The Emperour <hi>Auguſtus octauian</hi> ſayd. That after men had lyued .l. years, eyther of their own will they ought to dye: or els by force they ſhoold cauſe them ſelues to bee killed. For at that time, all thoſe which haue had any humain felicity, are at the beſt. Thoſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> liue aboue that age, paſſe their days in greeuous torments. As in the death of children, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſſe of goods, &amp; impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne in laws, in mainteining proceſſes, in diſcharging debts, in ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for that is paſt, in bewailing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that is preſent, in diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling iniuries, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring woful news, &amp; in other infinit trauails. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it were much better, to haue their eies ſhut in the graue: then their harts &amp; bodies aliue, to ſuffer ſo much in this miſerable life. Hee whom the gods take from this miſerable life at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of 50. years, is quited from al theſe miſeries of life. For after that time hee is not weak, but crooked, he goeth not, but rouleth, hee ſtumbleth not but falleth. O my lord Mark, knoweſt thou not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by the ſame way whereby goeth death, death cometh? Knowſt not thou in like maner, that it is 52. years that life hath fled from death: and that there is an other time aſmuch, that death goeth ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thy life? and death going from <hi>Illiria</hi> where hee left a great plague, and thou departing from thy pallayce ye .ii. now haue met in <hi>Hungary?</hi> knowſt not thou, that where thou leapedſt out of thy mothers intrails to gouern the land, immediatly death leaped out of his graue to ſeeke thy life? Thou haſt always preſumed, not onely to bee honored: but alſo to bee honorable, if it bee ſo, ſynce thou honoredſt the Imbaſſadours of Princes which did ſend them the more for their profyt, then for thy ſeruice, why dooſt thou not honor thy meſſenger, whom the gods ſend more for thy profyt, then for their ſeruices? Dooſt thow not remember well, when <hi>Vulcane</hi> my ſonne in law poyſoned mee, more for the couetouſnes of my goods, then any deſire hee had of my life? thou lord did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt come to comfort mee in my chamber, and toldſt mee that the gods were cruell to ſlea the yong: and were pytiful to take the old from this world. And thou ſaydſt further theſe woords. Comfort thee <hi>Panutius:</hi> For if thow were born to dye, now thou dieſt to liue.

The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtula is not there where thou haſt cut y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh. The opilation is not there, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re thou haſt layd the oyntments. There were not the right vayns, where thou dydſt let mee blood. Thou haſt not yet touched the wound, which is the cauſe of all my grief. I mean that thou oughtſt to haue entred further with mee, to haue knowen my grief better. The ſighes which the hart fetcheth (I ſay thoſe which come from the hart) let not euery man thynk which heareth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he can immediatly vnderſtand them. For as men can not remedy the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes of the ſpirit: ſo the gods likewiſe woold not that they ſhoold know the ſecrets of the hart. Without fear or ſhame many dare ſay, that they know the thought of others, wherein they ſhew them ſelues to bee more fooles, then wiſe. For ſince there are many things in mee, wherein I my ſelf doubt: how can a ſtraunger haue any certayn knowledge therein? Thow accuſeſt mee <hi>Panutius,</hi> that I feare death greatly, the which I deny: but to feare it as ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I doo confeſſe. For to deny that I feare not death, ſhoold bee to deny that I am not of fleſh. Wee ſee by experience, that the elephants doo feare the Lyon, the Beare the Elephant, the woolf the Beare, the lamb the woolf, the ratte the catte, the catte the dogge, and the dogge the man: fynally the one and the other doo feare for no other thyng, but for feare that one kylleth not the other. Then ſince brute beaſts refuſe death, the which though they dye, feare not to fyght with the furies, nor hope not to reſt with the gods: ſo much the more ought wee to feare death, which dye in doubt, whither the furies wyll
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21411:271"/>
teare vs in pieces with their torments, or the gods will receyue vs into their houſes with ioy. Thinkeſt thou <hi>Panutius,</hi> that I doo not ſee well that my vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne is gathered, and that it is not hyd vnto mee, that my pallace falleth in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay? I know well, that I haue not but the kirnel of the raiſon, and the ſkinne: and that I haue not but one ſygh of all my lyfe, vntill this time. There was great difference beetweene mee and thee: and now there is great difference beetwixt mee and my ſelf. For about the enſigne, thow dooſt place the army. In the ryuers, thow caſteſt thy nettes, within the parks, thou hunteſt the bulles. In the ſhadow thow takeſt cold. By this I mean, that thow talkeſt ſo much of death: beecauſe that thou art ſure of thy life. O myſerable man that I am, for in ſhort ſpace, of all that in this lyfe I haue poſſeſſed: with mee I ſhall cary nothing, but onely my wynding ſheete. Alas now ſhall I enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field, not where of the fierce beaſts I ſhalbee aſſaulted: but of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry woorms deuoured. Alas I ſee my ſelf in that dyſtreſſe, from whence my frayl fleſh cannot eſcape. And yf any hope remayn, it is in thee o death. When I am ſick, I woold not that hee that is whole ſhoold comfort mee. When I am ſorowfull, I woold not that hee which is mery ſhoold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort mee. When I am baniſhed I woold not that he which is in proſperity ſhoold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort mee. When I am at the hour of death, I woold not that hee ſhoold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort mee, which is not in ſome ſuſpicion of lyfe. But I woold that the poore ſhoold comfort mee in my pouerty, the ſorowfull in my ſorows, the banyſhed in my baniſhment, and hee which is in as great daunger of his life, as I am now at the poynt of death. For there is no counſayle ſo healthfull, nor true: as that of the man which is in ſorow, when hee counſayleth an other, whych is likewiſe tormented him ſelf. If thow conſydereſt well this ſentence, thow ſhalt fynd that I haue ſpoken a thyng very profound, wherein notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my tongue is appeaſed. For in my oppinion euill ſhall hee bee comforted, which is weeping with him, that continually laugheth. I ſay this to the end thow know, that I know it: and that thou perceiue that I perceyue it. And beecauſe thou ſhalt not lyue deceyued, as to my frend I wil diſcloſe the ſecret: and thow ſhalt ſee, that ſmall is the ſorow which I haue, in reſpect of the great, which I haue cauſe to haue. For if reaſon had not ſtryued wyth ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, the ſighs had ended my lyfe, and in a pond of teares, they had made my graue. The things which in mee thow haſt ſeene, which are to abhorre meat, to banyſh ſleepe, to loue care, to bee annoyed with company, to take reſt in ſighs, &amp; to take pleaſure in tears: may eaſely declare vnto thee, what torment is in the ſea of my hart, when ſuch tremblings doo appeare in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth of my body. Let vs now come to the purpoſe, and wee ſhall ſee, why my body is without conſolation, and my hart ſo ouercome with ſorows: for my feelyng, greatly exceedeth my complaynyng, beecauſe the body is ſo delycat, that in ſcratchyng it, it complayneth: and the hart is ſo ſtout and valiaunt, that though it bee hurt, yet it dyſſembleth. O <hi>Panutius,</hi> I let thee weete, that the occaſion why I take death ſo greeuouſly, is beecauſe I leaue my ſonne <hi>Commodus</hi> in this life: who lyueth in this age moſt perillous for hym, and no leſſe daungerous for the Empire. By the flowers are the fruits knowen, by the grapes the vines are knowen, and by the face men are knowen: by the colt the horſe is iudged, and by the infant, youth is knowen.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:272"/>This I ſay by the Prince my ſonne, for that hee hath been euill in my life, I doo ymagyn that hee will bee woorſe after my death. Since thou (as well as I) knowſt the euill condicions of my ſonne, why dooſt thou maruell at the thoughts and ſorows of the father? My ſonne <hi>Commodus</hi> in years is yong, and in vnderſtanding yonger. Hee hath an euill inclynation, and yet hee wil not enforce him ſelf againſt the ſame, hee gouerneth him ſelf by hys own ſence, and in matters of wiſedome hee knoweth lytel: of that hee ſhoold bee ignoraunt, hee knoweth too much: and that which is woorſt of all, hee ys of no man eſteemed. Hee knoweth nothing of things paſt, nor occupyeth hym about any thing preſent. Fynally, for that which with myne eyes I haue ſeene, I ſay, and that which with in my hart I haue ſuſpected I iudge: that ſhortly the perſon of my ſonne ſhallbee in hazard, and the memory of hys fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peryſh. O how vnkyndly haue the Gods vſed them ſelues toward vs, to commaund vs to leaue our honor in the hands of our children? for it ſhoold ſuffice, that wee ſhoold leaue them our goods: and that to our frends we ſhoold commyt our honor. But yet I am ſory, for that they conſume the goods in vices: and loſe the honor, for to bee vitious. The gods beeyng pityful as they are, ſince they geeue vs the authoryty to deuyde our goods: why doo they not geeue vs leaue, to make our wills of the honor? My ſonnes name beeing <hi>Commodus,</hi> in the Romayn tongue, is as much to ſay, as profyt: but as hee is, wee will bee content to bee without the lytle profyt, which hee may doo to ſome, ſo that wee may bee excuſed of the great domage, which hee is lykely to doo to all. For I ſuppoſe hee wyll bee the ſcourge of men, and the wrath of Gods. Hee entreth now into the pathway of youth, alone without a guide. And for that hee hath to paſſe, by the hygh and daungerous places: I feare leſt hee bee loſt, in the wood of vices. For the children of Princes, and great Lords, for ſo much as they are brought vp in lyberty, &amp; wantonnes, doo eaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall into vices, and voluptuouſnes: and are moſt ſtubborn to bee wythdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen from their folly. O <hi>Panutius,</hi> geue attentiue eare to that I ſay vnto thee. Seeſt thow not, that <hi>Commodus</hi> my ſonne is at lyberty, is rych, is yong, and is alone? By the fayth of a good man, I ſweare vnto thee, that the leaſt of theſe wynds woold ouerthrow, not onely a yong tender aſh: but alſo a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtrong oke. Ryches, youth, pride, and lyberty, are fower plagues which poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the prince, replenyſh the common wealth with filth, kill, the lyuing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame the dead. Let the old men beeleeue mee, and the yong men mark well what I ſay, that where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods haue geeuen many gyfts: it is neceſſary they haue many vertues to ſuſteyn them. The gentle, the peaceable the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfait, the ſimple, and the fearful, doo not trouble the common wealth: but thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nature hath geeuen moſt gyfts. For as experience teacheth vs, with the fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt weomen the ſtews are furnyſhed, the moſt proper perſonages are vnſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefaſt, the moſt ſtout and valiaunt are murderers, the moſt ſubtill are thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and men of cleareſt vnderſtanding, oft times beecome moſt fooles. I ſay and ſay again. I affirm, and affirm agayn, I ſweare, and ſweare agayn, that if two men which are adorned with naturall gyfts, doo want requiſyt vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: ſuch haue a knife in their hands, wherewith they doo ſtrike and wound them ſelues, a fyer on their ſhoulders wherewith they burn them ſelues, a ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe at their necks to hang them ſelues, a dagger at their breaſt wherewyth
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21411:272"/>
they kyll them ſelues, a thorn in their foote wherewith they prick them ſelues, and ſtones whereat they ſtumble: ſo that ſtumbling they fall, and falling they fynd them ſelues with death whom they hate, and without lyfe which ſo much they loued. Note well <hi>Panutius,</hi> note, that the man which from his infancy hath always the feare of the gods beefore his eyes, and the ſhame of men, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth trouth to all, and lyueth in preiudice to none: and to ſuch a tree, though euil fortune doo cleaue, the flower of his youth doo wither, the leaues of their fauors drye, they gather the fruits of hys trauailes, they cut the bough of hys offices, they bow the higheſt of his braunches downwards, yet in the end, though of the winds hee bee beaten, hee ſhall neuer bee ouercome, O happy are thoſe fathers, to whom the Gods haue geeuen quick children, wyſe, faire, able, lyght, and valiaunt: but all theſe gifts are but means to make them vicious. And in ſuch caſe, if the fathers woold bee gouerned by my counſayl, I woold rather deſire that members ſhoold want in them: then that vyces ſhoold abound. Of the moſt faireſt chyldren which are born in the Empire, my ſonne <hi>Commodus</hi> the Prince is one. But I woold to the immortal gods, that in face hee reſemble y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blackeſt of <hi>Ethiope:</hi> &amp; in maners, the greateſt phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher of <hi>Greece.</hi> For the glory of the father is not, nor ought not to bee, in that his childe is faire of complexion, and handſome of perſon: but that in his lyfe hee bee very vpryght. Wee will not call hym a pytifull father, but a great enemy, who exalteth foorth his childe, for that hee is faire: and dooth not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him, though hee bee vicious. I durſt ſay, that the father which hath a chyld endued with many goodly gyfts, and that hee dooth employ them all to vices: ſuch a chyld ought not to bee born in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, and if perchaunce he were born, hee ought immediatly to bee buried.</p>

                        <hi>O</hi> What great pyty is it, to ſee how the father buyeth his chyld of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods with ſighs, how the mother deliuer them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> payn, how they both nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them with trauailes, how they watch to ſuſteyn them, how they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to remedy them, and afterwards they haue ſo rebelled, and bee ſo vicious that the myſerable fathers oftentimes doo dye not for age, but for the greeues wherewith their children torment the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I doo remember, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modꝰ</hi> my ſonne beeing yong, &amp; I aged (as I am) w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> great payns wee kept him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vices: but I fear, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after my deth hee wil hate vertues. I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber many yong princes, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> of his age haue enherited the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pire of Rome, who haue beene of ſo wicked a life: that they haue deſerued to loſe both honor, and life. I remember <hi>Dennis</hi> the famous tyraunt of <hi>Scicil,</hi> of whom is ſayed, that as great reward hee gaue to thoſe that inuented vices: as our mother Rome dyd to thoſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> conquered realmes. Such woork could not bee but of a Tyrant, to take them for moſt famyliar, which are moſt vicious. I remember fower yong princes, which gouerned the empire, but not with ſuch valyauntnes, as the great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander:</hi> that is to weete, <hi>Alexander, Antiochus, Siluius,</hi> and <hi>Ptholomeus,</hi> to whom for their vanyty and lightnes, as they called <hi>Alexander</hi> the great,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:273"/>
Emperour in Greece: ſo likewiſe doo they call theſe yong men, tiraunts in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</hi> Very happy was <hi>Alexander</hi> in life, &amp; they vnhappy after his death. For all that which with glorious triumphs hee wanne, with vile vices they loſt. So that <hi>Alexander</hi> deuided between them fower the world, and afterwards it came into the hands of mo then fower hundreth. I doo remember, that kyng <hi>Antigonus</hi> litle exteemed that, which coſt his lord <hi>Alexander</hi> much. Hee was ſo lyght in the beehauior of his perſon, and ſo defamed in the affaires of the common wealth: that for mockry and contempt, in the ſteede of a crown of gold, hee bare a garland, in the ſteede of a ſcepter, hee caryed neitels in hys hand, &amp; of this ſort and maner hee ſat to iudge among his counſailours, and vſed to talk with ſtraungers. This yong prince dooth offend mee much, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lightnes hee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted: but much more I marueyl at the grauity of the ſages of Greece, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſuffred him. It is but meete hee bee partaker of the payn, which condeſcended to the fault. I doo remember <hi>Calligulus</hi> the fowerth Emperour of Rome, who was ſo yong and foolyſh, that I doubt of theſe two thyngs, which was greateſt in his time. That is to weete, the dyſobedyence which the people beare to their lord: or the hate which the lord beare to hys people. For that vnhappy creature was ſo dyſordered in his maners, that if all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns had not watched to take life from him: hee woold haue watched to take life from them. This <hi>Caligula</hi> ware a brooche of gold in his cap, where in were writen theſe woords. <hi>Vtinam omnis populus vnam preciſe ceruicem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beret, vt vno ictu omnes necarem.</hi> Whych is to ſay: woold to god all the people had but one neck, to the end I might kyll them all at a ſtroke. I remember the Emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> thadoptiue ſonne of the good <hi>Ceſar Auguſtus,</hi> whych was called <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> beecauſe hee greatly augmented the empire. But the good Emperour did not ſo much augment the ſtate of hys common wealth, duryng hys lyfe: as <hi>Tiberius</hi> dyd dymyniſh it, after hys death. The hate and mallyce which the Romayn people bare to <hi>Tiberius</hi> in hys lyfe, was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfeſtly dyſcouered after the tyme of hys death. For the day that <hi>Tiberius</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (or better to ſay, when they kylled him) the Romayn people made great proceſſyons, and the Senators offred great preſents to the Temples, and the prieſts gaue great ſacrifyces to their Gods: and all to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end their Gods ſhoold not receyue the ſoule of thys tiraunt amongſt them, but that they woold ſend it to bee kept among the furies of hell. I remember <hi>Patrocles</hi> (ſecond kyng of <hi>Corinthe</hi>) inheryted the realme at two &amp; twenty years of his age, who was ſo dyſordered of hys fleſh, ſo vndyſcreete in hys doings, ſo couetous of goods, and ſuch a coward of hys perſon, that where hys father had poſſeſſed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme forty yeares, the ſonne dyd not poſſeſſe it thyrty moneths. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Tarquine</hi> the proud, who though among eyght knyghts of Rome was the laſt, and comlyeſt of geſture, valyaunt in armes, nobleſt of blood, and in geeuyng moſt lyberall: yet hee employed all hys gyfts and graces which the Gods had geeuen hym, euyll. For hee employed hys bewty to ryot, and hys forces to tyranny. For through the treaſon, and vyllany, whych hee commytted with the Romayn <hi>Lucretia,</hi> hee dyd not onely loſe the realme, and flying ſaued hys lyfe: but allſo for euer was banyſhed, and all hys lynage likewiſe. I remember the cruell emperor <hi>Nero,</hi> who lyued, enherited,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21411:273"/>
and dyed yong: and not without a cauſe I ſay, that hee lyued, and dyed yong. For in him was graffed the ſtock of the noble and worthy <hi>Ceſars:</hi> and in him was renewed, the memory of thoſe Tyraunts. To whom thinkeſt thou <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius,</hi> this tiraunt woold haue geeuen lyfe, ſince hee with his own hands ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue his mother her death? Tel mee I pray thee, who thinkeſt thou hath made that curſed hart, who ſlew hys mother, out of whoſe womb hee came? ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her breaſts, which gaue hym ſuck? ſhed the blood, whereof hee was born? tore the armes in w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> hee was caryed? &amp; ſaw the intrails, wherein hee was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med? The day y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the emperour <hi>Nero</hi> ſlew his mother, an orator ſaid in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iure interficienda erat Agrippina que tale portentum peperit in populo romano.</hi> Which is to ſay, iuſtly deſerued <hi>Agrippina</hi> to bee put to death, which brought foorth ſo ſtraunge a monſter amongſt the Romayn people.</p>
                     <p>Thou oughtſt not therefore to marueil <hi>(Panutius)</hi> at the nouelties whych thou haſt ſeene in mee: for in theſe three days that I haue beene troubled in my mynd, and altered in my vnderſtandyng, all theſe things are offred vnto mee, and from the botom of my hart I haue digeſted them. For the carefull men are not blynded, but with their own ymaginacions. All theſe euil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions which theſe Princes had ſcattered amongſt them (of whom I haue ſpoken) doo meete togethers in my ſonne <hi>Commodus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For if they were yong, hee is yong. If they were rych, hee is rych. If they were free, hee is free. If they were bold, hee is bold. If they were wilde, hee is wilde. If they were euill, certaynly I doo not think that hee is good. For wee ſee many yong princes, which haue been well brought vp, and well taught: yet when they haue inherited, and come to their lands, they beecome immediatly vitious, and diſſolute. What hope haue wee of thoſe, which from their infancy are diſſolute and euill enclined? of good wyne, I haue made oft times ſtrong vineger: but of pure vineger, I haue neuer ſeene good wine. This childe keepeth mee, beetwene the ſayles of feare, &amp; the anker of hope: hopyng hee ſhal bee good, ſince I haue taught him wel, &amp; fearing hee ſhallbee euill, beecauſe his mother <hi>Fauſtine</hi> hath noriſhed him euil. And that which ys the woorſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the yong childe of his own nature is inclined to al euil. I am mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſay this much, for that I ſee his naturall inclinacion increaſe: and that which was taught him dimyniſh, for the which occaſyon, I doubt that after my death, my ſonne ſhal return to that, wherin his mother hath noriſhed him: &amp; not to that, wherein I haue taught him. O how happy had I been, if neuer I had had childe, for not to be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to leaue him thempire: for I woold choſe then, among the children of the good fathers: &amp; woold not bee bound to ſuch a one, whom the gods haue geeuen mee. One thing I aſk thee <hi>Panutius,</hi> whom wooldſt thou cal moſt fortunat? <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> was naturall father of <hi>Domitius,</hi> or <hi>Nerua,</hi> the adopted father of the good <hi>Traiane?</hi> both thoſe two (<hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Nerua</hi>) were good princes, but of children. <hi>Domitian</hi> was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> head of al miſchief: &amp; <hi>Traiane</hi> was the mirrour of al goodnes. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> in that hee had chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, was vnhappy: &amp; <hi>Nerua</hi> in that hee had none, was moſt fortunat. One thing I wil tel thee <hi>Panutius,</hi> the which by thee conſidered, thou wylt litle eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme life, and ſhalt loſe the feare of death. I haue lyued lxii. years, wherein I haue read much, hard much, ſene, deſired, attained, poſſeſſed, ſuffred &amp; I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue much reioyſed my ſelf. And in the end of al this, I ſee my ſelf now to dye,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:274"/>
and I muſt want my pleaſures, and my ſelf allſo. Of all that I haue had, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, attained, &amp; whereof I haue enioyed, I haue only two things: to weete, payn for that I haue offended the gods, and ſorow for the time which I haue waſted in vices. There is great difference beetweene the rych and the poore in death, and more in lyfe. For the poore dyeth to reſt, but yf the rich dye it is to their great payn. So that the gods take from the one, that which hee had: &amp; putteth the other in poſſeſſion, of that hee deſired. Great care hath the hart to ſeeke the goods, and they paſſe great troubles to heap vp them togethers, and great diligence muſt bee had in keeping them, and alſo much wyt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe them: but without compariſon, it is greater grief to depart from them. O what payn intollerable and grief it is to the wiſe man, ſeeing hym ſelf at the poynt of death, to leaue the ſwet of his famyly, the maieſty of his empire, the honor of his preſent, the loue of his frends, the payment of his debts, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of his ſeruaunts, and the memory of hys predeceſſours, in the power of ſo euill a chyld, the which neither deſerueth it, nor yet wil deſerue it. In their table of our auncyent laws, were writen theſe woords. Wee ordeyn and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, that the father which ſhall bee good according to the oppinion of all, may diſheryt his ſonne, who according to the opinion of all is euill. The law ſayd further. The chyld which hath dyſobeyed hys father, robbed any holy Temple, iniuryed any wyddow, fled from any battaile, and committed any treaſon to a ſtraunger, that hee ſhoold bee baniſhed from Rome, and dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited from his fathers goods. Truely the law was good, though by our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences it bee forgotten. If my breath fayled mee not as it dooth fayle mee (for of trouth I am greatly payned) I woold declare vnto thee how many <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, Medians, Egiptians, Aſſirians, Caldeans, Indians, Hebrues, Greekes,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> haue left their children poore beeing able to haue left them rych, for no other cauſe, but for that they were vicious. And to the contrary, other beeyng poore, haue left them rych, for that they were vertuous. By the immortall Gods I ſweare vnto thee, that when they came from the warre of <hi>Parthia,</hi> &amp; triumphed in Rome, &amp; confirmed the Empire to my ſonne, if then theſe nat nat had not withſtoode mee, I had left <hi>Commodus</hi> my ſonne poore wyth hys vices: and woold haue made heire of all my realmes, ſome vertuous man. I let thee to weete <hi>Panutius,</hi> that fyue thyngs oppreſſe my hart ſore, to the which I woold rather ſee remedy my ſelf, then to commaund other to remedy it.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, for that in my lyfe time I can not determyn the proces, that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous wydow, <hi>Druſia</hi> hath with the ſenat. Beecauſe ſince ſhee is poore, and deformed, there is no man that will geeue her iuſtice. The ſecond, beecauſe I dye not in Rome. And this for none other cauſe, then that with the ſound of the trumpet ſhoold bee proclaymed, that all thoſe which haue any quarell, or debt againſt mee, and my famyly, ſhould come thither to bee payd, or ſatiſfyed of their debts, and demaunds. The thyrd, that as I made fower tyraunts to bee put to execucion, which commytted tyranny in Aſia and Italy: ſo it gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued mee that I haue not alſo puniſhed certayn Pyrats, which roued on the ſeas. The fowerth, for that I haue not cauſed the Temple to bee fyniſhed which I dyd beegynne for all the gods. For I might haue ſayd vnto them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my death, that ſince for all them I haue made one houſe: it were not much that any of them ſhoold receiue one into his, which paſſe thys lyfe in the fauor
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21411:274"/>
of gods, and wythout the hatred of men. For dying after this ſort, men ſhal ſuſteyn our honours: and the gods ſhall prouide for our ſoules.</p>
                     <p>The fyfth, for that I leaue in life for my onely heire, <hi>Commodus</hi> the prynce, yet not ſo much for the deſtruction which ſhall come to my houſe: as for the great domage which ſhall ſucceede in the common wealth. For the true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to take the domages of their perſons lyght, and the domages of the common wealth for the moſt greeuous. O <hi>Panutius,</hi> let therefore thys bee the laſt woord which I will ſay vnto thee, that is to weete, that the greateſt good that the Gods may geeue to the man that is not couetous, but vertuous, is to geeue hym good renowne in lyfe: and afterwards a good heire at our death. Fynally I ſay, that if I haue anything to doo with the gods, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and beeſeech them, that if they ſhould bee offended, Rome ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, my renowme defamed, and my houſe demyniſhed, for that my ſonne bee of an euill lyfe: that they wyll take from hym lyfe, beefore they geeue mee death.</p>

                     <head>¶Of the woords which the Emperour Marcus Aurelius ſpake vnto his ſonne Commodus at the hower of death, neceſſary for all yong gentlemen to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Cap. liiij.</head>
                     <p>SInce the dyſeaſe of <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was ſo extream, that in euery hower of his lyfe hee was aſſaulted with death: after hee had talked a long tyme with <hi>Panutius</hi> his ſecretary, hee commaunded his ſonne <hi>Commodus</hi> to be wakened, who as a yong man ſlept ſoundly in his bed. And beeing come bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his preſence, al thoſe which were there, were moued immediatly with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, to ſee the eies of the father all ſwollen with weeping: and the eies of the chylde, cloſed with ouermuch ſleepe. They could not waken the chylde, hee was ſo careles: and they could not cauſe the goodfather ſleape, hee tooke ſo great thought. All thoſe which were there, ſeeing how the father deſired the good lyfe of the ſonne, and how lytel the ſonne wayed the death of his father: had compaſſion of the old man, and bare hate to the wicked chylde. Then the good Emperour caſting his eies on high, and directing his woords to his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne ſayd. When thou were a chylde, I told thy maiſters how they ought to bring thee vp: &amp; after that thou dydſt waxe greater, I told thy gouernors how they ſhoold counſaile thee: And now will I tel thee, how thou with them which are few, and they with thee, beeing one, ought to gouern and maintayn the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. If thou eſteeme much that which I wil ſay vnto thee my ſonne: know thow, that I will eſteeme it much more that thow wilt beeleue mee. For more eaſely doo wee old men, ſuffer your iniuryes: then yee other yong, doo receyue our counſailes. Wyſedome wanteth to you for to beeleeue vs, yet yee want not boldneſſe to diſhonor vs. And that which is woorſt, the aged (in Rome) were wont to haue a chayr of wyſedome, and ſagenes: but now a days the yong men count it a ſhame and folly. The world at this day ys ſo chaunged, from that it was wont to bee in tymes paſt: that all haue the auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to geeue counſaile, and few haue the wiſedome to receyue it, ſo that they are a thowſaund, which ſell counſailes: &amp; there is not one, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> buyeth wiſedom. I beleeue wel my ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> according to my fatal deſtinies, &amp; thy euill manners,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:275"/>
litle ſhal y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> auaile which I ſhal tel thee. For ſince thou wooldſt not credyt theſe woords, which I ſpake vnto thee in my life: I am ſure that thou wilt litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them after my death. But I doo this more to ſatiſfy my deſyre, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh that which I owe vnto the common wealth: than for that I hope for any amendment of thy lyfe. For there is no grief that ſo much hurteth a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as when hee him ſelf is cauſe of his own payn. If any man dooth me an iniury, if I lay my hands vppon him, or ſpeak iniurious woords vnto him, my hart is foorthwith ſatiſfyed: but if I doo iniury to my ſelf, I am hee w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, &amp; am wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged, for that I haue none on whom I may reuenge my wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, and I vexe &amp; chafe with my ſelf. If thou my ſonne bee euill, after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou haſt enheryted the empire: my mother Rome wil complain of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods, which haue geeuen thee ſo many euil inclinacions. Shee wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playn of <hi>Fauſtine</hi> thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hath brought thee vp ſo wantonly, ſhee will complayn of thee w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> haſt no will to reſiſt vice: but ſhee ſhall haue no cauſe to complayn of the old man thy father, who hath not geeuen thee good counſailes. For if thou hadſt beeleeued that, which I told thee: men woold reioyce to haue thee for their lord, and the gods to vſe thee as their miniſter. I cannot tel my ſonne if I bee deceiued, but I ſee thee ſo depriued of vnderſtanding, ſo vncertayn in thy woords, ſo diſſolute in thy maners, ſo vniuſt in iuſtice, in that thou deſireſt ſo hardy, &amp; in thy duty ſo negligent: that if thou chaunge &amp; alter not thy maners, men wil hate thee, and the gods will forſake thee. O if thou knewſt my ſonne what thyng it is to haue men for enemies, and to bee forſaken of the gods, by the faith of a good man I ſweare vnto thee, that thou wooldſt not onely hate the ſeignory of Rome, but with thy hands alſo thou wooldſt deſtroy thy ſelfe. For men which haue not the gods mercifull, and the men frendly, doo eat the bread of grief, and drink y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tears of ſorow. I am ſure thy ſorow is not ſo great to ſee that the nyght dooth end my life: as is the pleaſure which thou haſt, to ſee that in ſhort ſpace thou ſhalt bee emperor of Rome. And I doo not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell hereat. For where ſenſuality reigneth, reaſon is baniſhed &amp; conſtrayned to fly. Many loue diuers things, beecauſe of trouth they know them not: the which if they did know, without doubt they woold hate them. Though men loue in mockry, the gods &amp; men hate vs in earneſt. In al things wee are ſo doubtfull, and in all our woorks ſo dyſordered, that at ſome tyme our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is dull, and loſeth the edge: &amp; an other tyme, it is more ſharp then it is neceſſary. Thereby I mean, that the good wee wil not here, and much leſſe wee will learn it, but of the euil wee know, more then beehoueth vs, or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity requireth. I will counſaile thee my ſonne by woords, that which in lxii. yeares I haue learned by ſcyence and experience. And ſince thou art as yet ſo yong, it is reaſon that thou beleeue him which is aged. For ſince wee prynces are the mirrour of all, euery man dooth beehold vs, &amp; wee other doo not bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ourſelues. This day, or to morow, thou ſhalt enherit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romain empire, &amp; think that inheriting the ſame, thou ſhalt bee lord of the world. Yet if thow knewſt how many cares and perilles, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding bringeth with it, I ſweare vnto thee, that thou wooldſt rather choſe to obey all, then to commaund one. Thou thinkeſt my ſonne, that I leaue thee a great lord, for to leaue thee the empire, which is not ſo. For all they haue neede but of thee, and thou alone haſt neede of all. Thou thinkeſt that I leaue thee much treaſure, leauing thee
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:21411:275"/>
the great reuenews of the empire, the which alſo is as litle. For though a prince haue treaſures in aboundance, yet if hee want frends, hee hath great want of treſures. Thou thinkeſt alſo my ſonne, that I leaue thee that thou bee obeyed of all, and that none dare gayn ſay thee.</p>
                     <p>Truly it ought not to bee ſo. For it is more meete for the prince (which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to preſerue his lyfe, and augment his honor) to bee conformable to the will of all: then to deſire that all ſhoold bee agreable to him. For thou my ſonne, that knoweſt not what truth is, lies wil not greeue thee. For aſmuch as thou knoweſt not what reſt is, the broyls and mocions of the people ſhall not vex thee. For that thou knoweſt not what frends meane, thou ſhalt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme it litle to haue enemies. For if thou were pacient, repoſed, true, &amp; a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing man: thou wouldſt not only refuſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> empire of Rome, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wooldſt curſe the father which woold leaue thee ſuch inheritance. I will thou know if thou knoweſt it not, that in leauing thee the empire, I leaue thee not riches, but pouerty: not reſt, but trauayle: not peace, but warr: not frends, but ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: not pleaſures but diſpleaſures: finally in place I leaue thee, where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes thou ſhalt haue ſomwhat to beewayle. And though thou wouldſt, thou ſhalt not laugh. I aduertiſe, admoniſh, and alſo exhort thee my ſonne, to think that all that which I leaue thee, is vanity, lightnes, and folly, and a diſgiſed mockry. And if thou beeleueſt it is in mockry, from henſforth I know thou art deceyued. I haue liued longer then thou, I haue read more than thou, and with great payne haue gone further than thou. And ſins that with all theſe aduertiſements, in the end I find my ſelfe mocked: hopeſt thou to liue ſurely, and eſcape without fraud or guyle? When thou ſhalt think to haue the empire in reſt, then ſhall there ariſe a prouince in <hi>Affrica,</hi> or in <hi>Aſia,</hi> the loſſe of the which ſhould come to a great inconuenience: and for to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it, great charges would enſue. When thou thinkeſt to recouer frends, then ſhall ſtraunge enemyes inuade thee. So that in flattering, and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our frends, wee can not keepe theym: and in flying, and reiecting theym, wee can not defend our ſelues. When thou ſhalt think to bee in gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ioy, then ſhall ſome care oppreſſe thy hart. For princes which haue, and poſſeſſe much the news which geeue them pleaſure, are very ſeldome: but the thinges which annoy them, come hourely. When thou ſhalt think to haue liberty, to doo what thou wilt: then ſhalt thou bee moſt reſtrayned.</p>
                     <p>For the good and well ordered princes, ought not to go whither their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton deſires moueth theym: but where it is moſt lawful, and decent for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their eſtates. When thou ſhalt think that none dare reproue thee, for that thou art emperour, then oughtſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt to beeware. For if they dare not threaten euell princes with woords, they haue the hardines to ſell them by treaſon. If they dare not puniſh them, they dare murmour at them: and theſe which can not bee their frendes, doo procure to bee their enemies: fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if they lay not hands on their perſons, thei let their tong runne at large to prate of their renoune. When thou ſhalt thynk to haue ſatiſfyed thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, then wyll they demaund recompence for their ſeruices. For it is an old cuſtome among courtyers, to ſpend freely, and couet greedily. Therefore if thou dooſt credit theſe things, I know not who is ſo fooliſh, that for his enherytaunce deſyreth ſuch ſorow. For admit that any man come to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:276"/>
without compariſon the reſt is more woorth, which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> empire taketh from him: then the pleaſures which it geeueth him? If the empire of Rome were as well corrected and ordred, as in old time it was accuſtomed to bee: though it were great payne to gouerne it, yet it were more honor to keepe it, but it is ſo rooted in vices, and ſo many tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are entred therin, that I woold tak the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more wiſe to iudge it a mockry, then thoſe which embraſe it as an honor. If thou knewſt what Rome is woorth, what Rome hath, what Rome may, and what Rome is, I ſweare vnto thee, that thou wouldſt not labor much to be lord therof. For though Rome w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> walles bee ſtrongly compaſſed: yet of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Citezins it is greatly vnprouided. If the inhabitants bee great, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are without nomber. Finally I ſay, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtones which are in the buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, in one day may bee counted: but the euils which are therin, in a .1000. yeres can not bee declared. By the faith of a good man I ſweare vnto thee, my ſonne, that when I beegan to reygne, in 3. yeres I repaired the decayed walles that were of Rome fallen: and one onely ſtreete to liue wel, in xx. yers I could not refourme. The deuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid very well: That much more ought the great cityes to glorify, to haue vertuous citezins: then to haue proud &amp; ſumptuous buildings. Beeware, beeware my ſonne, that the inconſtancy of youth, and the liberty which y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt to poſſeſſe, and gouerne the empire, cauſe thee not to vndoo thy ſelfe. For hee is not counted free, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in liberty is borne: but hee that dyeth in liberty. O of how many I haue red, hard, &amp; alſo ſeene which are borne ſlaues, and afterwards haue dyed free: and this for that they were vertuous. And how many I haue ſeene die ſlaues, beeing bornfree on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for beeing vicious: ſo that there liberty remayneth, where noblenes is reſident. Princes which haue great realmes, of neceſſity ſhall haue occaſions to puniſh many exceſſes: wherfore it is requiſite, that they bee couragious. And beeleue mee my ſonne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ought not to take corrage vpon them, bee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe they bee mighty, and puiſſaunt: but beecauſe they are vertuous. For to puniſh theſe exceſſes of others, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good life is more requiſite: then is the great auctority of the empire. A vertuous prince ought to leaue no vice vnpuniſhed, for the good, to folow good, &amp; the euil for feare of his correction, dare not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any offence in the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth. Hee that lyueth like a wiſe man, is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to geeue puniſhment: but hee that liueth in feare, dare not almoſt ſpeak. For the man which dare bee ſo hardy to puniſh an other, for the ſelf ſame fault for the which hee deſerueth to bee puniſhed: of the gods hee is iuſtly hated, &amp; of men deſpiſed. Let princes take it for an aſſured thing, that they ſhal neuer haue the loue of the people, the liberty of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wealth, the order of their houſe, the contentation of their frends, the ſubiection of their enemies, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience of their people: but with many tears ſhed on the earth, and with many proweſſes doone of his perſon. To a vertuous prince, all doo render: &amp; againſt the vicious prince, all the earth doth rebell. If thou wilt bee vertuous heare what thing vertu is. Vertu is a caſtle which neuer is taken, a riuer w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is not paſſed ouer, a ſea which is not ſailed, a fire that neuer is quenched, a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that neuer is waſted, an army y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neuer is ouerthrowen, a chaunge which neuer wearieth, a ſpy w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> alwaies returneth, a ſigne which beegileſh no man, a way very ſtreight, a frend that ſuccoureth al neceſſities, a ſurgion that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly healeth, &amp; a renowne which neuer periſheth. If thou kneweſt, my
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21411:276"/>
ſonne, what thing it is to bee good, thou wouldſt bee the beſt of the world. For the more vicious a man is, ſo much the more hee is entangled in vices: &amp; how much more a man is vertuous, ſo much more to vertues hee cleaueth. If thou wilt bee vertuous, thou ſhalt doo ſeruice to the gods, thou ſhalt geeue good re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nowne to thy predeceſſors, &amp; for thy ſelfe thou ſhalt prepare a perpetual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Thou ſhalt doo pleaſures to ſtraungers, &amp; get y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fauor of thine owne people. Finally, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good will honor thee with loue: &amp; the euil wil ſerue thee w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> feare. In the hiſtories of the warres of the Charentines, I found y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Pirrus</hi> (king of <hi>Epirotes</hi>) did weare in a ring theſe woords writen. It is too litle puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for a vicious man, to take his life from him: &amp; it is too ſmal a reward for a vertuous man, to geeue him the ſeignory of the whole earth. Truly theſe woords were woorthy of ſuch a man. What thing can bee bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon of a vertuous man, wherof wee hope not to ſee the end, &amp; come to good proofe? I am deceyued, if I haue not ſeene in my days many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which were baſe borne, vnfitt for ſciences, void of vices in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, poore of goods &amp; vnknowen of birth, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> with all theſe baſe condicions haue learned ſo many vertues, that it ſeemed great raſhnes to beegin them: &amp; afterwards for bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vertuous only, they haue found the effects ſuch as they thought it. By the immortal gods I ſweare vnto thee, &amp; ſo the god <hi>Iupiter</hi> take mee into his holy houſe &amp; confirme thee my ſonne in mine: if I haue not knowen a gardner &amp; a potter in Rome, which for beeing vertuous, were occaſion to caſt fiue rich ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours out of the ſenate. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe to make the one to gayne, &amp; the other to looſe, was that to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one they would not pay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pots, and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other his appels For at that time more was hee puniſhed, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> tooke an apple from a poore man, then hee w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> bet down a rich mans houſe. All this I haue told thee my ſonne, beecauſe vice abaſeth the hardy prince: &amp; vertue geeueth courage to the baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. From .ii. things I haue always kept my ſelfe. That is to weete, not to ſtriue againſt open iuſtice, nor to contend with a vertuous perſon.</p>

                     <p>HItherto I haue ſpoken to thee in generally, but now I will ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the particulerly, &amp; by the immortal gods I coniure thee, that thou bee very attentiue to that I will ſay: For talking to thee as an aged father it is reaſon thou heare mee as an obedient chyld.

to leaue thee many good counſayls, wherwith thou maiſt preſerue thy ſelue, ſuſteyne thy parſon, &amp; mayntayne thine honour.

For ſometimes they accompany with ſo diſhoneſt perſons, and ſo vnthrifty: that: they ſpend their goods, they looſe their honor, &amp; weary their perſons more, than if they were occupied in the affaires of the common wealth. For thy youth, I leaue thee children of great lords, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whom thou maiſt paſt the tyme away. And not without cauſe I haue prouided that with thee they haue beene brought vp from thy infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. For after thou cameſt to mannes eſtate, enheriting my goods, if perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce thou wooldſt accompany thy ſelfe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yong men, thou ſhouldſt find them well learned. For thy warres, I leaue thee valiaunt captaines, though (indeede) things of war are beegoon by wiſdome: yet in the end, the iſſue faleth out by fortune. For ſtuards of thy treaſures, I leaue thee faithful men. And not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out cauſe, I ſay they are faythfull. For oftentimes greater are the theeues w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> are receyuers, &amp; treſorers, then are they that doo robbe among the people. I leaue thee (my ſonne) expert &amp; auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men, of whome thou maiſt take cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municat thy trobles. For there can bee fourmed no honeſt thing in a prince, vnleſſe hee hath in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men: for ſuch geeue grauity to his parſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; auctority to his pallace. To inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t theaters, to fiſh ponds: to chaſe wild beaſts in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forreſts, to renne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyelds, to let thy haukes fly, &amp; to exerciſe weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, al theſe things wee can deny thee, as to a yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beeing yong, mayſt reioyce thy ſelf in al theſe. Thou oughtſt alſo to haue reſpect, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to ordeine armies, inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t warrs, folow victories, accept truces, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm peace raiſe brutes, to make laws, to promote y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one, &amp; put downe the others,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21411:277"/>
to puniſh the euill, &amp; firſt to reward the good, the counſaile of al theſe things ought to bee taken, of cleare iudgements, of perſons of experience, &amp; of white heads. Thinkeſt thou not, that it is poſſible to paſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time with the yong, &amp; to counſail with the old? The wiſe and diſcreete princes, for all things haue time inough, if they know well how to meaſure it. Bee ware my ſonne, that they note thee not to vſe great extremities. For the end &amp; occaſion why I ſpeake it, is beecauſe thou ſhouldſt know (if thou knoweſt not) that it is as vndecent a thing for a prince, vnder the colour of grauity, to bee ruled &amp; gouerned who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by old men: as vnder ſemblaunce of paſtime, alwayes to accompany hym ſelfe with the yong. It is no general rule, that all yong men are light, nor all old men ſage. And thou muſt according to my aduiſe, in ſuch caſe vſe it thus: if ani old man loſe the grauity of his age, expulſe him from the: if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> find any yong men ſage, diſpiſe not their counſaile. For the bees doo draw more hony out of the tender flowers: then of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hard leaues. I doo not condemne the aged, nor I doo commend the yong, but it ſhal bee wel doone, that alwayes thou chooſe of both the moſt vertuous. For of troth, there is no company in the world ſo euil ordered, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is meane to liue with it, without any ſuſpicion: ſo that if the yong are euil with folly, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old are worſe through couetouſnes. Ons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine I retourne to aduertiſe thee (my ſonne) that in no wiſe thou vſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. For if thou beeleeue none but yong, they will corrupt thy maners with lightnes: &amp; if y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> beeleeue none but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old, they will depraue thy iuſtice through couetouſnes. What thing can bee more monſtruous, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince which commaundeth all, ſhould ſuffer him to bee commaunded of one alone? Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue mee ſonne in this caſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the gouernments of many, are ſeldome times gouerned wel by the head of one alone. The prince which hath to rule &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne many, ought to take the aduiſe and counſaile of many. It is a great in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>conuenience, that thou beeing lord of many realmes, ſhouldſt haue but one gate, wherin all doo enter into, to doo their buſines w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thee. For if perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce hee which ſhall bee thy familiar, bee of his owne nature good, and bee not mine enemy: yet I would bee afraid of him, beecauſe hee is a freend of mine enemies. And though for hate they doo mee no euil: yet I am afraid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of an other, hee will ceaſe to doo mee good. I remember that in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalles of <hi>Pompeius,</hi> I found a litle booke of memoryes, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> the great <hi>Pompeiꝰ</hi> bare about him, wherin were many things that hee had read, &amp; other good counſayles, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> in diuers parts of the world hee had learned: and among other words, there were theſe. The gouernour of the common wealth, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth al the gouernment to old men, deſerueth very litle: &amp; hee that truſteth al yong, is light. Hee that gouerneth it by him ſelfe alone, is beeyonde him ſelf: &amp; hee w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> by him ſelf &amp; others doo gouerne it, is a wiſe prince. I know not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe ſentences are of the ſame <hi>Pompeius,</hi> or that hee gathered them out of ſoome booke, or that any philoſopher had told him them, or ſome freend of his had geeuen him them. I meane, that I had them writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his hands and truely they deſerued to bee written in letters of gold. When thy affaires ſhal bee weighty, ſee thou diſpatche theym alwayes by counſayle. For when the affaires bee determined by the counſaile of many, the fault ſhal bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided among them all. Thou ſhalt find it for a truth (my ſonne) that if thou take counſaile of many, the one wil tel the inconuenience, the other the peril,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:278"/>
other the feare the other the domage, the other the profit, &amp; the other the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, finally, they will ſo debate thy affaires, that playnly thou ſhalt know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good &amp; ſee the daunger therof. I aduertiſe thee (my ſonne) that when thou takſt counſayle, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> beehold w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy eyes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inconuenience, as wel as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remedyes w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they ſhal offer vnto thee. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile conſiſteth not, to tel what they ought to doo, but to declare what therof is like to ſucceede. When y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhalt enter priſe (my ſonne) great &amp; weighty affayres, aſmuch oughtſt y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> to regard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> litle damages for to cut the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of in time: as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great miſhaps, to remedy them. For of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes it chaunceth, that for the neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of taking vp a gutter, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole houſe falleth to the ground. Notwithſtanding I tell thee thou take counſayl. I meane not, that thou oughtſt to bee ſo curious, as for euery trifle to cal thy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle. For there are many things of ſuch quality, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would bee immedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>atly put in execution: &amp; they doo endomage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, attending for cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſayle. That which by thine owne aucthority thou maiſt diſpatch with out the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the common wealth, referre it to no other perſon: &amp; here in thou ſhalt bee iuſt, &amp; ſhalt doo iuſtice confourmable. For conſidering that thy ſeruice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth onely of them, the reward which they ought to haue, ought to depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d onely on thee. I remember, that when <hi>Marius</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſul came from the warres of <hi>Numidia,</hi> hee deuided all the treaſour hee brought amongſt his ſouldyers, not putting one iewell into the common treaſour. And when heere of hee was accuſed, for that hee had not demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded licence of the ſenat: hee aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them. It is not iuſt I take counſayle with others, for to geeue recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to thoſe: which haue not taken y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinions of others, to ſerue mee. Thou ſhalt fynde (my ſonne) a kinde of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are very hard of money, and exceeding prodigall of counſaile. There are alſo dyuers lenders, which without demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding them, doo offer to giue it. With ſuch lyke men, thou ſhalt haue this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, neuer looke thou for good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſaile at that man, whoſe counſaile tendeth to the preiudice of another. For hee offreth woords to thy ſeruice, &amp; trauaileth thy buſines to his owne profyt. As y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods gaue mee long life, of theſe things haue I had great experience, wherin I let thee know, that for the ſpace of .xv yeares I was conſull, Senator, Cenſor, Pretor, Queſtor, Edil, &amp; Tribune: &amp; after al this, I haue been .18. yeares emperor of Rome, wherin al thoſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> haue ſpoken moſt againſt mee, touched the profit or damage of another. The chief intencion of thoſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> folow the courts of Princes are to procure to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their houſes. And if they cannot com to that, they ſeeke to dimyniſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> of another, not for that any profit ſhould folow vnto them therof, bee it neuer ſo litle: but beecauſe mans malyce is of ſuch condicion, that it eſteemeth the profit of another, his own domage. They ought to haue great compaſſion of the Prince, for the moſt that follow him, ſerue him not for that they loue him but for the gyfts &amp; rewards w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they hope to haue of hym. And this ſeemeth to bee true, for the day that Princes ſhal ceaſe to geeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the ſelf ſame day beegyn they to hate hym. So that ſuch ſeruaunts, wee cannot call frends of our perſons: but couetous of our goods. That thou loue (my ſonne) the one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, thou mayſt ryght well: but I aduertyſe thee that thou, nor they doo make any ſemblaunce, in ſuch ſort that al doo know it. For if thou dooſt o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therwyſe: they wil murmure at thee, &amp; wyll all perſecute thee. Hee incurreth into no ſmal peryll, nor hath no lytle trouble, which is aboue al of the Prince beeloued. &amp; of the people hated. For then hee is hated, &amp; perſecuted of all. And
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21411:278"/>
yet more domage enſueth vnto him, of the enmyty of al: then dooth of the loue of the prince alone, For ſometimes (the gods permitting it, and his beehaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our deſeruing it) the Prince dooth ceaſe to loue him: &amp; therewith his enemyes beegyn to perſecute hym. From the tyme I knew what meaned to gouerne a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, I haue always determined, neuer to keepe man in my houſe one day, after I know him to bee an enemy to the common wealth. In the yeare of the foundacion of Rome, 649. <hi>Lucius Lucullus</hi> the Senator going to the warres agaynſt <hi>Mithridate,</hi> by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce found a tablet of copper, in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty called <hi>Triganie,</hi> the which was at the gate of the kyng of that prouynce. And on that ſame was engrauen certayne <hi>Caldean</hi> letters, the which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſayed theſe wordes. The prince is not ſage, who wyll put in hazard the ſtate of his common wealth, for the onely commoditye of one alone: For the ſeruyce of one, cannot auayle againſt the loue of al. The prince is not ſage, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> for to enrich one alone, ſeeketh to empoueriſh all: For it is a thing vntollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the one doo labour the fyelds, and the other doo gather the fruit.</p>
                     <p>The Prince is not iuſt, which wil ſatiſfy the couetouſnes of one more then the ſeruice of all: for there is meane to pay the ſeruices of the good, and there is no ryches to ſatiſfy the couetouſnes of the euyl. The Prince is a foole that deſpyſeth the counſaile of all, and truſteth in the opinyon of one. For though there bee in a great ſhippe but one Pilot, yet it needeth manye Marryners. Bold is the Prince, which to loue one onely, wylbee hated of al: for noble Princes ought to think it much profyt to bee beeloued, and much more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to bee hated. Theſe were the woords which were wrytten in that tablet, worthy of eternal memory. And I wil tel thee further in this caſe that <hi>Lucullus</hi> the Senator ſent on the one part the tablet of copper, where theſe woords were: and on the other part, the coffers where in hee had brought the ryches, to the end the ſenat ſhould chooſe one, and leaue the other. The ſenate deſpyſing the riches and treaſours, chooſe the tablet of counſayles.</p>

I commend vnto thee (my ſonne) the veneracion of the gods, and this cheefely aboue al thing. For the prince w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maketh accompt of the gods, neede not to feare any ſtorme of fortune. Loue the gods, &amp; thou ſhalt bee beeloued. Serue them, &amp; thou ſhalt bee ſerued. Feare them, &amp; thou ſhalt bee feared. Honor them, &amp; thou ſhalt bee honored. Doo their commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dements &amp; they will geeue thee thy harts deſire. For the gods are ſo good, that they doo not onely receiue in accompt, that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> wee doo: but alſo that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> wee deſire to doo. I commend vnto thee (my ſonne) the reuerence of the Temples, that is to weete, that they bee not in diſcorde, that they bee cleane &amp; renewed, that they offer therin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrifices accuſtomed. For wee doo not this honor, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wherwith the temples are made: but to the Gods, to whome they are conſecrated.

The vnhappi realme of <hi>Catthage</hi> was nothing more cowardly, nor leſſe rych, then that of the Romaynes, but in the ende, of the Romaynes, thei were ouercome, beecauſe they were great louers of their treaſours, and litle worſhippers of their Temples. I commend vnto thee (my ſonne) <hi>Helia</hi> thy ſtepe mother: &amp; remember, though ſhee bee not thy mother, yet ſhee hath been my wyfe. That w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> to thy mother <hi>Fauſtine</hi> thou oughtſt for bringing thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world: the ſelfe ſame thou oughtſt to <hi>Helia,</hi> for the good entertainme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which ſhee hath ſhewed thee.

Vſe thy ſiſters in ſuch ſort that they bee not out of fauor, for that their aged father is dead and that they beecome not proud, for to ſee their brother Emperor. Women are of a very tender condicion: for of ſmall occaſion they doo complayne, &amp; of leſſe they wax proud. Thou ſhalt keepe them &amp; preſerue them after my death, as I did in my lyfe. For otherwiſe, their conuerſacion to the people ſhalbee very noiſome: &amp; to thee very importunate.

Euery yeare I gaue to thy ſiſter, ſixe thouſand Sex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terces for her neceſſyties: &amp; in deede I had maryed her alſo, if ſhee had not fal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>len into the fire, &amp; burnt her face.

All haue eſteemed her fal into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire for euyll luck: but I doo cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the euil luck for good fortune. For her face was not ſo burned with coles as her renowme ſuffred peryl among euill tongs. I ſweare vnto thee (my ſonne) that for the ſeruice of the gods, &amp; for the renowme of men: ſhee is more ſure in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Temple w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the veſtal Virgins, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> art in the Senate w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours. I ſuppoſe now, that at the end of the iourney, ſhee ſhal find her ſelfe better to bee encloſed, then thou at liberty. I leaue vnto her (in the prouynce of <hi>Lucania</hi>) euery yeare ſix thouſand ſexterces. Trauaile to augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them for her, &amp; not to dymyniſh them.

                     <head>¶The good Marcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome, endeth his purpoſe &amp; life. And of the laſt woords which hee ſpake to his ſonne Commodus, and of the table of counſels which hee gaue him. Cap. lvii.</head>
                     <p>WHen the Emperor had ended his particuler recommendacions, vnto his ſonne <hi>Commodus,</hi> as the dawning of the day beegan to appeere: ſo his eies beegan to cloſe, his tong to faulter, &amp; his hands to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as it dooth accuſtome to thoſe, which are at the point of death. The prince perceiuing then litle life to remaine, commaunded his ſecretory <hi>Panutius</hi> to go to the coffer of his books, &amp; to bring one of the coffers beefore his preſence: out of the which hee tooke a table of .iii. foot of bredth, and ii. of length, the w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> was of <hi>Eban,</hi> bordered al about with vnycorne. And it was cloſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> .2. lyds, very fine of red wood, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they cal raſing, of a tree where the <hi>Phenix</hi> (as they ſay) breedeth, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> dyd grow in <hi>Arabia,</hi> And as there is but one onely <hi>Phenix,</hi> ſo in the world is there but one onely tree of that ſorte. On the vttermoſt part of the table, was grauen the God Iupiter, &amp; on the other y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goddeſſe <hi>Venus:</hi> &amp; in the other was drawen the God <hi>Mars,</hi> &amp; the goddeſſe <hi>Diana.</hi> In the vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table was carued a bull: &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neythermoſt part was drawne a kyng. And they ſayd the paynter of ſo famous &amp; renowmed a woork, was called <hi>Apelles.</hi> The Emperor takyng the table in his hands, caſting his eies vnto his ſonne, ſayd theſe woords. Thou ſeeſt my ſonne, how from the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyls of fortune I haue eſcaped, &amp; how I into miſerable deſtenies of death doo enter, where by experience I ſhall know what there is after this lyfe. I meane not now to blaſpheme the gods: but to repent my ſinnes. But I would willingly declare why y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods haue created vs, ſince there is ſuch trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in life, &amp; ſuch paine in death. Not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding why the gods haue vſed ſo great cruelti w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> creatures, I ſee it now, in that after .lxii. yeres I haue ſayled in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daunger &amp; peril of this life: now they commaund mee to land, &amp; harbour in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue of death. Now approcheth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houre wherin y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> band of matrimoni is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:21411:280"/>
loſed, the thred of life vntwined, the key dooth lock, the ſlepe is wakened, my lyfe dooth end, &amp; I go out of this troubleſome paine. Remembring mee of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue doone in my lyfe, I deſire no more to liue: but for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I know not why<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther I am caryed by death, I feare &amp; refuſe his darts. Alas what ſhal I doo, ſince y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods tel mee not what I ſhal doo? what cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſail ſhal I take of any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſince no man will accompany mee in this iourney? O what great diſceite, o what manifeſt blindnes is this, to loue one thing al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> days of his life, &amp; to call nothing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs after our death? Beecauſe I deſired to bee rych, they let mee dy poore. Bycauſe I deſired to lyue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> company, they let mee dy alone. For ſuch ſhortnes of life, I know not what hee is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wyl haue a houſe, ſince the narow graue is our certain manſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place? beeleeue mee, my ſonne, that many things paſt doo greeue mee ſore: but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nothing ſo much I am troubled, as to come ſo late to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of this life. For if I could perfectly beeleeue this, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould men haue cauſe to reproue mee, neither yet I now ſuch occaſion to lament mee. O how certaine a thing is it, that men when they come to the point of death, doo promiſe the gods, that if they proroge their death, they will amend their life? but notwithſtanding, I am ſory that wee ſee them deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from death, without any maner of amendment of life. They haue obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that, which of the gods they haue deſired: &amp; haue not perfourmed that, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they haue promiſed. They ought aſſuredly to think, that in the ſweeteſt time of their lyfe, they ſhall bee conſtreyned to accept death. For admit that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ingrate perſons bee deferred: yet therfore the fault is not pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Bee thou aſſured my ſonne, that I haue ſeene enough, hard, felt, taſted, deſired, poſſeſſed, eaten, ſlept, ſpoken, and alſo liued inough. For vices geeue as great trouble, to thoſe which follow them much: as they doo great deſire, to thoſe which neuer proued them. I confeſſe to the immortall Gods, that I haue no deſire to lyue: yet I enſure thee, I would not dye. For life is ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome that it weareth vs: &amp; death is ſo doubtfull, that it feareth vs. If the gods deferred my death, I doubt whyther I ſhould reforme my life. And if I doo not amend my lyfe, nor ſerue the Gods better, nor profit the common wealth more, &amp; if that euery tyme I am ſick, it ſhould greeue me to die: I ſay it is much better for mee now to accept death, then, to wyſh the lengthning of my life. I ſay the life is ſo troubleſome, ſo fyckle, ſo ſuſpicious, ſo vncertayne, &amp; ſo importunat (finally I ſay, it is a life whithout lyfe) that hee is an obſtinat foole, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſo much deſireth it. Come y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that may come: for finally, not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue ſpoken, I willingly commit my ſelfe into the hands of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gods, ſince of neceſſity I am thereunto conſtreined. For it proceedeth not of a lytle wiſedom, to receiue that willingly, which to doo wee are conſtrayned of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. I will not recommend my ſelf to the prieſts, nor cauſe the oracles to bee viſited, nor promiſe any thing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> temples, nor offer ſacrifices to the gods, to the end they ſhould warrant mee from death, and reſtore mee to lyfe: but I will demaund, and require them, that if they haue created mee for any good thing, I may not looſe it for my euyll lyfe. So wiſe and ſage are the gods in that they ſay, ſo iuſt &amp; true in that they promiſe, that if they geeue vs not that which wee others would: it is not for that they wil not, but beecauſe wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it not. For wee are ſo euyl, and woorth ſo litel, and wee may doo ſo lytel, that for many good woorks wee deſerue no meryt: and yet with an euil
<pb facs="tcp:21411:281"/>
worke, wee bee made vnworthy of al. Since therfore I haue put my ſelfe in to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of the Gods, let them doo with mee what they wil for their ſeruice: for in the ende, the woorſt that they will doo is much better then the world wil doo. For all that the world hath geeuen mee, hath beene but mockry, and deceyte: but that which the gods haue geeuen mee, I haue gouerned, and poſſeſſed without ſuſpicion. For this laſt houre (my ſonne) I haue kept the beſt, the moſt noble, and riches iewell that I haue poſſeſſed in my life tyme. And I doo proteſt vnto the immortal gods, that if as they doo commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mee to dye, they would geeue mee lycence to rede in the graue: I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund it to bee buryed with mee. Thou ſhalt know my ſonn, that in the .x. yeare of my Empire, a great warr aroſe agaynſt the vnruly people of <hi>Perſia,</hi> where by euyll luck it was appoynted for mee, in perſon to geeue the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle: the which wonne, and al their country deſtroyed, I returned by the old city of <hi>Thebes</hi> in <hi>Aegipte,</hi> to ſee if I could finde any antiquity of thoſe in times paſt. In the houſe of an Egiptian pryeſt, I found a litel table, which they ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the gate of the kynges pallace the day of his coronatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And this poore priſtes told mee, that that which was in this table, was writen by a king of Egypt, named <hi>Ptholomeus Arſaſides.</hi> I beeſeech the immortal Gods, my ſonne, that ſuch bee thy woorks, as the woords of this table require. As em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, I leaue thee heire of many realmes: and as a father, I geeue thee this table of counſayles. The woords which the fathers doo teach vnto the chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at the laſt houre, the children ought to keepe continually in their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye. Let this therefore bee my laſt woord, with the Empire thou ſhalt bee feared through out all the world: and with the counſayles of this table, thou ſhalt bee loued of al nations. This talk beeing ended, and the table geeuen, the Emperor turned his eyes, loſt his ſenſes, and for the ſpace of a quarter of an houre lay languiſhing in extreame payne, &amp; within a while after yelded vp the ghoſt. In this table weare certain greeke letters which were in meeter and in our tonge ſignify thus.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He famous Philoſopher <hi>Plato,</hi> beeſought of al his diſciples to tel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why hee iornyed ſo oft from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Scicille,</hi> beeing the way hee tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled (in deede) very long, and the ſea hee paſſed very daungerous: aunſwered them thus. The cauſe that moues mee to goe from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Scicille,</hi> is only to ſee <hi>Phocion,</hi> a man iuſtinal that hee dooth, and wiſe in all that hee ſpeaketh: and beecauſe hee is my very frend, and enemy of <hi>Denys,</hi> I goe alſo willingly to him, to ayd him in that I may, and to councell him in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I know: and told them further. I doo you to weete my diſciples, that a good philoſopher, to viſit and help his frend, and to accompany with a good man, ſhoold think the iorney ſhort, and no whit paynfull, though hee ſhoold ſulk the whole ſeas, and pace the compaſe of the earth. <hi>Appolonius Thianeus</hi> departed from Rome, went through all <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſayled ouer the great flud <hi>Nile,</hi> endured the bitter cold of mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> ſuffered the parching heat of the mountayns <hi>Riphei,</hi> paſſed the land of <hi>Naſſagera,</hi> &amp; entred into the great <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia:</hi> And this long pilgrimage tooke hee vppon him, in no other reſpect, but to ſee <hi>Hyarcus</hi> the philoſopher, his great and old frend. <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> alſo among the Greekes accompted a woorthy Captayn, vnderſtanding that the kyng <hi>Hycarius</hi> had an other captayn (his very frend) captyue: leauing all his own affayres apart, traueling through dyuers countreis, went to the place where hee was, and arryued there, preſented him ſelf vnto the kyng, and ſaid thus to him. I humbly beeſeech thee O puiſſant king, thou deigne to pardon <hi>Minotus,</hi> my ſole and only frend, and thy ſubiect now: for what thou ſhalt doo to him, make thy account thou haſt doon it to mee. For in deed thou canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer alone puniſh his body, but thou ſhalt therewith alſo crucify my hart.</p>
                  <p>Kyng <hi>Herod</hi> after <hi>Auguſtus</hi> had ouercome <hi>Mark Antony,</hi> came to Rome, and laying his crown at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Imperiall feete, with ſtout corage ſpake theſe woords vnto him. Know thou (mighty <hi>Auguſtus</hi>) if thou knowſt it not, that if <hi>Mark Antony</hi> had beeleeued mee, and not his accurſed loue <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> thou ſhooldſt then haue proued how bitter an enemy I woold haue been to thee, and hee haue found how true a frend I was, and yet am to him. But hee, as a man rather geeuen ouer to the rule of a womans will, then guyded by reaſons ſkill, tooke of mee but money only, and of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> counſell. And proceeding further ſayd: Lo here my kingdom, my perſon, and royall crown layd at thy princely feete, all which I freely offer to thee, to diſpoſe of at thy will &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, pleaſing thee ſo to accept it, but yet with this condicion (inuict <hi>Auguſtꝰ</hi>) that thou commaund mee not to here nor ſpeak yll of <hi>Mark Antony</hi> my lord and frend, yea although hee were now dead. For know thou, ſacred prince, that true frends, neither for death ought to bee had in obliuio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor for abſens to bee forſaken. <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> laſt dictator and firſt emperor of Rome, dyd ſo entierly loue <hi>Cornelius Fabatus</hi> the conſull, that traueling togethers through the alps of Fraunce and beeing beenighted, farre from any town or harber, ſaue that only of a hollow caue, which happely they lighted on: And <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> the conſull euen then not well at eaſe, <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> left him the whole caue
<pb facs="tcp:21411:283"/>
to thend hee might bee more at reſt, and hee him ſelf lay abroad in the cold &amp; ſnow. By theſe goodly examples wee haue reſited, and by dyuers others wee coold reſite, may bee conſidered, what faithfull frendſhip ought to bee bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt true and perfect frends, and into how many daungers one frend ought to put him ſelf for an other. For it is not enough that one frend bee ſory for the troubles of an other, but hee is bound (if neede were) to goe and dye ioyfully wyth him. Hee only deſeruedly may bee counted a true frend, that vnaſked, and beefore hee bee called, goeth with his goods and perſon to help and releeue his frend. But in this our yron age alas there is no ſuch kynd of amity as that wee haue ſpoken of. More then this, that there is no frend will part with any thing of his to releeue his frend, much leſſe that taketh care to fauor him in his trobles: but if there bee any ſuch that will help hys frend, yt is euen then when tyme ſerueth rather to pity and lament him, then to ayd or ſuccor him. It is a thing woorth the knowledge, that to make a true and perpetuall frendſhip, wee may not offer to many perſons, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Seneca</hi> his ſaying, who ſaith. My frend <hi>Lucillus,</hi> I councell thee that thou bee a true frend to one alone, and enemy to none: for nombers of frends brings great incumbrance, which ſeemeth ſomewhat to diminiſh frendſhip. For who that conſidereth the liberty of the hart, it is impoſſible that one ſhoold frame and agree wyth the condicions of many, and much leſſe that many ſhoold content them with the deſiers and affections of one. <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Saluſt</hi> were two famous orators amongſt the Romayns, and great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies beetwene them ſelues, and duryng thys emulation beetweene them, <hi>Tully</hi> had purchaſed all the Senators frendſhip, and <hi>Saluſt</hi> only had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frend in all Rome, but <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> alone. And ſo theſe two great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators beeing one day at woords togeethers, <hi>Tully</hi> in great anger ſayd to <hi>Saluſt:</hi> what force or power art thou of, or what canſt thou doo or attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mee? ſith thou knowſt that in all Rome thou haſt but one only frend, <hi>Mark Antony,</hi> and I no enemy but one, and that is hee? To whom <hi>Saluſt</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Thou glorieſt (O <hi>Tully</hi>) that thou haſt no mo but one only enemy, and afterwards ieſts at mee, that I haue no more frends but only one: but I hope in the immortall Gods, that this only enemy thou haſt, ſhalbee able enough vtterly to vndoo thee: and this my ſole frend that I haue, ſhalbee ſufficient to protect and defend mee in al my cauſes. And ſhortly after theſe woords paſſed beetween them, <hi>Mark Antony</hi> ſhewed the frendſhip hee bare to the one, and the enimity hee had to the other, for hee cauſed <hi>Tully</hi> to bee put to death, and rayſed <hi>Saluſt</hi> to great honor. A frend may well impart to the other all his own, as bread, wyne, money, tyme, conuerſation, and ſuch lyke, but hee cannot notwithſtandyng geeue him part of his hart, for that ſuffereth it not to bee parted nor deuyded, beecauſe it can bee geeuen but to one alone. This graunted to bee true, as needs it muſt doubtles, that the hart can not bee deuyded but only geeuen to one, then is it of neceſſity, that hee that will ſeeke to haue many frends, muſt needs repair to the ſhambels to prouyde him of many harts. Many vaunt them ſelues, and think it a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to haue nombers of frends, but let ſuch well conſider to what vſe that le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendary of frends do ſerue them, they ſhall then eaſely fynd they ſtand them in no other ſteed, but to eat, to drink, to walk, to babble, and to murmure
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:21411:283"/>
togeethers, and not one to help the other with their goods, fauor, and credit at their neede, nor frendly to reprooue them of their faults and vyces, whych doubtles ought not to bee ſo. For where true and perfect frendſhip rayg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, neither I wiſh my frend, nor hee with mee ſhoold diſſemble any fault or vyce. <hi>Ouide</hi> ſayth in his booke <hi>de arte amandi,</hi> that the law of true &amp; vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned loue is ſo ſtreight, that no frendſhip but myne in thy hart ſhoold herber, and in myne ſhoold lodge none others loue but thine, for loue is none other thing but one hart lyuing in two bodies, &amp; two bodies obeying one hart. In this world there is no treaſure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parable to a true &amp; ſure frend, ſyth to a faith full frend a man may ſafely diſcouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecrets of hys hart, beewray vnto him hys gryping greeues, truſting him with his honor, comitting to his guyd &amp; cuſtody all his goods, hee ſhall ſuccor him in his miſery, counſell him in peril, reioyce at his proſperity, and mourn at his aduerſity: and in fyne I conclude, ſuch a frend neuer werieth to ſerue him in his lyfe, nor to lament him after his death. I graunt that gold and ſiluer is good, kynſfolks are good, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is good, but true frends exceede them all without compariſon. For all theſe things cannot warrant vs from neceſſitie (if ſyniſter fortune plunge vs into it) but rather encreaſe our torment and extremitie: Alſo they doo not reioyce vs, but rather heap further greefes vppon vs, neither doo they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor vs, but rather ech hour geeue vs cauſe to complayn, much leſſe doo they remember and aduiſe vs of that that is good, but ſtill doo deceiue vs, not dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectyng vs the right way, but ſtill bringing vs out of our way, and when they haue lead vs awry out of the high way, they bring vs into deſert woods, and hygh and daungerous mountayns, whereof neceſſity wee muſt fal down hedlong. A true frend is no partaker of theſe conditions, but rather hee ys ſory for the leſt trouble that happeneth to hys frend, hee feareth not, neither ſpareth hys goods, nor the daunger of his perſon, hee careth not to take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon hym any painfull iorney, quarels, or ſutes, nor yet to put his lyfe in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry haſard of death. And yet that that is moſt of all to bee eſteemed is, that lyke as the hart and bowels euer burn with pure and ſincere loue, ſo dooth hee wiſh and deſire wyth gladſome mynd, to bere the burthen of all hys frends miſhaps, yea more then yet ſpoken of. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great offered great preſents to the Philoſopher <hi>Zenocrates,</hi> who woold not vouchſafe to receiue them, much leſſe to beehold them. And beeing demaunded of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> why hee woold not receyue them, hauyng poore kinſfolks and parents to beeſtow them on: hee aunſwered him thus. Truely I haue both brothers and ſiſters (O <hi>Alexander</hi>) yet I haue no kinſman but him that is my frend, and one only frend I haue, who hath no neede of any gyfts to bee geeuen him. For the only cauſe why I chooſe him to bee my ſole and only frend, was for that I euer ſaw him deſpiſe theſe worldly things. Truely the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of this good philoſopher <hi>Zenocrates</hi> is of no ſmall efficacy, for him that will aduyſedly conſider of it, ſith that not ſeeldom but many times it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that the great troubles, the ſundry daungers, and the continuall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and miſeries wee ſuffer in this vale of miſery, haue for the moſt part proceeded from our parents, and afterwards by our frends haue been medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and redreſſed. Therefore ſince wee haue thought it good and neceſſary
<pb facs="tcp:21411:284"/>
to chooſe a frend, and that hee bee but one only, ech man muſt bee wiſe leſt in ſuch choiſe hee bee deceiued. For oft tymes it happeneth, that thoſe that take litle regard herein, graunt their frendſhip to ſuch one as is to couetous, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacient, a great babbler, ſeditious, and preſumptuous, and of ſuch condicions that ſometyme it ſhoold bee leſſe euil for vs to haue him our enemy, then to account of him as of our deere frend. Him whom wee wil chooſe for our faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full frend, amongſt other maners and condicions hee muſt chiefely and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all bee indued with theſe, that hee bee curteous of nature, faier ſpoken, hard and ſtout to indure payn, pacient in troubles, ſober in dyet, moderate in his woords, graue and rype in his counſels, and aboue all ſtedfaſt in frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and faithfull in ſecrets. And whom wee ſhall fynd with theſe laudable vertues and conditions adorned, him may wee ſafely take and accept for our frend. But if wee ſee any of theſe parts wanting in him, wee ought to ſhon him as from the plague, knowing for certeinty, that the frendſhip of a fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fantaſticall frend is much woorſe and perilous, then the enmity of a knowen and open enemy. For to the hands of one wee commit our hart, and faith: and from the deceipts and treaſons of the other, wee defendour ſelues with our whole force &amp; power. <hi>Seneca</hi> wryting to his deere &amp; faithful frend <hi>Lucillus</hi> ſayth vnto hym. I pray thee (O <hi>Lucillus</hi>) that thou order &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyne thine affaiers by thaduiſe &amp; counſel of thy frend, but alſo I doo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee, that firſt thou ſee well what maner of frend thou haſt choſen thee, for there is no marchandiſe in the world this day that men are ſo ſoone beegyled in, as they are in the choiſe of frends. Therefore the graue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Seneca</hi> wyſely wayed, wee ſhoold aſſent with him in oppinion, that ſith no man byeth a horſe but hee firſt cauſeth him to bee ridden, nor bread but firſt hee ſeeth and handleth it, nor wyne but hee taſteth it, nor fleſh but firſt hee wayeth it, nor corne but hee ſeeth a ſample, nor houſe but that hee dooth firſt value it, nor Inſtrument but firſt hee playeth on it, and iudgeth of his ſound: yt is but reaſon hee ſhoold bee ſo much the more circumſpect bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he chooſe his frend to examin his lyfe and condicion, ſince all the other things wee haue ſpoken of may bee put in dyuers houſes and corners, but our frend wee lodge and keepe deerely in our proper bowels. Thoſe that write of the emperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſay, that hee was very ſtraunge and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in accepting frends, but after hee had once receyued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into his frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, hee was very conſtant and circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpect to keepe them. For hee neuer had any frend, but firſt hee had ſome proofe and tryall of him, neither woold hee euer after forſake him for any diſpleaſure doon to him. Therefore yt ſhoold always bee ſo, that true frends ſhoold bere one to an other ſuch loue and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that the one beeing in proſperity, ſhould not haue occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playn of him ſelf in that hee did not reliue his frends neceſſity beeing in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity: nor the other beeing poore and needy, ſhoold grudge or lament for that his frend beeing rich and welthy, woold not ſuccor him with all that hee might haue doone for him. For to ſay the truth, where perfect frendſhyp is, there ought no excuſe to bee made to doo what poſſible is the one for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The frendſhip of young men cometh commonly, (or for the moſt parte at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt) by beeing companyons in vyce and folly: and ſuch of right ought
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21411:284"/>
rather to bee called vacabonds, then once to deſerue the name of true frends. For that cannot bee called true frendſhip, that is continued to the preiudyce or derogation of vertue. <hi>Seneca</hi> wryting agayn to <hi>Lucillus</hi> ſayth theſe woords. I woold not haue thee think, nor once miſtruſt, O my <hi>Lucillus,</hi> that in all the Romayn empire I haue any greater frend then thou: but with all aſſure thy ſelf, that our frendſhip is not ſo ſtreight beetwene vs, that I woold take vppon mee at any tyme to doo for thee otherwyſe then honeſty ſhoold lead mee. For though the loue I bere thee hath made thee lord of my lyberty: yet reaſon alſo hath left mee vertue free.</p>

                     <p>Applyeng that wee haue ſpoken to that wee will now declare, I ſay I wil not acknowledge my ſelf your ſeruant, for ſo ſhoold I bee compelled to feare you more then loue you: much leſſe will I vaunt my ſelf to bee your kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for ſo I ſhoold importune and diſpleaſe you: and I will not brag that heeretofore wee haue been of familier acquaintance, for that I woold not make any demonſtration I made ſo lyttle account of you, and leſſe then I am bound to doo: neither will I boſt my ſelf that I am at this preſent your famyliar and welbeeloued, for in deede I ſhoold then ſhew my ſelf to bee to bold and arrogant: but that that I will confeſſe ſhalbee, that I loue you as a frend, and you mee as a kinſman, al bee it this frendſhip hath ſucceeded dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly tyll now. For you beeing noble as you are, haue bountifully ſhewed your frendſhip to mee, in large and ample gyfts: but I poore, and of baſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, haue only made you ſure of myne in woords. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes ſayd: That it were farre better to ſell to our frends our woorks and good deeds, (whether they were in proſperity, aduerſity, or neceſſity) then to feede them with vayn flattering woords for nothing. Yet is it not ſo general a rule, but that ſometymes it happeneth that the high woords on the one ſyde are ſo profitable, and the woorks ſo few and feeble on the other ſyde, that one ſhalbee better pleaſed and delighted with hearing the ſweete and curteous woords of thone, then hee ſhalbee to bee ſerued with the cold ſeruyce and woorks of the other, of ſmall profyt and value. <hi>Plutarch</hi> alſo in his booke <hi>De animalibus</hi> telleth vs, that <hi>Denis</hi> the tyrant beeing one day at the table reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of dyuers and ſundry matters with <hi>Chriſippꝰ</hi> the philoſopher, it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that as hee was at diner, one brought him a preſent of certen ſuger cakes, wherefore <hi>Chriſippus</hi> ceſing his former diſcours fell to perſwade <hi>Denys</hi> to fall to his cakes. To whom <hi>Denys</hi> aunſwered, on with your matter <hi>Chriſippus,</hi> and leaue not of ſo: For my hart is better contented wyth thy ſweet and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred woords, then my tong is pleaſed with the delycate taſt of theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn cakes. For as thou knoweſt, theſe cakes are heauy of digeſtion, and doo greatly annoy the ſtomake: but good woords doo maruelouſly reioyce and comfort the hart. For this cauſe <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had the poet <hi>Homer</hi> in greater veneration, beeing dead, then all the other that were alyue in hys tyme: not for that <hi>Homer</hi> euer did him ſeruyce, or that hee knew him, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beecauſe of his lerned bookes hee wrote and compyled, and for the graue ſentences hee found therein. And therefore hee bare about him in the day tyme the booke of the famous deedes of <hi>Troy</hi> (called the <hi>Illiades</hi>) hanged at
<pb facs="tcp:21411:285"/>
his neck within hys boſom: &amp; in the night hee layd it vnder his bolſter, at hys beddes head where hee ſlept. In recompence therefore (ſyr) of the many good turns I haue receiued at your hands, I was alſo willyng to compyle and dedicate this my lytle treatiſe to you, the which I preſent you wyth all my deſyres, my ſtudyes, my watches, my ſwett, and my troubles, holding my ſelf fully ſatiſfyed for all the payns I haue taken, ſo that this my ſimple tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell bee gratefull to you (to whom I offer yt) and to the publyke weale profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Beeing well aſſured, if it pleaſe you to truſt mee and credyte my wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng, you ſhall manifeſtly know how freely I ſpeak to you, and lyke a frend, and not deceiue you as a flatterer. For if the beeloued and fauored of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces chaunce to bee caſt out of fauor, it is beecauſe euery man flattereth hym and ſeeketh to pleaſe him and no man goeth about to tell him troth, nor that that is for his honor, and fitteſt for him. <hi>Saluſt</hi> in his booke of the warres of <hi>Iugurtha</hi> ſayth, that the hygh heroycall facts and noble deedes were of no leſſe glory to the hiſtoriographer that wrote them, then they were to the captayn that dyd them. For it happeneth many tymes that the Captayn dying in the battell hee hath woone, lyueth afterwards notwythſtandyng by the fame of his noble attempt, and this proceedeth not only of the valyaunt deedes of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes hee was ſeene doo; but alſo for that wee read of him in woorthy authors which haue amply written thereof. Wee may well ſay therefore touching this matter, that aſwell may wee take hym for a true frend, that geeueth good counſell: as hee whych dooth vs great pleaſure, and ſeruyce. For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the oppinion of the good <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> who ſayd to his ſecretary <hi>Panutius,</hi> that a man with one pay, may make full ſatiſfaccion and recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of many pleaſures and good turns ſhewed: but to requyte a good counſell, dyuers thanks and infinite ſeruices are requiſite. If wee wil credit the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hiſtoriographers wee ſhall fynd it true, that the vertuous emperors, the fortunate kyngs, and the valyaunt Captains, when they ſhoold enterpriſe to goe conquer their enemies, either they ſought for ſome philoſopher, or they chooſe ſome other honeſt learned man, of whom they tooke councel touching all their affayrs, beefore they preſt any ſoldiers. Comparing the tymes paſt, with the tymes preſent, wee think (that haue read ſome what) that the tyme paſt was as pure grayn, and this now as chaffe and ſtraw: the one as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme calme and ſtill in the ſea, and this as wauering and tempeſteous: that then the fyne and pure mettall, and this now the droſſe thereof: The other the marie, and this the bones: the one the cleer day, and the other the dark night: For in theſe days in princes courts, and noble mens houſes, they glory more to haue a ſcoffing knaue or ieſter to make them laugh, then they recken of a graue and wyſe man to geeue them counſell. <hi>Alexander</hi> the great in all hys warres woold always bee accompanyed with the wyſe <hi>Ariſtotle. Cyrus</hi> kyng of <hi>Perſia,</hi> with the philoſopher <hi>Chilo:</hi> Kyng <hi>Ptolomie</hi> wyth <hi>Pithinus</hi> the philoſopher: <hi>Pirrhus</hi> kyng of <hi>Epyre,</hi> wyth <hi>Zatirus: Auguſtus</hi> themperor wyth <hi>Symonides: Scipio</hi> thaffrican wyth <hi>Sophocles: Traian</hi> themperor wyth <hi>Plutarche,</hi> &amp; <hi>Antonius</hi> themperor wyth <hi>Gorgias:</hi> now all theſe famous princes caried not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo many learned philoſophers, to fyght in battell w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> armed weapon in hand like other their ſoldiers, but only to vſe their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel &amp; aduice.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21411:285"/>
So that the great battels they ouerthrew, and the woorthy victories they wanne, with the noble tryumphs doon, was as much by the graue counſell of theſe good and wiſe Philoſophers, as by the force of their army, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of their Captayns. The greateſt good turn and benefit one frend can doo for an other, is to know to geeue good counſell to his frend, in his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt neede: and not without cauſe I ſay to know to geeue counſell. For it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth oft tymes, that thoſe that thought to haue geeuen vs good remedy by their counſell, (wanting in deede diſcrecion and iudgement in the ſame) haue cauſed vs to runne into further daungers. And therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once demaunded of themperor <hi>Nero,</hi> what hee thought of <hi>Scipio</hi> thaffri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, &amp; <hi>Cato</hi> the cenſor, anſwered him in this maner. I think it was as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that <hi>Cato</hi> was born for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comon wealth, as <hi>Scipio</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres, for the good <hi>Cato</hi> wyth his prudent counſell expelled vice out of the wealth publike, and the other with his noble courage and great armies did euer wythſtand the force of the enemies. According to the ſaying of <hi>Seneca,</hi> let vs alſo ſay after him, that hee is very arrogant that preſumes to geeue an other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, but with all wee ſay agayn: that if the counſell bee found good hee hath geeuen to his frend in his neede and neceſſity, aſmuch praiſe deſerueth hee that gaue it, as hee that knew how to take it. Now after thexample of the auncient philoſophers, which went to the warres not to fight, but only to geeue counſell, I will (ſyr) for thoſe things that pertayn to your ſeruyce, and profit, take vppon mee the offyce of a philoſopher, and for the firſt doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of my philoſophy I ſay, that if it pleaſe you, to receiue theſe counſels whych my penne dooth write to you, at this preſent, I promiſe you, and by the faith of a chriſtian man I ſwear, that they ſhalbee ſuch excellent helps to you, for the preſeruation of your credyt and fauor you are now in, as you may bee enriched by the true and diligent ſeruice of your ſeruaunts. For if a man woold with an oth aſk the trueth of <hi>Plato, Socrates, Pithagoras, Dioge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Licurgus, Chilo, Pittachꝰ,</hi> and of <hi>Apolonius,</hi> and alſo of all the vniuerſity and company of the other philoſophers, they woold ſwere and affirm that the felicity of man conſiſteth not in great might, in great aucthority, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions: but only in deſeruing much. For the honor, fauor, and dignityes of this mortall lyfe, are more to bee praiſed and had in veneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when they are placed in a condigne and woorthy perſon: then they are beeing poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of an vnwoorthy and graceles man, allotted to hym not by vertue, but by fortune. And therefore your aucthority beeing great at this preſent, exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto by gods diuine will and prouydence, and now in the hygheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of proſperity: I woold wiſh you my good lord, leſſe then any other cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to truſt to fortunes impery. For yf the earthquakes ſooner bryng to ground the proud and ſtately Pallaces, then the mean and low how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: if ofter fall on the higheſt mountayns, the dreadfull lightnings and tempeſts, then on the loweſt hilles: if among the greater multitude of people the plagues bee rifer, then amongſt the fewer nomber: yf they vſe rather to ſpread their netts, and lay the byrdlyme on the green and thickſt bows, then on the dry and wythered ſticks, to ſnare the ſely byrds withall: If always the ſtilleſt ſeas doo foreſhew to vs a greater tempeſt following: and if that
<pb facs="tcp:21411:286"/>
long health bee a watch vnto a great and daungerous ſicknes enſuyng: by this alſo I will inferre, that thoſe that are atchiued to ſublime eſtate &amp; hygh degree are commonly more ſubiect to fall, then thoſe of mean and baſer ſort. The emperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi> on a tyme demaunded of the Poet <hi>Virgill,</hi> that hee woold teach him how hee might conſerue him ſelf in thempire, and alwayes bee acceptable to the publike weal. To whom <hi>Virgill</hi> aunſwered. I think, O mighty <hi>Ceſar,</hi> that to reigne long in thempire, thou muſt conſideratly looke into thy ſelf, examining thy lyfe and dooings: and how much thou ſhalt ſee thy ſelf excell and exceede all thoſe (of thy empire) in dignity: So much more muſt thou endeuor thy ſelf to ſurmount all others, in vertue, and we or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynes. For hee is vnwoorthy to rule a multitude, that is not chief himſelf in all vertues. Thoſe therefore that in court of princes bere office, and auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ought earneſtly to deſire and indeuour them ſelues to auoyd the fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſink of vice, and to ſeeke the cleere ſpring of vertue. For otherwiſe, they ſhalbee more defamed for one vyce or defect found in them, then honored for their office and authority they haue.</p>

                     <p>According to the ſaying of the poet <hi>Virgill</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> I am alſo of oppinion (my Lord) that you ought to bee very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and well aduiſed, in looking into your ſelf who you are, what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer you are of, what you are woorth, and what you poſſeſſe: and dooyng thus, you ſhall fynd that among your wiſe councellors you are the greateſt, among the rich, among the beſt eſteemed, among the moſt fortunat, among your ſecretories, among the rulers, amongſt all thoſe of your realm &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, you are euer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt. And therefore as you are greatſt, and ſupreme aboue them all: ſo you ought the more to force to bee the moſt vertuous of them all. For els it were againſt all reaſon, beeing the greateſt, to bee the leaſt and moſt inferior of all. For truely none ought to bee praiſed for good, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee is of power, force, poſſeſſions, wealth, much woorth, in fauor, of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, neither for any nobilitie that is in him, if theſe natural gifts bee not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compagnied with vertue &amp; good woorks. The auncient hiſtoriographers do highly commend the greatnes of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the knowledge of <hi>Ptholomie,</hi> the iuſtice of <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the clemency of <hi>Iulius Ceſar,</hi> the pacience of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> the trueth of <hi>Traian,</hi> the pity of <hi>Antonius,</hi> the temperancy of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> the continency of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and the humanity of <hi>Theodoſius:</hi> ſo that wee may ſay theſe ſo great &amp; noble princes haue wonne more honor by their vertues, then they haue atchyued by tryumphant victories. Albeeit a man bee neuer ſo diſhoneſt, vicious, and laſciuious, and that hee bee rooted in all ydlenes, let vs ſay and auouch it for a trueth, that it is impoſſible (if hee may return to looke back on him ſelf, and that hee may cal to mynd what maner of man hee hath been, what hee is at this preſent, &amp; to what end hee may come) but that the remembraunce of his forepaſſed faults and deeds, ſhoold bee more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and yrkſom to him, then the great delight his body ſhoold take of the preſent pleaſures. For neither the woorms in the vynes, nor the locuſts in the corn, nor the moths in the garments, nor the litle woorms in the wood are ſo hurtful and dommageable, as ſinnes are of power to make a man ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull. For to ſay truely, the pleaſure wee receyue when wee commyt

The whych I conſidering, my lord, yt cauſeth mee to looke ouer myne old memorials, to examyne my memory, to ſtrengthen my iudgement, and to ſeeke a new kynd of ſtudy, to no other end, but to fynd out ſweete woords, dyuers doctryns, and ſtraunge hiſtoryes, by means whereof I myght with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw you from vayn and worldly delights, to cauſe you to walk in the right path, and to affect things vertuous and honeſt, though I haue always kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen them as acceptable to you, as they haue been familier. For princes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, the more they are buſied with affairs, the leſſe they know them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. And therefore great payn ſuffereth hee, and wyth ouer venymous poyſon is hee infected, that wyth others, and for other occupyeth all hys time, and for his own ſowl health cannot ſpare a moment of tyme. O what comfort and quiet were it vnto my hart, if it were aſſured it had taken the ryght way, in the doctrine which I write to you, and that I had not erryd in the counſels I geeue you: ſo that in readyng my booke you myght acquire profit thereby, and I of my trauel therein reap my full contentation.

                     <p n="1">1 NEuer tell (my lord) to any all that you think. Shew not all that you haue. Neyther take all that you deſire: Tell not all that you know.</p>
                     <p>Much leſſe neuer doo all that you may. For the right path way to bring the fauored courtier into hys Princes diſgrace, is to bee addicted to hys ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall appetytes and vayne humors, and not to bee guyded wyth reaſon and diſcrecion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Beware alſo you truſt not, nor commit to the haſard of fortunes tickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſuch things, as touch and conſerue your parſon, honor, goods and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. For the wyſe courtier that lyueth in his princes grace, will not raſhly put him ſelf in daunger, in hope to ſaue him ſelf harmles, at all tymes when hee liſteth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Although euery man offer his ſeruice to you, and ſeeme to bee at your commaundement when you ſhall neede him: yet I tell you (ſyr) I woold not wiſh you had eyther neede of them, or of mee: For many of thoſe lyne and curious courtiers which are the firſt that offer them ſelues to draw on your ſyde, and to ſtand by you if neede bee, are commonly (at the very pinch) the firſt and redyeſt to throw ſtones at our faces.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 In other mennes matters buſy not your ſelf to much: and in your own, ſtryue not wyth tyme, but take leyſure. For lyuing after thys rule,

you ſhall long keepe your ſelf in the good and quyet eſtate you are in, and otherwiſe ſome inconuenience myght lightly fall vppon you, that ſhoold make you remember what you were wont to bee.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The imminent perill and daunger thoſe are in, which are mounted to the toppe of ſome high thyng, or to the cliffe of ſome hygh and rocky moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn, where they haue no other way to deſcend, but to fall, is much lyke to that of the famyliars of Princes. And therefore my lord, I woold wyſh you woold procure you ſuch faythfulll frends about you, that they hauyng re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and care of your perſon, ſhoold always hold you by the gown for fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng.

                     <p n="6">6 All bee it the thyngs of the ſowl ſhoold bee preferred beefore all others of thys worldly lyfe, yet neuertheleſſe I wyll bee content, ſo that you haue as great care and conſideration of your conſcience, as you haue of your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. All whych I was willyng to tell you (ſyr) to the end you may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderſtand, that thoſe that are in eſtimation with the prince, though they may benefit by tyme (in takyng their tyme) yet tyme dooth neuer benefyt by them at all.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 You muſt euer doo good to your vttermoſt power, and neuer doo dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to any, though it lye in your power, and that you haue iuſt cauſe. For the tears of the poore that are iniuryed, and the lamentable cryes and playnts of the oppreſſed, may poſſibly one day aſcend to the preſence of the tribunall ſeat (where god ſhall ſitt in his maieſty) demaundyng iuſtyce and vengeaunce agaynſt you: and alſo come to the ears of the prince, to cauſe you to bee hated of hym for euer.</p>

                     <p>For a man may lawfully make his frend partaker of hys goods, but not of hys conſcience.</p>

For al beeit in princes courts euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dooth admire and beehold the excellency and woorthynes of the perſon, yet are thoſe always that are moſt in fauor of the Prince, more noted, regarded, and ſooner accuſed then others.</p>

                     <p>Although wee ſuppoſe aſſuredly all theſe things aboue written are not lykely to happen, nor come euen ſo to paſſe as I haue ſpoken: yet may yt pleaſe you (ſyr) to remember they are not therefore impoſſible. For ſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fortune permitteth oft tymes, that the ſayles which the lyghtnyng and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:21411:287"/>
boyſterous tempeſts could not break and teare in peeces, are afterwards vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſoden, (euen in the ſweete of the mornings ſleepe, eche man taking his reſt, leauing the ſeas beefore in quiet calme) all to ſhyuered, and torn a ſunder. Hee that meaneth to geeue another a blow allſo, the more hee draweth back hys arme, with greater force hee ſtriketh. And euen ſo (neyther more nor leſſe) ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fortune with thoſe, on whom for a time ſhee ſmyleth. For the lenger a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remaineth in her loue and fauor, the more cruel and bitter ſhee ſheweth her ſelf to him in the end. And therefore I woold aduiſe euery wiſe and ſage per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that when fortune ſeemes beſt of all to fauor him, and to doo moſt for him, that then hee ſhould ſtand moſt in feare of her, and leaſt truſt her deceipts. Therefore (Sir) make no ſmall accompt of this my booke, litle though it bee. For you know, that doubtles (as experience teacheth vs) of greater price &amp; value is a litle ſpark of a Dyamond, then a greater ballaſſe. It forceth lyttle that the booke bee of ſmall or great volume, ſyth thexcellency thereof conſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not in the number of leaues, more or leſſe, but only in the good and graue ſentences that are amplie writen therein. For euery author that writeth, to make his booke of great price and ſhew, ought to bee brief in his woords, and ſweete and pleaſant in his matter hee treateth of, the better to ſatiſfy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mynd of the reader, and alſo not to bee tedious to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearer. And (Sir) I ſpeak not without cauſe that you ſhoold not a lytle eſteeme this ſmall treatiſe of myne, ſince you are moſt aſſured, that with tyme al your things ſhall haue end, your frends ſhall leaue you, your goods ſhalbee deuided, your ſelf ſhall dye, your fauor and credyt ſhall dimyniſh, and thoſe that ſucceede you, ſhal forget you, you not knowing to whom your goods and patrimony ſhall come: and aboue all, you ſhall not know what condicions your heires and children ſhallbee of. But for this I write in your Royall hiſtory and Chronicle of your lawdable vertues and perfections, and for that alſo I ſerue you as I doo with this my preſent woork, the memory of you ſhall remain eternized to your Succeſſors for euer. <hi>Chilo</hi> the philoſopher beeyng demaunded whether there were any thing in the world that fortune had not power to bring to nought, aunſwered in this ſort. Two things onely there are, which neyther tyme can conſume, nor fortune diſtroy, and that is: the renowne of man wrytten in bookes, and the veritie that is hidden. For allthough troth for a tyme lye interred, yet yt reſurgeth agayn and receyueth lyfe, appearing manyfeſtly to all. And euen ſo in like caſe the vertues wee fynd wryten of a man, doo cauſe vs at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to haue him in as great veneration, as thoſe had in his tyme that beſt knew him. Read therefore (Sir) at times I beeſeech you theſe wrytyngs of myne, allbeeit I feare mee you can ſcant borrow a moment of tyme with ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure once to looke vppon yt, beeing (as I know you are) allways occupyed in affaires of great importaunce, wherein mee thinketh you ſhoold not ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge your ſelf, but that you myght for your commodyty and recreacion of your ſpirits reſerue ſome pryuat howers to your ſelf. For ſage and wiſe men ſhould not ſo burden them ſelues with care of others toyle, that they ſhould not ſpend one hower of the day at the leaſt (at their pleaſure) to looke on their eſtate and condicion. As recou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth <hi>Suctonius Tranquillus</hi> of <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> who notwythſtandyng his quotydian warres hee had, neuer let ſlypt one day but that hee read, or wrote ſome thing. So that beeing in his Pauyllyon in the
<pb facs="tcp:21411:288"/>
camp in the one hand hee held his launce to aſſault his enemy, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the penne to wryte with all, with which hee wrote his woorthy comen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries. The reaſonable man therefore calling to mynd the ſtreight account y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee muſt render of him ſelf and of the time hee hath loſt, ſhal always bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re careful that hee loſe not his time, then hee ſhalbee to keepe his treaſure. For the wel imployed time is a mean &amp; help to his ſaluation: &amp; the euil gotten good a cauſe of his eternal da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation. More ouer yet, what toyle and trauayl is it to the body of the man, &amp; how much more perill to the liuing ſoule, when hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth his hole days and life in wordly broile: and yet ſeely man hee can not abſent him ſelf from that vile drudgery, till death dooth ſommon him to yeeld vp his accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his lief and dooings. And now to conclude my prologue, I ſay this booke is deuided into two parts: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to weete: in the firſt tenne chapters is declared how the new come courtier ſhall beehaue him ſelf in the princes court to winne fauor &amp; credit with the prince: &amp; the ſurplus of the woork trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, when hee hath atcheeued to his princes fauor, &amp; acquired the credyt of a worthy courtier: how hee ſhal then continew the ſame to his further aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cement. And I doubt no whit, but that my lords &amp; gentlemen of court wil ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke pleaſure to read it, and namely ſuch as are princes familiars and beeloued of court ſhall moſtly reap profyt thereby, putting the good leſſons &amp; aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they fynd heretofore writen, in execucion. For, to the yong courtiers it ſheweth them what they haue to doo: &amp; putteth in remembraunce alſo the old fauored courtier (lyuing in his princes grace) of that hee hath to bee circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpect of. And fynally I conclude (ſir) that of al the treaſors, riches, gyfts, fauors, proſperities, pleaſures, ſeruices, greatnes, &amp; power, that you haue &amp; poſſeſſe in this mortal &amp; tranſitory life, &amp; by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of a chriſtian I ſweare vnto you alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you ſhal cary no more with you, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> onely time w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> you haue wel &amp; vertuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emploied, during this your pilgrimage.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21411:288"/>
and if they woold deny them, they ſhould aſſure them ſelues they woold come to demaund them with ſweord in hand.

As <hi>Ptholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meus Philadelphus</hi> kyng of <hi>Egipt,</hi> not contented to bee ſo wiſe in al ſciences as hee was, nor to haue in his library .8000. bookes as hee had, nor to ſtudy at the leaſt .4. howers in the day, nor ordinaryly to diſpute at his meales wyth philoſophers, ſent neuertheles an imbaſſage of noble men to the Ebrews, to deſire them they woold bee contented to ſend him ſome of the beſt lerned and wiſeſt men among them, to teach him the Ebrew tongue, &amp; to read to him the bookes of their laws. When <hi>Alexander</hi> the great was born, his father kyng <hi>Phillippe</hi> wrote a notable letter immediatly to <hi>Ariſtottle,</hi> &amp; among other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hee wrote there were theſe. I doo thee to weete, O greateſt philoſopher <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (if thou knowſt it not) that <hi>Olimpias</hi> my wife is brought to bed of a ſonne, for w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> inceſſantly I geeue the gods immortal thanks: not ſo much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue a ſonne, as for that they haue geeuen him mee in thy tyme. For I am aſſured hee ſhal profit more with the doctrine thou ſhalt teach him: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee ſhal preuail with the kingdoms I ſhal leaue him after mee. Now by the examples aboue recited, and by many more we coold alledge, wee may eaſly conſider, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what reuerence and honor the auncient kyngs vſed the learned and vertuous men of their tyme. And wee may alſo more playnly ſee it, ſyth then they held in greater price and eſtimacion the bones of a dead philoſopher, then they doo now the doctrine of the beſt learned of our time. And not without iuſt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dyd theſe famous &amp; heroycal princes ioy, to haue at home in their houſes, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode with them in the feeld, ſuch wiſe &amp; learned men whilſt they liued, &amp; after they were dead to honor their bones and carcaſes: and in dooing this they er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not a iot. For who ſo euer accompanieth continually w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> graue &amp; wiſe men, enioyeth this benefit and priuiledge beefore others, that hee ſhall neuer bee
<pb facs="tcp:21411:289"/>
counted ignorant of any. Therefore continuing ſtill our fyrſt purpoſe, let vs ſay, that who ſo euer will profeſſe the company of ſober and wiſe men, yt can not otherwiſe bee, but hee muſt maruelouſly profyt by their comapny. For beeing in their company they will put all vain and diſhoneſt thoughts from him, they will teach him to ſubdue and reſyſt all ſodein paſſions and motions moued of choller: by them they ſhal winne good frends, and learn alſo neuer to bee troubleſome or enemy to any, they will make him forſake all ſinne and vice, declaring to him what good woorks hee ſhall follow, and what hee ſhal moſt fly and eſchew: they will let him vnderſtand how hee ſhall humble and beehaue him ſelf in proſperity, and they will alſo comfort him in his aduerſity, to keepe him from all ſorow and diſpayre. For though a man bee neuer ſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refull and circumſpect, yet hath hee always neede of the councell of an other in his affaires, if therefore ſuch perſon haue not about him good vertuous, &amp; ſage men, how can it otherways bee but that hee muſt ſtumble oft, and fall down right on his face, hauing no man to ayd or help him. <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> ſayeth, that albeeit the <hi>Affricans</hi> were wylde and brutiſh people, yet had they withſtandyng a law amongſt them, that the ſenators amongſt them coold chooſe no other ſenator, if at the electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there were not preſent a philoſopher. So it happened one day amongſt the reſt, that of many philoſophers they had in <hi>Carthage,</hi> amongſt them was one named <hi>Apolonius:</hi> Who ruled for the ſpace of three ſcore and two years all their ſenat with great quyet, and to the contentacion of all the ſenators: which to ſhew them ſelues thankfull to him, erected in the market place ſo many images of him, as he had gouerned their common weale years, to the end the fame and memory of hym ſhould bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall: and yet they dyd dedycate to their famous <hi>Anniball</hi> but onely one i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and to this philoſopher they ſet vp aboue three ſcore. <hi>Alexander</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great when hee was moſt bent to bluddy warres, went to ſee and ſpeak with <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> the philoſoper, offring him great preſents, and diſcourſyng with him of dyuers matters. So that wee may iuſtly ſay, this good prince of hym ſelf tooke payns to ſeek out wiſe men to accompany him, electing by others choiſe and aduiſe all ſuch, as hee made his captayns to ſerue him in the warres: It is manyfeſt to all, that <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the <hi>Siracuſan</hi> was the greateſt tyraunt in the world, and yet notwithſtanding his tyranny, it is a wonder to ſee the ſage and wiſe men hee had continually in his court with him: &amp; that, that makes vs yet more to wonder of him is, that hee had them not about him to ſerue him, or to profyt one iot by their doctrine and councell: but onely for his honor, and their profyt, which enforceth mee to ſay, concurring with this example, that ſyth tyrants dyd glory to haue about them wiſe, &amp; woorthy men: much more ſhoold thoſe reioyce, that in their woorks and deedes are noble, and free harted. And this they ought to doo, not onely to bee honored with them openly, but alſo to bee holpen with their doctrine &amp; councels ſecretly. And if to ſome this ſhoold ſeeme a hard thyng to follow, wee will ſay: that woorthy men not beeing of ability and power to mainteyn ſuch wiſe men, ought yet at leaſt to vſe to read at tymes, good and vertuous bookes. For by readyng of bookes, they reap infynyt profyt, as for example, by readyng as I ſay theſe good authors, the deſire is ſatiſfyed, their iugement is quickned idlenes is put away, the hart is diſburdened, the time is well imployed, and they lead their lyfe vertuouſly, not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21411:289"/>
beeing bound to render account of ſo many faults, as in that tyme they my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght haue committed. And to conclude, it is ſo good an exerciſe, as it gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth good examples to the neyghbor, profyt to hym ſelf, and health to the ſoule. Wee ſee by experience, after a man taketh vppon hym once the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of holy ſcriptures, and that hee frameth hym ſelf to bee a diuyne, hee will neuer wyllyngly thencefoorth deale in other ſtudies, and all beecauſe hee will not forgoe the great pleaſure hee receyueth to read thoſe holly ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yngs. And that cauſeth, that wee ſee ſo many learned and wiſe men (for the more part) ſubiect to dyuers diſeaſes, and full of melancoly humors. For ſo ſweete is the delight they take in their bookes, that they forget and leaue al other bodely pleaſure: And therefore <hi>Plutarke</hi> wryteth, that certayn Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers beeing one day met at the lodgyng of <hi>Plato</hi> to ſee hym, and demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng him what exerciſe hee had at that tyme: <hi>Plato</hi> aunſwered them thus. Truely my brethern I let you know, that euen now my onely exerciſe was to ſee what the great poet <hi>Homer</hi> ſayd. And this hee told them, beecauſe they tooke hym euen then readyng of ſome of <hi>Homers</hi> bookes, and to ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hys aunſwer was ſuch, as they ſhoold all looke for of hym. For to read a good booke in effect is nothyng els, but to heare a wyſe man ſpeak. And yf this our iudgement and aduiſe ſeeme good vnto you, wee would yet ſay more, that you ſhoold profyt more to read one of theſe bookes, then yow ſhould to heare ſpeak, or to haue conference wyth the autor hym ſelf that made yt. For it is wythout doubt, that all wryters haue more care and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in that their penne dooth wryte, then they haue in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their tongue dooth vtter. And to the end you ſhould not thynk wee can not proue that trew that wee haue ſpoken, I doo you to wytte, that euery autor that wyll wryte, to publyſh hys dooyng in prynt, to lay yt to the ſhew and iudgement of the world, and that deſyreth thereby to acquire honor and fame, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternyſe the memory of hym, turneth many bookes, conferreth wyth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wyſe and learned men, addycteth hym ſelf wholly to hys booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoureth to vnderſtand well, oft refuſeth ſleepe, meat and drynk, quyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kneth hys ſpyrits, dooyng that hee putteth in wrytyng exactly with long aduiſe, and conſideracion: whych hee dooth not, when hee dooth but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak and vtter them, though oft in deede (by reaſon of his great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) in ſpeach vnwares there falleth out of hys mouth, many goodly and wiſe ſentences. And therefore god hath geeuen hym a goodly gift that can read, and hym much more that hath a deſyre to ſtuddy, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng how to chooſe the good bookes from the euill. For to ſay the troth, there is not in this world any ſtate or exercyſe more honorable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytable then the ſtudy of good bookes. And wee are much bound to thoſe that read, more to thoſe that ſtudy, and much more to thoſe that wryte any thing, but moſtly doubtles to thoſe that make &amp; compile goodly bookes, &amp; thoſe of great and hye doctrine. For there are many vayn and fond bookes, that rather deſerue to bee throwen in the fyer, then once to bee read or looked on. For they doo not onely ſhew vs the way to mock the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mean to offend vs, to ſee them occupy their brayns &amp; beſt wyttes they haue
<pb facs="tcp:21411:290"/>
to write fooliſh and vayn thyngs, of no good ſubiect or erudicion. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that is woorſt of al yet, they are occaſion that dyuers others ſpend aſmuch tyme in readyng their ieſts, and mockries, as they woold otherwiſe haue imployed in doctrine, of great profyt and edifying, the which to excuſe and defend their error, ſay they dyd not write them for men to take profyt thereby, but onely to delight and pleaſe the readers, to paſſe the time away meryly. Whom wee may rightly aunſwer thus: that the readyng of yll and vayn bookes can not bee called a paſtime, but aptly a very loſſe of tyme. And therefore <hi>Aulus Gelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> in the fyfteenth of his booke writeth, that after the romayns vnderſtoode the orators and poets of Rome did geeue them ſelues to write, vain, voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and diſhoneſt bookes, cauſing enterludes, and poetical commedies to bee played, they dyd not onely banyſh them from Rome, but alſo out of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parts of Italy. For yt hee ſeemed not the Romayn grauyty, neither was it decent for the weale publyk, to ſuffer ſuch naughty bookes among them, and much leſſe to beare with vitious and laſciuious gouernors. And if the Romain pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyms left vs this for example, how much more ought wee that are chriſtians to continew and follow yt, ſynce they had no other bookes to read ſaue onely hiſtories, and wee now a days haue both hiſtories &amp; holy ſcriptures to read which were graunted vs by the church, to the end by the one wee myght take ſome honeſt pleaſure and recreation, and with the other procure the health of our ſoules. O how farre is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth now a days dygreſſed from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wee write and counſel, ſence wee ſee playnly, that men occupy them ſelues at this preſent, in readyng a number of bookes, the which onely to name I am aſhamed. And therefore ſayd <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> in his forteenth booke, that there was a certayn phyloſopher wrote a booke of hye and eloquent ſtile, but the ſubiect very hard &amp; dyffuſe to vnderſtand, the which <hi>Socrates</hi> and other phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers hearyng of, commaundid immediatly the booke to bee burned, and the author to bee banyſhed, by whych example wee may well perceyue, that in that ſo perfyt and reformed vniuerſyty they woold not onely ſuffer any laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious or vitious booke, but alſo they woold not beare with thoſe, that were to hawty and vayn glorious in their ſtiles, and whoſe matter were not profyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and benefyciall to the publyk weale. That man therefore that walloweth in idlenes lappe, and that vouchſafeth not to ſpend one hower of the day to read a graue ſentence of ſome good booke, wee may rather deſeruedly call hym a brute beaſt, then a reaſonable creature. For euery wiſe man ought to glory more of the knowledge hee hath, then of the aboundaunce of goods hee poſſeſſeth. And it can not bee denied but that thoſe which read vertuous boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, are euer had in better fauor and eſtimacion then others. For they learn to ſpeak, they paſſe the tyme without trouble, they know many pleaſaunt thyngs which they after tel to other, they haue audacyty to reprooue others: &amp; euery man delyteth to heare them, and in what place or company ſo euer they come, they are always reuerenced &amp; honored aboue others: euery man deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their knowledge and acquaintaunce, and are glad to aſk them councel. And that, that is yet of greater credyt to them is, that they are not few in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that truſteth them with their body and goods. And moreouer I ſay, that the wiſe and learned man which profeſſeth ſtudy, ſhall know very well how
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:21411:290"/>
to councel his frend, and to comfort him ſelf at all tymes when neede dooth ſerue, which the foolyſh ignoraunt perſon can not doo, for hee can not onely tell how to comfort the afflycted in aduerſity, but alſo hee can not help hym ſelf in hys own proper affaires, nor take councell of him ſelf what is beſt to doo. But retorning agayn to our purpoſe, wee ſay, beecauſe wee woold not bee reprooued of that wee rebuke others of, wee haue beene very cyrcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and aduiſed, and taken great care and payns in our ſtuddy, that al our bookes and workes wee haue publyſhed and compiled, ſhould bee ſo exactly doone, that the readers might not fynd any ill doctrine, nor alſo any thyng woorthy reproofe. For the vnhoneſt bookes made by laſciuious perſons doo geeue (deſeruedly) euident token to the readers to ſuſpect the autors, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the iudgements of thoſe that geeue attentyue eare vnto them. And the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore I councell, and admoniſh him that will enterpriſe and take vppon him to bee a writer, and ſetter foorth of bookes, that hee bee wiſe in his matter hee ſheweth, and compe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dious in the woords hee writeth: and not to bee ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke to dyuers wryters, whoſe woorks are of ſuch a fraſe and ſtyle, as wee ſhal read many times to the midſt of the booke, ere wee fynd one good and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſentence, ſo that a man may ſay, that all the frute thoſe reap for their pain, watches, and trauayl, is no other, but onely a meere toy and mockry, they beeing derided of euery man that ſeeth their woorks. That autor that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh to write, and afterwards proſtrateth to common iudgement the thing hee wryteth, may bee aſſured that hee ſetteth hys wittes to great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyl and ſtudy, and haſardeth his honor to preſent peryll. For the iudgement of men beeing varyable, and dyuers (as they are in deede) many times they doo meddle and enter into iudgement of thoſe things, whereof they are not onely not capable to vnderſtand, but alſo leſſe ſkylfull to read them. Now in the booke wee haue ſet out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dyal of prynces, &amp; in that other wee haue tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated of the life of the romayn emperors, and in this wee haue now ſet foorth of the fauored courtier, the readers may bee aſſured they ſhal fynd in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and graue ſentences, whereby they may greatly profyt, and they ſhall not read any woords ſuperfluous, to comber or weery them at all. For wee dyd not once licence our penne to dare to write any woord, that was not firſt wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in trew balance, and meat by iuſt meaſure. And God can teſtify wyth vs, that without doubt wee haue had more payn to bee brief in the woords of our bookes wee haue hytherto made, then wee haue had to gather out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention and graue ſentences thereof. For to ſpeak good woords, and to haue good matter and wiſe purpoſes, is the poperty of one that naturally is modeſt, and graue in his actions: but to write breefely, hee muſt haue a deepe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. When at the font of the printers foorme wee firſt baptiſed the booke of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> wee there intituled it the Dyal of princes, and this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that wee haue now made &amp; added to yt, wee will call yt (for more breefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) the fauored courtier: which portendeth the whetſtone and inſtructyon of a courtier. For if they will vouchſafe to read, and take the frutefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells they fynd written herein, they may aſſure them ſelues they ſhall awake out of the vanyties they haue long ſlept in, and ſhall alſo open their eyes, to ſee the better that thyng wherein they lyue ſo long deceyued. And allbeeyt
<pb facs="tcp:21411:291"/>
in deede this preſent woork ſheweth to you but a few contriued lines, yet god him ſelf dooth know, the payns wee haue taken herein hath been exceedyng great, and this for two cauſes: thone for that the matter is very ſtraunge and dyuers from others, thother, to thynk that aſſuredly it ſhould bee hated of thoſe, that want the taſte of good diſcypline. And therefore wee haue taken great care, it ſhould come out of our hands well refoormed, and corrected: to the end that courtiers might fynd out many ſentences in yt profitable for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not one woord to trouble them. Thoſe noble men or gentlemen that wil from hencefoorth haue their children brought vp in princes courts, ſhall fynd in this kooke all things they ſhall neede to prouide them of, thoſe alſo that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue been long courtiers, ſhall fynd all that they ought to doo in court, And ſuch alſo as are the beſt fauored of princes, and cary greateſt reputacion of honor with them, ſhall fynd likewiſe excellent good councells, by meane whereof they may always maynteyn, and continue them ſelues, in the cheefeſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their credit and fauor: ſo that it may wel bee called a mitridatical elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, recuering and healing all malignaunt opilations. Of all the bookes I haue hitherto compyled, I haue dedicated ſome of them to the Imperiall maieſty, &amp; others to thoſe of beſt fauor &amp; credit w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him: where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> readers may ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I rather glory to bee a ſatire, then a flatterer, for that in al my ſentences they can not fynd one cloked woord, to enlarge and imbetter my credit and eſtate. But to the contrary, they may read an infynyt number of others, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re I doo exhort them to gouern their perſons diſcreetly and honorably, and to amend their lyues thencefoorth. Whan I imprinted the Dyal of princes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and brought them to lyght, I wanted not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters and detracters that beeganne foorthwith to teare mee in peeces, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhal I want at this preſent (as I beeleeue) ſuch as will not ſpare wyth venomus tongues to poyſon my woork. But lyke as then I litle wayd their ſclaunderous ſpeaches of mee, euen ſo much leſſe doo I now force what they can ſay againſt mee, beeing aſſured they ſhal fynd in the end, they haue yl ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of mee, and my poore woorks, proceedyng from them rather of a certayn enuy that gnaweth their hart, then of any default they fynd in my doctryne: comforting my ſelf yet in the aſſuraunce I haue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al their ſpight ſhal one day haue an end, and my woorks ſhal euer bee found good and perdurable.</p>

                        <hi>PLutarch, Plinie,</hi> and <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> declare, that kyng <hi>Agiges</hi> one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the oracle of <hi>Appollo</hi> to tell hym, who was the happieſt man in the world, to whom aunſwer was made that it was a man they called <hi>Aglaon,</hi> bee knowen of the gods, and vnknowen of men. This kyng <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giges</hi> makyng then ſearch for this man thorough all Greece, who was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Aglaon,</hi> found at length that it was a poore gardyner dwellyng in <hi>Archa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> who beeing of the age of three ſcore years and twoo, neuer went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a myle from his houſe, keepyng hym ſelf and his famyly contynually wyth hys onely labor and tyllage of hys gardeyn. Now all bee it there we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re in the world of better parentage and lynage then hee, better accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed of ſeruaunts and tenaunts, better prouyded of goods and ryches, hygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in dygnyty, and of greater authoryty then hee: yet for all this, was this <hi>Aglaon</hi> the happyeſt of the world. And thys was, for that hee neuer haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prynces courts, neyther by enuy to bee ouerthrowen, nor yet by aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryce to bee ouercome. For many tymes it chaunceth to men, that when they would leaſt geeue them ſelues to acquayntaunce, then come they moſt to bee knowen, and when they make leaſt account of them ſelues, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth there an occaſyon to make them to bee moſt reputed of. For they wynne more honor, that diſpyſe theſe goods, honors, and ryches of thys world: then thoſe doo, that continually gape, and ſeeke after the ſame.

Yt is a mockry, and woorthely hee deſerueth to bee laughed at, that thynketh contentacion lyeth in hauyng much, or in beeyng of great authoryty: for ſuch ways are redyer to make vs ſtumble, yea and many tymes to fall down ryght, then ſafly to aſſure vs to goe on our way.</p>
                     <p>The punyſhment that God gaue to <hi>Cain</hi> for murderyng of his brother <hi>Abel</hi> was, that his body contynually trembled, and hee euer after wandered tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the world: ſo that hee neuer found ground wheare hee might enhabyt, nor houſe where hee might herber. And albeeit this malediction of <hi>Cain</hi> was the fyrſt that euer god ordeyned, I durſt affirme notwythſtandyng that it remayneth as yet vntyll this preſent day amongſt courtyers, ſyth wee ſee them dayly traueyle and runne into ſtraunge countreis, dayly chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng

                     <p>Hee that forſaketh his own countrey where hee lyued at eaſe, and in heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th, and the place where hee was knowen and beeloued, the neyghbors of whom hee was viſyted, the frends of whom hee was ſerued, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of whom hee was honored, the goods wherewith hee mayntay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him ſelf, hys wife and children (of whom hee had a thouſand plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and conſolations) and that commeth to ſerue and dye in the court: I can not ſay otherwiſe of hym, but that hee is a very foole, or that hee commeth to doe penaunce for ſome notable cryme hee hath commytted. And therefore not wythout great cauſe was thys name of court (whych in our tongue ſygnyfyeth ſhort) adhibited to the pallace of prynces, where all things in deede are ſhort, onely enuy and malice excepted, which contynue long. Hee onely deſireth to bee a courtier, that as yet hath not taſted the ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and pleaſure of his own houſe, nor hath yet prooued and ſeen the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and payns of the court. For hee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knoweth them, ſygheth when hee is called to the court, and weepeth when hee is kept long there. I haue ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed in tymes paſt in the vniuerſities, preached in the court, praying in relygion: and now I dwell vppon my byſhopryck, teachyng and Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng my dyoceſſans: but I dare ſay, of all theſe fower ſtates recyted, there is none ſo ſtreight, and paynfull, as is to follow the court. If I ſtudyed at the vniuerſyty, I dyd yt of free wyll to bee wyſer: but onely in the court I ſpent my tyme, to bee more woorth then I was. But the greateſt tyme I conſumed in religyon, was to ſay my prayers, and to bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle my greeuous ſynnes. In the court I onely gaue my ſelf to ſuſpect my neyghbor, and inuented to buyld great caſtells of wynd (wyth thought) in the ayer. And therefore I retorn once agayn to ſay, that it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trouble to beecome a courtier, then to bee a relygious perſon. For in religion it ſufficeth to obey one: but in the court hee muſt ſerue all. And in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygion alſo they are appareled wyth leſſe coſt and charges, and to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contentacion of the perſon, then they are in the court. For a poore gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman courtyer ys bound to haue more chaunge and ſutes of apparell, then the falcon feathers. The religious perſons goe allways to dynner, and fynd their meat on the table ready prepared for them, wythout any thought taken of their part what they ſhall haue: but fyne courtiers many times riſe out of their bed, without euer a peny in their purſe. And allbeeit relygious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons all their lyfe take great payns in ryſyng at mydnyght to ſerue god: yet
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21411:292"/>
haue they great hope after their death, of the heauenly reſt and comfort: but poore courtyers, alas what ſhould I ſay, hard is their lyfe, and more peryllous their death, into greater daunger truely putteth hee hym ſelf that beecommeth a courtyer, then dyd <hi>Naſica</hi> when hee was wyth the ſerpent, then kyng <hi>Dauid</hi> wyth the <hi>Phyliſtiens,</hi> then the Southſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers wyth <hi>Euah,</hi> then <hi>Hercules</hi> wyth <hi>Antheon,</hi> then <hi>Theſeus</hi> wyth the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notawre,</hi> then kyng <hi>Menelaus</hi> wyth the wylde bore, then <hi>Corebus</hi> wyth the monſter of the maryſh, and then <hi>Perſeus</hi> wyth the monſterous whale of the ſea. For euery one of theſe valyaunt men were not afrayed but of one: but the myſerable courtyer ſtandeth in feare of all. For what is hee in court, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeeyng hys neere kynſman or deereſt frend, more in fauor or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyt then hym ſelf, or rycher then hee, that wyſheth not hys frends death, or at the leaſt procureth by all means hee can, hee ſhall not equal, nor goe euen with him in credyt or reputacyon. One of the woorſt thyngs I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyder and ſee in courtyers is, that they loſe much tyme, and profyt lyttell: For the thyng wherein they ſpend their days, and beeſtow the nyghts for the more part is, to ſpeak yll of thoſe that are their betters, or excell them in vertues: and to vndoo thoſe that are their equalls and compaignyons: to flatter the beeloued, and among the inferior ſort to murmure one agaynſt an other, and allways to lament and ſygh for the tymes paſt.</p>
                     <p>And there is nothyng that prouoketh courtyers more to complayn, then the dayly deſire they haue to ſee ſundry and new alteracions of tyme. For they lyttle way the ruyn of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common weale, ſo they may enlarge and exalt their own eſtates. Alſo it is a thyng of cours in court, that the reiected and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorleſſe couctyers ſhole togethers, murmuryng at their prynces, and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytyng their councellers and offycers, ſaying they vndoo the realme, and bryng all to nought. And all thys preſuppoſed, for that they are not in the lyke fauor and eſtimacion that they bee in, whych beareth offyce and rule in the common weale. And therefore when it commeth in queſtyon for a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer to aduaunce hym ſelf, and to come in credyt in the court, one courtyer can ſcarſly euer truſt an other. On thother ſyde, mee thynketh that the life of the court is not the very lyfe in deede, but rather an open penaunce. And therefore in my oppinion, wee ſhould not recken courtyers alyue, but rather dead, buryed in their lyfe. For then the courtier euer fyndeth him ſelf pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with deaths extream paſſions, when hee perceyueth an other to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and called beefore hym. Alas, what great pyty it is to ſee a hapleſſe and vnfortunat courtier, for hee ſeely ſoule awaketh a thowſand tymes in the nyght, toſſeth from ſyde to ſyde of hys bed, ſometyme vpright hee lyeth, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentyng his Iron happe, now hee ſigheth for his natiue ſoyle, and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth then for hys loſt honor: ſo that in manner hee ſpendeth the whole night in watch and cares, imaginyng wyth him ſelf all ways hee can, to come in credyt and fauor agayn, that he may attain to wealth and prefarment beefore others, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> maketh mee think, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not a pain, but a cruel torment: no ſeruice but tribut: &amp; not once only, but euer: that the body of the poore miſerable cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier abideth and that (in deſpyte of him) his wretched hart dooth beare. By the law of the court, euery courtyer is bound to ſerue the kyng, to accompany
<pb facs="tcp:21411:293"/>
the beeloued of court, to viſit noble men, to wayt vpon thoſe that are at the prynces elbow, to geeue to the vſſhers, to preſent the auditors, to entertaigne the wardens and captayns of the ports, to currey fauor with the herbingers, to flatter the treaſorers, to trauayl and ſpeak for their frends, &amp; to dyſſemble amongſt their enemies. What legges are able to doo all theſe things? what force ſufficient to abide theſe brunts? what hart able to endure them? and more ouer what purſe great ynough to ſupply all theſe deuyſes? I am of opinion there was neuer any ſo foolyſh, nor marchaunt ſo couetous, that hath ſold hym ſelf in any fayre, or corſt him ſelf for any other marchaundiſe, but onely the vnhappy courtier, who goeth to the court to ſell his lyberty, for a lytle wynd and vayn ſmoke of the court. I graunt that a courtier may haue in the court plenty of gold and ſiluer, ſumptuous apparell, fauor, credyt, and auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: yet with all this abundaunce yee can not deny mee, but hee is as poore of lyberty, as rych of ſubſtaunce or credyt. And therefore I dare boldly ſay this woord agayn, that for one time the courtier hath his deſire in court, a thowſand times they will enforce him to accompliſh others deſires, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſe nor lyke him. Surely it commeth of a baſe and vyle mynd, and no leſſe cowardly, for any man lightly to eſteeme his lyberty, and fondly to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace bondage and ſubiection, beeing at others commaundement. And if the courtier woold aunſwer mee to this, that though hee ſerue, yet at leaſt hee ys in his prynces fauor. I woold reply thus, though hee bee in fauor with the prynce, yet is hee notwithſtanding ſlaue to all his other officers. For if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer will ſell his horſe, his moyle, his cloke, his ſweord, or any other ſuch lyke whatſoeuer hee ſhal haue redy money for al, ſauing for his lyberty, which hee lyberally beſtoweth on all for nothing. So that hee ſeemeth to make more eſtimate of his ſweord, or apparell hee ſelleth, then hee dooth of his lyberty which hee geeueth. For a man is not bound to trauail at all, (to make hym ſelf maſter of others) more then pleaſeth him: but to recouer lyberty, or to mayntayn it, hee is bound to dye a thowſand deaths. I ſpeak not theſe things for that I haue read them in my bookes, but beecauſe I haue ſeen them all w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> myne eies: and not by ſcyence, but by experience: and I neuer knew cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer yet content in court, much leſſe enioying any iote of his lyberty, which I ſo much eſteeme, that if al men were ſufficient to know it, and knew wel how to vſe it, hee woold neuer for any treaſure on earth forgoe yt, neyther for any gage lend yt, were it neuer ſo precious. Yet is there in court beeſides this an other kynd of trouble I haue not yet touched, and that is not ſmall. For oft tymes thyther commeth of our frends which bee ſtraungers, whom of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyty, and for honeſties ſake, the courtier muſt lodge with him at home, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court beeing all ready full peſtered. And this happeneth oft in ſuch a tyme, when the poore courtier hath neither lodging of his own, to lodge them in: nor hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely ſyxe pence in his purſe to welcome them with all. I woold you woold tel mee allſo, what grief and ſorrow the poore courtier feeleth at his hart, when hee lodgeth in a blynd narrow lane, eateth at a borowed table, ſleepeth in a hiered bedde, his chamber hauing no doore to it, yea and forthe more part his apparell and armor, euen to the very ſweord in gage. Then when any frend of his commeth out of the countrey to lye with him hee beeing ſo poore, and alſo a ſtraunger in another mans houſe: how is it poſſible hee ſhoold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21411:293"/>
into his company any others, and perhaps as nedie as hee? Sometimes hee were better, &amp; had rather beare his frends coſts, and charges (beeing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnable) yea and fynd him al his neceſſaries (what ſhift ſo euer hee made) then hee ſhould ſuffer his frend or ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to come home to his howſe to knowe and ſee the myſery hee liueth in. For more is the honeſt hart and good nature aſhamed and greeued to diſcouer his myſery, then yt is to ſuffer and abyde yt. Comonly the courtier beeing alone is conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with a litle couch, one mattreſſe or quilt, one flockbed, with one pillow, and one payr of ſheets, with one couerlet, with one frieng panne, one gridyerne, one ſpitt, one kettel one baſen, with one candelſtick, and with one pott, which hee can not doo, if any ſtraunger or frend of his come to him, for then hee muſt for his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion ſake hang his chamber, dreſſe vp his bed, and furniſh yt better, and muſt alſo prouide for a thouſand other ſuch trifles hee ſtandeth in neede of. And if it fall out his hoſt and goodman of the howſe wil not lend him theſe things, or that perhaps hee hath them not (as it chaunceth oft) hee ſhalbee compelled to borow vpon a gage, or to hier of others: whereas if hee were alone with his owne people, hee would right wel bee contented with his ſmall ordinary. And whan a ſtraunger cometh to ſeee him, hee muſt bee at greater coſt and charges: ſo that hee ſhall ſpend more at one dyner, or ſupper, then hee had doone beefore in three daies. And therfor dowtles the courtiers are at more charges with their frends y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> come to ſee them, then thei are with them ſelues. For the honorable and woorthy courtiers had rather faſt an other tyme, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſhewe him ſelf at this pinch needy and hard, and to bee mocked of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. O, howe many men are there in the world that ſpend in one daye al that they haue traueled to get togethers in manie? not for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they eſteme not their goods, &amp; deſire not to keepe then: but onely for a litle vayne glorie, to get the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of a free harted &amp; liberall man, dealing honeſtly among his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. Alſo as grete is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> troble to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore courtier when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court remoueth oft from place to place. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee muſt truſſe vp his bagage, lode y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moyls, &amp; hier carts to cary yt, afterwards pray the cofferer to pay him, the harbingers to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him a lodging, and then hee muſt fyrſt ſend one of his men to ſee if the lodging bee meete for him: furthermore courtiers haue occaſion oftymes to bee angrie with the carters and muletters, for loding to much or to little, and for coming too late to the lodging, &amp; many times alſo they muſt tide at noone days, and in the greatiſt heate and ſomtymes in raine, dewe, tempeſt, or in other ill weather (what ſo euer yt bee) for that the carters and cariers will not loſe their iorny. And admit that all this may bee eaſely caried, is it therfore reaſonable, or meete, the poore courtier ſhould ſpend at one vyage or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the court, all the profit &amp; ſpare hee hath made in ſir moneths beefore? And what ſhal wee ſay alſo, of the ſtuffe and moueables that the poore courtier of neceſſitie muſt buy in euery place where the court remaineth, as chaiers, tables, formes, ſtools, water potts, platters, diſſhes, and other ſmall traſſhery that would coſt more the cariage, then the buyng of them a newe. and to conclude, al things pertaining to court are paynfull, vnpleaſaunt, and chargeable for the poore courtier. For if hee ſhould cary alwayes with him, al ſuch things as bee neceſſary, and that hee ſhould neede: in cariage they are broken or mard, or beeing left beehind, they are in haſard to bee ſtollen or loſt.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:294"/>
For hee that will bee a continuall courtier, muſt bee of a bold and ſtowt cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. For hee ſhalbeee forced howerly to leaue of his owne deſiers, to pleaſe and content others, chaunging and ſhifting to diuerſe places and ſtraunge lodgings, and ofttymes, of ſeruants and newe family, daily increaſing his charge and expence. And truly if that which is gotten and gayned in court bee worth much: much more dooth that exceede that is ſpent in court, and theſe expences are rather lauiſhe, then moderat: diſordered, then well ſpent, for in effect courtiers ſpend more, with ſtrangers they receiue into their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, then they doo with their ordinary ſeruants they keepe. Albeeit that, that courtiers loſe and leaue beehind them at euery remouing of the court bee but of ſmal accompt or importance, yet is it notwithſtanding both greefe, and diſpleaſure to them. For in dede there is no howſe ſo richly furniſhed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with moueables, but that the lord or maſter of the howſe will chaſe to ſee a diſſhe or glaſſe broken, or ſpoyled. Yet there is an other diſcomodity in remouing of the court, for ſome courtiers there are that bee ſo poore, that for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t they canne hardli follow the court, and others alſo that are rych, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to beare many of their charges with whome they are in company with by the way: and ſome of thoſe are ſo rude, &amp; ill brought vp, that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beare their charge al their iourny, then once againe to haue them in their company. But a godsname what ſhall wee ſay yet of the wretched cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier whoſe coffers, and horſe are arreſted at his departing for his debts? Truly I ly not, for once I ſawe a courtiers moyle ſold for her prouinder ſhee had ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, &amp; that mony not ſufficient to pay the hoſt: the courtier remaining yet det<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an ouerplus, the poore man was ſtripped euen of his cappe and gloues for ſatiſfaction of the reſt. Alſo there is an other ſorte of needy courtiers, ſo trobleſome, and importune, that they neuer ceaſe to troble their freends, to borow money of their acquayntance, ſoome to fynd themſelues, ſoome to apparell them ſelues, others to pay their dets, others to play, and others to geeue preſents ſo that at the remouing day, when they haue nothing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pay nor content their crediters, then are they ſued in lawe, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in theyr lodging, and the credyters many tymes are not ſatiſfyed with theyr goods, but take execution alſo of theyr bodyes, laying them in faſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, till they bee payd and ſatiſfied of their whole dett. O what a folly may bee thought in thoſe, that cannot moderat theyr expences according to theyr ability? For to ſay vprightly, hee ſhould cut his garments according to his cloth, and meaſure his expences with his reuenues, and not followyng his affection and deſire. For the gentleman, or courtier, in the end hath not the meane nor commodity to ſpend as the contry man hath, that lyueth at home at eaſe in his contry, &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth ſuch commodityes as hee brings into his howſe, but the courtier conſumeth in court not his owne alone, but alſo that of others. And therfore in courte or els where, let euery wiſe man bee diligent to bring his affaires to end: but yet let him ſo moderate and vſe his expences, as hee ſhall not neede, nor bee driuen to morgage and gage that hee hath. For hee that feaſteth, and rowteth with others purſe of that that is lent hym, cannot chooſe but in the end hee muſt breake, and deceyue his crediters. Therfore all woorthy men that loue their honor, and feare reproche, ought rather to ſuffer honger, cold, thirſt,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21411:294"/>
care, paine and ſorow: then to bee had in the check rowle, of riotous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall ſpenders, truſtles of their promiſe, and ſuſpected of their woords. There is yet an other great troble in the court of princes, and that is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding derth of vittels, the vnreſonable wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of howſes, and the great price of horſes, for many times they ſpend more for ſtraw, and litter for their horſe, then they doo in other places for hey, otes, and bread. And further if the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier bee a poore gentillman, and that hee would feaſt and bancket his frends or companions, hee ſhall ſpend at one dinner or ſupper ſomuch that hee ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee conſtrained to faſt a hole weeke after. Therfore if the courtier wilbe wel vſed in folowing of the court, hee muſt not only know, and ſpeake too, but alſo loue, and inuite at tymes the bouchers, vittlers, fruterers, keepers, and ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Fiſhmongers, and poulterers, and other purueiers of the ſame, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e hee ſhall alwaies haue aſmuch neede of his prouiſion, as hee ſhall haue of the iudges, to ſhew him Iuſtice when hee ſhal neede it. For meate, bread, wyne, wood hey, otes, &amp; ſtraw, are como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly very deare in court: For fewe of al theſe things are to bee bought in court, but of others infinit things to bee ſold, to profit and gaine the poore courtiers, that els had no ſhyft to liue. And yet is there a litle more trouble in court, and that is, that continually letters are ſent to the courtier from his frends, to obtaine of the prince or his counſel his diſpatch in his priuate affaires, or for his ſeruants or tenants, or other his frends. And manie times theſe ſutes are ſo ill welcome to the courtier, that hee had rather haue pleaſured his frend with a peece of mony, then they ſhould haue layd vpon him ſo waighty a matter. And beeſides this there is yet an other troble, that the bringet of the letter muſt needes ly at the courtiers houſe attending his diſpatch, ſo that the courtier delaiyng his frends buſines, augmenteth his greefe, and keeping the meſſenger there, increaſeth his charge. And if perchanſe his buſines bee not diſpatched, and the ſute obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thoſe that wrote to him will not think hee left it of, for that bee would not doo it or take paines therin: but for that hee wanted fauour and credit, or at leaſt were very negligent in following their cauſe. And that that vexeth them thorowly yet is, that their parents and frends weene (which are in the contry farr from court) that this courtier hath all the courtiers at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, that hee may ſay, and doo what hee wil there. And therfore his frends, when they haue occaſion to imploie him in court, and that they wryte to him touching their affaires, and that hee hath now taken vpon him the charge and burden of the ſame, ſeeing him ſelfe after vnable to diſcharge that hee hath enterpriſed, and can not as hee would ſatiſfie his frends expectaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: then hee faleth to diſpaire, and wiſſheth hee had been dead when hee firſt tooke vpon him this matter, and that hee made them beeleeue hee could go thorough with that they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to him, beeing vnpoſſible for him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſmall credit and eſtimation amongſt the nobility and councellers.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I would neuer councell him that hath brethern, frends, or other neere kynſfolks in court, to go ſeeke them out there, albeeyt they had mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great weight and importance, on hope to bee diſpatched the ſooner by their credite, fauour, and ſute: and for this cauſe, for that in court there is euer more priuy malice, and Enuy then in other places: wherefore they can not bee reuenged one of the other, but muſt tary a tyme, and then when
<pb facs="tcp:21411:295"/>
they ſee oportunity, they ſet in foote to ouerthrow, and ſecretly to put back their enemyes ſute. Now lo, theſe things, and other infinite plagues doo light on theſe poore vnfortunate courtiers, incredible happely to any but the old and experienced courtier. Yf the old and wiſe courtier would count all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors and miſchances, the derth and aboundance, the frendſhips and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the contentation and diſpleaſures, &amp; the honor &amp; infamy hee hath endured in the court, I beeleeue aſſuredly wee ſhould not bee a litle ſory for that body that had ſuffryd ſomuch, but much more for that hart that had abidden al thoſe ſtormes and broyls. Whan the courtier ſeeth that hee is not hard of the prince, nor ſpoken to of the beloued &amp; fauored of the court, and that the treſorer dooth not diſpatch him, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coferer keepe back his wages, it is a miſery to ſee him, &amp; on the other ſyde a pleaſure and paſtime to heere what hee ſayes, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the wretched life of this world. And euen then in his heat and rage hee teareth and blaſphemeth god, and ſweares accurſedly, that thenceforth hee will forſake the vaine abuſes of court, and leaue alſo the trompries of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deceitful world, auowing to encloſe him ſelfe in precinct of religious wales, &amp; to take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him alſo religious habit. Alas if I fetched as mani ſighes for my ſinnes, as courtiers doo for their miſhaps and diſgraces: what a nomber would they come to? For a courtier, incontynent that hee feeleth him ſelfe ſicke, that hee is alone, and reiected of his freends in court, hee beeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſo heauy and penſiue, that with his deepe ſighs hee priceth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens on hye: and with his flowing teares hee moyſteth the earth beelowe: So that a man might more eaſely nomber the trobles of the ſtowt and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Hercules,</hi> then thoſe which the courtier dayly ſuffereth. And beeſides thoſe many wee haue recited, yet further, theſe alſo wee can recite, that theire ſeruants robbe them, their purſeberers conſume their mony, ieſters and counterfet knaues ly euer vpon their reward, woomen pick their purſes, and ſtrompets and bawds ſpoyle them of all. But what ſhall I ſay more to you. If the poore courtier bee full of feathers, euery man plumes him: but if hee want whings, there is no man haſty to plume him: and to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, in princes court you ſhall find no ſuch trade of life, wherby you may ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy euery man. For if the courtier ſpeake litel, they will ſay hee is but a foole, &amp; if hee bee to large of tong, they will ſay hee is a glorious foole, if hee bee free in expences, they wyll ſay hee is a prodigall foole, yf hee bee ſcarſe of his purſe, they will ſay hee is a couetous miſer, yf hee bee alone, and ſolitary at home, they will account him an hypocrite: and if hee viſite others oft, they will ſay hee is a bold and trobleſome man, if hee haue any trayne of men following on him, they will ſay hee is a prowde man: and if hee go without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pany, that hee is poore, and miſerable. So that of court, this may rightly bee ſayd. That it is a very theather, wheare one mocketh and grinneth at an other, and yet in the end they (al in maner) fynd them ſelues ſcorned and deceiued. Nowe diſcurſing alſo of ſleepe, doth the courtier alweys ſleepe aſmuch as hee wil? no ſuer, but aſmuch as hee may. And touching his meate, hath hee alwayes that hee lyketh? no truly: but hee is forced to bee contented with that hee hath. And as for his apparel, is hee clothed according to his wiſe no no: but according to others fanſies. O vnhappy courtier, that ſpendith the moſt parte of his myſerable life, in coming his head, waſhing his beard, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

faire and braue hoſe, varniſhing his ſword &amp; dagger, blacking his bootes, prouiding him of clokes, bying him cappes, furring him gownes, and ſitting him ſelf with other ſmall &amp; needefull trifles: waſting in them all his owne goods, and that of his frends. I am not of that mynd &amp; opinion that others are, that ſay there are none in ſo greate liberty as courtiers bee, which ſhould not bee ſayd, &amp; much leſſe credited, ſith wee ſee by dayly proofe: if they bee in ſeruice, they are as ſclaues. If they bee not in ſeruyce with the kyng, or other nobleman, they lyue in poore eſtate. Nowe let euery man ſay what hee will: wheare pouerty reigneth, there liberty can haue no place.

Now goe to the court that liſt, procure office &amp; auctority that wil: for hither to I neuer met or ſpake with man that was contentid with the court. For if hee bee crept in fauor hee feareth euery hower to fall, and loſe his credit, if euer hee bee once out of fauor, &amp; in diſgraſe, hee diſpayreth hee ſhall neuer returne againe into fauor, and if hee that goeth to the ſea committeth him ſelfe firſt to god beefore hee take ſhyppe: much more ought hee to doo yt that goeth to dwel in court: For in the ſea, of a C, ſhippes there doo not periſh te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne: but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, of a .1000. courtiers, there cometh not three in fauor.</p>

                     <head>¶Of courtiers brawles and quarells with the harbingers for ill lodging. Cap. ii.</head>
                     <p>AFter <hi>Lucullus</hi> the roman his retorne from <hi>Aſia,</hi> in an oration hee made beefore the ſenat, hee ſayd thus: I ſweare vnto you by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Imortal gods (fathers conſcript) that in all this my iorney I felt no payne, nor troble, nether for the conduct and gouernment of myne army, nor for the rebellion of the people, nor for the abſence of my freends, nor for the warr of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies, nether for the long tyme, nor yet for the perill of my life. For all theſe things are incident to ſoldiors and men of warr, and comon to rulers in peace. But if you bee deſirous to know what was my troble, and that that greeued mee moſt, yt was on the remembrance of the quiet reſt I had at home. For as you know right wel (ſacred ſenat) during y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time a man lodgeth in other mens howſes hee is neuer at liberty. And this woord of <hi>Lucullus</hi> mee thinketh euery courtier might well apply to him ſelfe, for that hee is alwayes bound to doo ſeruice to the maſter of the howſe wheare hee lodgeth, yea although hee receyue a 1000. iniuries of him, yet therfore it is not lawfull for him to anger or diſpleaſe him in any thing. Therefor in very il and vnluckye hower is the courtier arriued, when hee muſt take his iourney in ſteade of reſt, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile for quietnes, myſery for aboundance, bondage for liberty, and payne for pleaſor, and albeeit courtiers abide many paines and trobles, yet this mee thinketh is the greatiſt, and leſt tollerable, when they muſt bee lodged: reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the paines, diſpleaſures, fortunes, and miſhappes that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuffer, litell is that my penne dooth write heerin, and much leſſe that my tong doth ſpeake
<pb facs="tcp:21411:296"/>
in compariſon of that the wofull hart dooth byde. O how many things are there, that are felt euen as the very bottome of the hart, and yet dare not the tonge once vtter them? Truly how poore a howſe ſo euer the courtier hath in the contry, hee ſhould more eſteeme yt, then the beſt lodging that euer hee met with in court, or els wheare. For at home, hee dooth and comaundeth all that hee wil: But in an other mans howſe, hee muſt take that is geeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. A pilgrime or traueler ſhal come into a citty, wheare hee ſhal ſee fayre &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly churches; ſtately buyldinges, rich gates, high walles, pauid ſtreates, large market places, prouiſion enough, aboundaunce of vittells, and nombers of ſtrangers, and when hee hath ſeene all this, hee dooth ſo litle eſteeme of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that to retorne agayne to his poore home, hee trauelleth though it bee all the night. And therfor wee ſhould not wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der at thoſe, that doo not greatly ſtray from their howſe, and that are but ſeldome in many places: but wee might well haue him in ſuſpition, that continually wandreth through ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and howſes. For notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the great wonders hee ſeeth, and the greate conuerſation of amity that hee hath or can fynde, yet in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end they are only the eies that are fed with the ſight of others thinges, &amp; not the hart that is contented with his owne, and alſo to ſee in princes courts great treaſure &amp; ritches brings vs comonly more greefe then delight. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more his eye is fed with viewe of the faire dames of court &amp; princely pomp therof, the greater ſorrow aſſaulteth his harte, hee may not ſtill enioy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. And therfor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed <hi>Focion,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Athenian captain, aunſwered once certaine men y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſaid there were to bee ſolde in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> markett place of Athens goodly ſtones, &amp; rich Ieweles woorthi y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſight, howbeeit hard to bee bought, beeing held at ſo hie a price by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marchant that ſold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. From my firſt youth (ſayd this philoſopher) I made an oth: neuer to goe ſee any city, onles it were to conquer yt, &amp; yeld yt ſubiect to mee: nor to go ſee Iewels, that I could not buy. The great emperor <hi>Traian</hi> was much comended, for that hee neuer tooke toy in his head to go ſee any thing, but for one of theſe three cauſes, to weete: ether to imitate that hee ſawe, to bye yt, or els clerely to conquer yt. O worthy words of <hi>Focion,</hi> and <hi>Traian,</hi> &amp; very meete to bee noted &amp; retained. Now to ſpeake more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the trobles daily heaped on their necks that folow court, &amp; that are to bee lodged in dyuers places, and ſtraunge howſes, I ſay: that if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier doo depart at night from the court to repaire to his lodging, hee fyndeth oft tymes the hoſt of his howſe, and other his gueſtes at home, alreadie in theire beds, and faſt aſleepe: ſo that it hapneth ſomtimes, hee is fayne to go ſeeke his bed in an other place for that night. And alſo if hee ſhould riſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the morning to followe his matters, or to wayte vpon his lord our maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his hoſt perhaps and his howſehold are not yet awake, nor ſlurring to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him the doore. And further if his hoſt bee angry &amp; diſpleaſed, &amp; out of time: who ſhall let him to lock his doores, the day once ſhutt in? and who ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell him to open his doores beefore brode day? Truly it is a great happ to bee wel lodged aboute the courte, &amp; much more to meete with an honeſt hoſt. For it hapneth oft, that the great pleaſure and contentacion wee receiue, bee<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing lodged in a faier lodging is lightly taken from vs, by the hard intreatie and ſtraight vſage of the hoſt of the ſame, And in this is apparant, the vanity, fondnes, and lightnes of ſome courtiers, that rather deſier, &amp; ſeeke for a fayre
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21411:296"/>
&amp; pleaſant lodging: then for a good, and profitable. The ambition of the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier is now growne to ſo great a ſoly, that hee deſireth rather a fayr lodging for his pleaſure, then a comodious or profitable for his family. For admit the harbinger doo geeue them a good and comodious lodging, if yt bee not ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the eye, &amp; ſtand comodiouſly, they can not lyke of yt by no meanes. So that to content them, the fouriers muſt needs prouide them of a faire lodging to the eye, though litel handſome to lodge in: and yet ſomtymes they wil hard &amp; ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bee pleaſed with that. And if the courtier bee of reputacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and beeloued in court, I pray you what paine and troble ſhall the poore harbinger haue to content his mynd, and to continew in his fauor? For beefor maſter cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier wilbee reſolued which of the .ii. lodgings hee will take, the fayre and moſt honorable, or the meane &amp; moſt profitable, hee bleedeth at the noſe for anger, and his hart beats and leapes a thowſand tymes in his body. For his perſon would haue the good, and comodious lodging: &amp; his folly, the pleaſant, &amp; fayr. I neuer ſawe dead man complaine of his graue, nor courtier content with his lodging. For if they geeue him a hall, hee will ſay it wanteth a chimny, if they geeue him a chamber, hee will ſay yt lacketh an inner chamber, if they geeue him a kitchin, hee wil ſay it is to lowe, &amp; ſmoky, and that yt wanteth a larder, if they geeue him a ſtable, that it wanteth a ſpence or ſtorehowſe, if they geeue him the beſt: &amp; cheefeſt partes of the howſe, yet hee ſaieth he wanteth ſmall &amp; litell houſes of office, &amp; if hee haue acceſſe to the wel, hee muſt alſo haue the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of the baſe court. And in fyne, if they geeue him a low paued hall, to coole &amp; refreſhe him in ſommer, hee wil alſo haue a high boorded chamber for the winter, &amp; poſſible hee ſhall not haue ſo many roomes at home in his owne howſe, as hee will demaund in his lodging abrode. And therfor many things ſuffereth the courtier in his owne howſe, that hee wil not beare with al in an inne or an other mans howſe. And it may bee alſo, that the harbingers haue prouided them of a fayr &amp; goodly lodging, wheare hee ſhall comaund, both maſter, Stuff, and al other things in the howſe, &amp; yet the courtier ſhal miſlike of it, fynding faulte it is to farre from the courte, &amp; reputeth yt halfe a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor &amp; impayr of his credit to bee lodged ſo farre of, ſynce others that are bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, &amp; in fauor in court in deede, lye hard adioining to the court, or at the leaſt not farr of. For this is an old ſayd troth, the neereſt lodged to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt eſteemed of the prince. I haue ſeen many courtiers offer large giftes, &amp; rewardes, to intreat the harbingers to lodge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court: but I neuer ſaw any that deſyred to bee lodged neere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche, &amp; this cometh, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glory to bee right courtiers, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good chriſtians. And therfore <hi>Blondus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth in his booke <hi>De declinatione imperii</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a gretian called <hi>Narſetes,</hi> (a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great) was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſay oft, that hee neuer reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred hee we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea, nor e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pallace, nor beega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any battaile, nor cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>celed of warres nor mounted a horſe back, but that firſt hee went to the church &amp; ſeruid god. And therfor by the dooings &amp; ſaiyngs of <hi>Narſetes</hi> wee may gather that euery good man ought rather to incline to bee a good chriſtien, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to geeue him ſelf to armes and chiualry to bee a right courtier. It happeneth many times, that after the courtier bee come to his lodging, hee lyketh of yt well, and is well pleaſed with all: but when hee hath been in others lodgins, &amp; hath looked v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, ſtraight way hee falleth out of liking of his owne, and thinketh him ſelfe il lodged to others. And this miſliking groweth not of his ill lodging, but
<pb facs="tcp:21411:297"/>
of an inward mallice &amp; ſpite hee hath, to ſee his enemy preferred to a better then his own. For ſuch is the ſecret hate, &amp; enuy, in princes court, (a thing co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon to courtiers) that they diſdaine not only to thanke the harbingers for their care take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, in placing them in good lodgings: but they muſt alſo complaine, and ſpeake ill of them, for the good lodgings they haue geeuen to their aduerſaries, and compaignions, better then that of theirs. There is alſo a fowle diſorder in court among the harbingers, in appointing lodgings: and litell modeſty beeſides in courtiers in aſking them. For ſuch there are, that many times, nether they, nor their parents haue any ſuch lodgings at home in their own howſes, as they will demaund only for their horſkeepers, &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. But the great payne of the court is yet, that ſuch nouels as come new<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly to court, they ſay they are of great eſtimation in the contry, rich, and of an auncient howſe, and his father of great autority and eſtimation, and when the troth is knowen, his fathers autority and firſt eſtimation was, of good la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers, &amp; huſbandmen, their only rents and reuenues conſiſting in that thei gat, by the daily ſwet &amp; labour of their perſons: and their power and ability, in the rents of an other mans goods: and their liberty, in ſeruice &amp; ſubiection of thoſe that gaue them wages, and hyred them by the day. And I would to god their bloud were not tainted with ſome other notable blot. There is a plague alſo in the court, which alwayes dureeth, and neuer leaueth court, and that is: that thoſe that are alwayes leaſt woorth, and of leaſt calling, doo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume &amp; take vpon them moſt, &amp; alſo are woorſt to pleaſe of al others. And this they doo (their power beeing ſmall) that they would ſupply that in woords &amp; countenance, which they want in deedes and effects. I ly, if I ſaw not once in the county of <hi>Aragone,</hi> a gentilma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that hyred a whole howſe, wheare him ſelfe and his famely were very well lodged and comodiouſly: &amp; after that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred I met with him in <hi>Caſtilla,</hi> wheare hee could not content him ſelfe with the change of eight howſes, beeſides his firſt hee was appointed to: and the occaſion was, for that in <hi>Aragon</hi> hee paied for that howſe hee had, and for theſe hee paied nothing. So of others purſe euery man coueteth to ſhowe his magnificence, and to declare his follyes: but when they deffray their owne charge, they are hard as flynt, and goe as neere to woorke as may bee. It is very true, that if there bee any diſorder &amp; troble to bee lodged in the court, it cometh alſo for the moſt parte of the harbingers, without whome the courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers could neuer bee well lodged, although the prince had commaunded they ſhould bee lodged, neere him. Albeeit in the court a man may eaſiy exempte him ſelf from the princes councel, &amp; iuſtice of the ſame, hauing no ſutes there, and from the councell and affaires of warres beeing no captaine: From the ſinode of the ſpiritualty, beeing no eccleſiaſtical perſone: and from that of the Indians, going to no Magicians: from the conuention of marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, keeping ſafely their marchandiſe: &amp; from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the lord high marſhal of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, not beeing fooliſh &amp; inſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: yet neuertheles there is no courtier (bee hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo high or great in fauor) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can auoyde him ſelfe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harbingers auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but hee muſt needes come vnder his lee, beeing in their power to diſpoſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lodgis as they think good: to lodge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> honorably or meanly, to pleaſe or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to lodge or diſlodge them. And if the courtier happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at any tyme to quarel or fal out w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him hee ſhalbee reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harbingers in his lodging, and poſſibly a horſkeeper, (yea perhapps his enemy) ſhalbe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21411:297"/>
better lodged then hee, or els hee may ſeeke his lodging in the ſtreats where hee ſhal. For all other iniuryes or offences doon in court, whatſoeuer, the courtier may eaſely redreſſe them by Iuſtice, but for thoſe hee receyueth of the harbinger, hee muſt take them quietly, and bee contented with them. For otherwiſe wee ſhould not onely offend them, but iniure our ſelues, and make them to prouyde vs of no lodging: ſo heerby wee ſhould vtterly bee diſlodged, and vnprouided. And therfore they doo beare with many things in that office, which they would not doo in any other office: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Thoſe kynd of officers muſt bee much made of, of others well intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, accompanied, feaſted, flattered, followed, yea and many tymes ſerued and waited vpon. I meane in ſeruing their turne, anoynting their hands, and alwayes inritching their gloues with ſome peece of gold and ſiluer, and alas, the ſeely courtier that hath not ſuch ſoueraigne oyntment in his box, to cure theſe aboue recited ſores, but only to ſerue his owne turne: if hee bee not his kynſeman, or neere allied, let him yet at leaſt get acquaynted with him, &amp; make him his frend, an eſye thing to bring to paſſe, if hee doo not vex him nor geeue him thwart language, &amp; ſomtymes hee muſt inuite him to dinner &amp; ſupper. For in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court there is no goodnes gotten, neyther by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beloued, by the noble men, by the honorable of his councel, treaſorers, nor yet by the harbingers, but in ſuffering them, &amp; dooing them always good &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſeruice. And if percaſe the harbingers wrong you, &amp; doo you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, or that they ſhould ſay you were trobleſome and importunat: yet bee you wyfe to beare with them in any caſe, and ſeeme not to heere them. For what loſeth the courtier, if hee bare now and then with a fewe crooked woords at the harbingers hands? mary by forbearing them, hee haply cometh to bee lodged the better. Suppoſe the courtier bee not alwayes lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to his mind and deſire, ſhould hee imediatly complayne of them or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at them? no ſuer, hee ſhould but ſo dooing ſhewe him ſelfe of ſmall edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. For what ſkylleth yt though among many pounds of good meate, the boucher ſometyme myngle a morſell of lyuer, longes, or lightes of the beaſt. And therfore a man ſhould not blame the poore harbingers ſomuch as they dooth. For they are not commaunded of the king to buyld new lodgings, but ſuch as they are, to deuide them amongſt the trayne of his court: So that they lodge courtiers in ſuch as they find, &amp; not in thoſe they would, adding therto y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue regard to their eſtates &amp; demerits, &amp; not to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affections &amp; willes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſons they lodge.

There are in the court ſuch hare braines, and vndiſcreete perſons, that haue ſo litell regard and reſpect to their honeſt hoſtes, that they doo nothing in their lodgings, but reuell and keepe il rule, and doo euen what they liſt, as though the houſe were theirs to commaund, and not gyuen them only for lodging. Whereof ſprings two exceeding euils, the one that they offend god: and the other that the prince is alſo ill ſerued. For the howſe is not geeuen them to commaund, but onely appointed for them to lodge in.

Now if among the <hi>Daces</hi> no officer or iuſtice could lay hold or puniſh any man, ſo long as hee kept his howſe: mee thinketh it is againſt all reaſon, and humanity, that the courtier ſhould once offer his hoſt an iniurious or vnſeemely word. <hi>Plato</hi> beeing one day reproued of his frends, for that hee would not rebuke his hoſt <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Siracuſan,</hi> who at the firſt receiued him very courteouſly, and afterwards vſed him ill, anſwered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus. My frends, to bee angry with fooles that ſhew vs pleaſure, to take reuenge of children whom wee haue brought vp, to beate a woman with whome wee muſt bee familiar, and to braue and braule with thoſe in whoſe howſes wee are lodged, nether the philoſophers of Greece ought to councell him, nor the noble hart once to think to doo yt. I can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that there are ſome hoſtes very rude and vnciuil, that it is in maner an impoſſible thing to bring him to any honeſty or ciuility. Howbeeit not<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>withſtanding I would wiſh the noble and worthy courtier to take in ieſt, all the wronges and iniuries doone or ſayd to him by his hoſt, or at the leaſt to ſeeme as though hee hard them not all: otherwiſe, from that day the courtier falleth out with him, hee may euen withall thinke preſently to depart his howſe, and to ſeeke him a new lodging: for hee can neuer bee quiet in his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, where the goodman of the howſe and hee cannot agree. And where ſo
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21411:298"/>
euer the fyne courtier ſhall lodge, let him neuer ſtick at the charges of a lock to his chamber doore a hatch to the window, a degree or .ii. to the ſtaires, a rope for the well, a harth to the chimny, nor for a caſement to the wyndowe, for theſe are but trifles, &amp; they coſt lytle, though hee leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the howſe: yet with thoſe trifles hee byndeth his hoſt, &amp; makes him beeholding to him. Alſo hee may not forget ſometime to ſend home cates to his hoſt, and to inuite him to dinner to him: and lykewiſe if his hoſt did preſent him with any thing, hee muſt accept it in very good part, and thank him much for yt. For other while, by ſmall preſents, great frendſhipp is obteyned. The diſcreete cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier muſt alſo forbid his pages and ſeruants to come into his hoſtes gardeyn, to ſpoyle his frute, or to gather his flowers, to ſteale his hennes, or to breake any thing of his: That they pul not vp the pauements of the howſe, paynt his walles with coles or chalke, that they robbe not his done howſe, nor make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noyſe to ſteale his coneys, to breake his glaſſe windows, and to hurt or marr any thing about his howſe: For if many times they refuſe to lodge ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in their howſes, it is, not for want of lodging, or that the maſters ſhould comber them: but for the diſpleſures, and ſhrewd turnes they receyue by their pages and ſeruants daily. Yt ſhall chaunce many tymes that a cittezin that hath a faire newe howſe, goodly whyt walles, and trimly paynted, ſhall haue a courtier come to lodge in his howſe, that ſhall haue ſuch a trayne with him of ſeruants, yong children and their neuews, which are ſo fooliſh, proud and ſo rechles, that they breake the formes, throw downe tables, paint &amp; beedawb y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles, beate down doores, ronne thorough the feelings, ſteale the byrds, and doo a thouſand other miſchefes &amp; vnhappy turnes, ſo that the poore owner of the howſe had rather lodge an other tyme Egiptians &amp; beggers: then ſuch rude &amp; harmefull courtiers. And therfore I haue ſeene in the court, by reſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſeruants diſorder &amp; ill rule, the maſters comonly ill lodged, lodgings denied them, or after they had them to bee quite taken from them. One of the neceſſarieſt things a courtier ſhould haue, is to keepe quiet &amp; well conditioned ſeruants: otherwiſe it is to bee thought (as in deede the comon ſaying is) the howſe to bee ill gouerned, where the family &amp; ſeruants are ſo ill conditioned &amp; diſordered. And touching this matter <hi>Aulus Gellius De noctibus atticis</hi> ſaieth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when <hi>Cornelius Gracchus</hi> was retorned to Rome, after hee had been co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſul a great while in the Iles <hi>Baleares,</hi> hee ſaid theſe woords beefore all the ſenate. You know (fathers conſcript) I haue been chief Iuſtice, &amp; conſull, xiii. yeares. during all which tyme I ſweare to you by the imortal gods, that to my know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge I neuer did wrong to any man, nether any ſeruant of myne diſpleaſure to any, nor doone any thing that was not lawfull to bee doone in the howſe where I lay. <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tyraunt when hee receyued any diſpleaſure of the <hi>Agrigentines,</hi> hee cauſed his ſeruants to lodge in their howſes with them, for the one and the other were ſo wicked, ſo vnthrifty, ſuch quarellers, and brawlers, that hee could not worke them a greater ſpyght nor diſpleaſure, then to lodge theim heere and there in theyr howſes. There bee alſo in the court ſome courtiers, that are eſteemed of euery man to bee of ſo euill bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour and demeanor, their ſeruantes and famyly of ſuch lewde and nawghty condicyons, that theyr hoſtes are throughly reſoluyd, ether not to receyue them into theyr howſes, or if they bee compelled to yt, to abſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:299"/>
ſelues for the tyme of their beeing there: rather then to ſuffer ſuch iniuryes and wrongs, as they are ſuer they muſt take at their hands. The courtier muſt conſider that ſomtimes hee hath neede of a bottel of water to drink, a broome to ſwepe his chamber, a platter or diſh to ſerue him withal, of a table cloth and napkins, and of a towell for his hands and his face, of a ſtoole to ſit on and of ſoome kettle for the kytchin: and in ſuch caſe, hee ſhould charge his ſeruaunts curteouſly to aſke theſe things of his hoſt, and not to take them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force &amp; vnaſked. Euery man deſiereth to bee maſter in his owne howſe, and bee hee brother, couſen, or frend, hee will not ſuffer him to beare aſmuch rule in his own houſe, as him ſelfe. So that hee wilbe leſſe offended, with the hurt and loſſe of thoſe things that hee hath lent, and were gently aſked him: then with thoſe, which vnknowing to him, by force, and againſt his will they haue taken from him, yea though they bring them afterwards hole and ſound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And this our libertie is ſomuch ſet by, that wee ſhall ſee ſometimes a man for his pleaſure, playe and loſe a.c. Crownes of gold, and ſaye neuer a woord: and on the other ſyde, if one breke the leaſt glaſſe in his howſe, hee will crye, and rage to the heauens. I remember whan I was a courtier, and went to viſit an other courtier a frend of myne, that was ſick in his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, I fell a chiding and rebuking the hoſt, for that I found him exclaymyng and criyng out of the pages, which plaiyng at the bal had broken him a lytle lampe of glaſſe, and hee aunſwered mee thus. I cry not (ſyr) for the loſſe of my lamp which is a halfpeny matter, nor for the oyle that they ſpylt worth a farthing, but onely for the liberty they robbe mee of, and for the ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they make of mee. The good and wiſe courtier may not bee to familiar with his hoſt his wief, nor ſuffer his ſeruants to bee buſy with the mayds of the howſe, more then to ſpeake to them for their neceſſaries, for in this caſe, they ſhould leſſe hurt the maſter of the howſe, to ranſake and ſpoyle his houſe, and all that hee had in yt: then to take from him his honor and good name. To caſt the bedds on the flower, to break the doores &amp; windows, to vnpaue the ſtones, to paint and black the walles, or to make any noyſe in the howſe, are all of them things: yet ſomtimes tollerable though not honeſt nor ciuill: but to take his wief, and to abuſe her, it is nether lawfull nor poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſſemble yt, much leſſe to ſuffer it. For it were too much ſhame, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch to the huſband to abide yt, and high treaſon and crime abhominable for the courtier to doo yt. Nowe ſynce men are frayle, and that they can not, nor wil not ſubdue their paſſions and filthy motions of the fleſh, there wanteth not notwithſtanding women in princes courts, whoſe loue &amp; frendſhips they may eaſely embrace: which though they were al commaunded to auoide the court, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vierge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, yet it could not bee choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but ſome might ſecretly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue ſtil in court to enterteine the courtly courtiers. For if in the court there bee kept a table of plaie .ii. moneths onely in the yeare, all the yeare long bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they fynd the ſtreats full ſtored of comon woomen. when the yeare is moſt plentiful and frutefull of all things, yet ſtill there lacketh ſoome prouiſion of vittailes in the court: but of ſuch women there is neuer no want but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to manie. And therfore wee haue not ſayd without great reaſon, that it were to much treaſon and diſhoneſty for the courtier to fall in loue with his hoſteſſe: for in dooing yt, hee ſhould doo her huſband too much wrong, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21411:299"/>
the wife, and offend his frends and neighbors, and vtterly vndoo hym ſelf. For <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> reſyteth that <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> cauſed a Captayn of his to bee beeheaded only for ſclaundering and defaming of his hoſteſſe, the which hee did not, tarying for the complaint of her huſband, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> accuſation of any other. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor <hi>Aurelianus</hi> ſeeing one of his men at a window one day pulling his hoſteſſe by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſleeue, cauſed his hand to bee ſtriken of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, although both his hoſteſſe and hee ſware hee did it but in ieſt, and to no other intent. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in hys booke <hi>De matrimonio</hi> ſayth, that there was a law among the <hi>Licaoniens,</hi> that if any ſtraunger did but only talk with his hoſteſſe, his tong ſhoold bee cut out of his head, and if hee had paſſed further, that hee ſhoold then loſe his head. <hi>Macrobius</hi> alſo in hys <hi>Saturnaller</hi> reciteth, that amongſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romayns it was reputed a great infamy, if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> came, and prayſed the beawty and maners of the miſtreſſe of the houſe where hee lodged, for in praiſing her, hee let them vnderſtand hee knew her, and knowing her hee ſpake to her, and ſpeaking to her, hee opened his hart to her, and this dooing, hee playnly defamed her, and made her to bee euel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of. <hi>Aulus Gelius</hi> wryteth that the lyke puniſhment was geeuen to him that had carnall participacion with any veſtall virgin, the ſelf ſame was alſo executed on him that procured any infamy to his hoſteſſe where hee lay.</p>
                     <p>Which puniſhment was, either to bee cutt in the middes, &amp; quartered in fower parts, or els to bee ſtoned to death alyue. The good courtier muſt alſo haue an other great regard, &amp; that is, to comaund his ſeruants to looke wel to his ryding apparell, and ſuch as are lent him of courtiers to wear otherwhile, to ſee that it bee kept clean and well bruſſhed, and aboue all ſafely delyuered where it was borowed, For commonly the horſkeepers haue theyr horſes lowſing clothes and their maiſters footecloth more nete and clenly, then the groomes and pages of the chamber haue his apparell: and this proceedes of their great ſlouth &amp; neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And truely this paſſeth the bounds of ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt degree, yea and commeth much to charge the courtiers conſcience, the ſmall account hee hath, ſo to let his garments and apparell, and other hys mouables to bee ſpoiled and loſt. And this happeneth very oft by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of their pages and ſeruaunts, which now throweth them about the chambers, dragges them vpon the grownd, now ſweeps the houſe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, now they are full of duſt, then tattered and torne in peeces, here their hoſe ſeam rent, there their ſhooes broken: ſo that if a poore man come afterwards to buy them to ſell agayn, it will rather pity thoſe that ſee them, then geeue them any corage to buy them. Wherefore the courtier ought not to bee ſo careles, but rather to think vppon his own things and to haue an eye vnto them: For if hee goe once a day to his ſtable to ſee his horſes how they are kept and looked to, hee may lykewiſe take an other day in the weeke when hee may fynd leiſure to ſee his wardroppe, how his apparell lyeth. But what paciens muſt a poore man take, that lendeth his implements and apparell to the courtiers? that neuer laieth them abroad a ſunning, to beat out the duſt of them, nor neuer layth them in water, to waſh and white them, bee they neuer ſo fowl. And al bee it the beds and other implements lent to the courtier, bee not of any great value, yet it is not fitt they ſhoold bee thrown at theyr tayl &amp; kept filthyly: For as charely and dayntily dooth a poore laboring and huſband
<pb facs="tcp:21411:300"/>
man keepe his wollen couerlet, and ſetteth as much by it, as dooth the iolly courtier by his quilt or couerpane of ſilk. And it chaunceth oft tymes alſo, that though at a neede the poore mans bed coſteth him leſſe money, then the rich mans bed coſteth him, yet dooth it ſerue him better, then the ritch and coſtly bedd ſerueth the gentleman or nobleman. And this to bee true, wee ſee it by experience, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore huſbandman or citizen ſlepeth commonly more quietly, &amp; at his eaſe, in his poor bed &amp; cabean w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſheets of tow: then dooth the lord or ritch courtier, lying in his hanged chamber, &amp; bed of ſilk, wrapped in his fyneſt holland ſhetes, who ſtill ſigheth &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playneth. And fynally wee conclude, that then when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court remoueth, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courtier departeth from his lodging where hee lay, hee muſt with all curteſy thank the good man and good wife of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe for his good lodging, &amp; curteous intertainment hee hath had of them, &amp; muſt not ſtick alſo to geeue them ſomwhat for a remembrance of him, and beeſides, geeue certein rewards among the maides &amp; men ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of the houſe according to their ability, that hee may recompence them for that is paſt, &amp; win their fauor for that is to come.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>DIodorus Siculus</hi> ſaith, that the honor and reuerence the Egiptians vſed ordinarily to their Princes was ſo great, that they ſeemed rather to woorſhip them, then to ſerue them; for they coold neuer ſpeak to them, but they muſt firſt haue lycence geeuen them. When it happened any ſubiect of <hi>Egipt</hi> to haue a ſute to their prince, or to put vp a ſupplication to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to them they ſayd theſe woords. Soueraigne lord &amp; mighty prince, yf it may ſtand with your highnes fauor &amp; pleaſure, I wil boldly ſpeak: yf not, I will preſume no further, but hold my peace. And the ſelf reuerence &amp; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome had towards god <hi>Moyſes, Aaron, Thobias, Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and other fathers of <hi>Egipt,</hi> making like interceſſion when they ſpake wyth god, ſaying. <hi>Domine mi rex, Si inueni gratiam in oculis tuis, loquar ad dominum meum.</hi> O my lord and king, yf I haue found fauor in thy ſight, I wil ſpeak vnto thee: yf not, I will keepe perpetuall ſylence. For there is no ſeruyce yll, when yt is gratefull &amp; acceptable to him, to whom it is doon: as to the contrary none good, when it pleaſeth not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> party that is ſerued. For if hee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſerueth, bee not in his maiſters fauor hee ſerueth, hee may well take pains to his vndooyng, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out further hope of his good will or recompence. Wherefore touching that I haue ſayd, I inferre, that hee that goeth to dwell &amp; abyde in the court, muſt aboue all indeuer him ſelf all hee can to obtayn the princes fauor, and obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, hee muſt ſtudy to keepe him in his fauor. For it ſhoold lyttle preuaile the courtier to bee beeloued of all others, and of the prince only to bee miſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. And therefore <hi>Alcamidas</hi> the Grecian, beeing once aduertiſed by a frend of his, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> did greatly thirſt for his death, &amp; the <hi>Thebans</hi> deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his life: hee anſwered him thus. If thoſe of <hi>Athens</hi> thirſt for my death, &amp; them of <hi>Thebes</hi> likewiſe deſyring my life, I can but bee ſory &amp; lament. How bee it yet, if King <hi>Phillip</hi> my ſoueraigne lord &amp; maiſter hold mee ſtill in hys grace &amp; fauor, &amp; repute mee for one of his beeloued, I care not if all <hi>Greece</hi> hate and dyſloue mee, yea and lye in wayt for mee.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:300"/>In deede it is a great thing to get into the princes fauor, but when hee hath gotten it, doubtles it is a harder matter to know how to keepe it. For to make them loue vs, and to winne their fauor, wee muſt doo a thouſand ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſeruyces: but to cauſe them to hate and diſlyke of vs, the leaſt dyſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the world ſuffyſeth. And therefore the pain and trouble of hym that is in fauor in the court is great, if hee once offend, or bee in diſpleaſure.</p>
                     <p>For albeeit the prince doo pardon him hys fault, yet hee neuer after retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth into his fauor agayn. So that to conclude, hee that once only incurreth his indignation, hee may make iuſt reckening neuer after, or maruelous hardly to bee receiued agayn into fauor. Therefore ſayth the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his bookes <hi>De republica:</hi> that to bee a king and to raigne, to ſerue and to bee in fauor, to fyght and to ouercome, are three impoſſible things, which nei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther by mans knowledge, nor by any diligence can bee obtayned: only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the hands and diſpoſing of fickle fortune, whych dooth diuyde and geeue them where it pleaſeth her, and to whome ſhee fauoreth beſt.</p>
                     <p>And truely <hi>Plato</hi> had reaſon in his ſaying, for to ſerue, and to bee beeloued, is rather happ and good fortune, then induſtry or diligence. Since wee ſee oft times that in the court of princes, thoſe that haue ſerued but three yeres only, ſhalbee ſooner preferred and aduaunced, then ſuch one as hath ſerued perhaps .xx. or .xxx. yeres, or poſſible al his life tyme. And further hee ſhalbee both diſplaced, and put out of ſeruice, by means of thother. And this proceeds not through his long and faithfull ſeruyce hee hath doone, but only by reaſon of the good hap that foloweth him. Although <hi>Plato</hi> telleth, that to gett real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and ſeignories, to ouercome battels, and to bee fauored and beeloued of princes, bee things graunted to vs rather by haſard, &amp; fortune, then by force, of good woorks, and laudable acts, or by long toylyng in painfull ſeruice: yet the noble and ſtout hart therefore ſhoold not ceſſe at any tyme to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and manfully to execute in euery occaſion preſented to him, to achyue to fame and honor: neither for any payn and labor to loſe the hope to obteyn his pretenſed purpoſe. For men ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>etymes loſe many things, rather through timorouſnes, and want of audacitie, then for that they lack good hap or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. To ſee in the court of princes ſome to bee richer, more honored, more noble, more eſteemed, better beeloued, more wayted vppon, better ſerued, &amp; better welcome then others, and more feared then others: wee may by theſe tokens know, that fortune hath not vſed to reward thoſe with ſuch fauors &amp; preferrements, which lyue at home ydlely, and much leſſe courtiers, who liue in court with all pleaſure and delicacy, wherewith they are neuer weryed.</p>
                     <p>Let no man bee ſo fond to think, that fortune is ſo bountifull and liberall, that for his autoritie, or only thought, ſhee wilbee once moued to lift him out of miſery, to exalt him to higher place and dignity, without ſome ſecret and priuate reſpect had to his vertue. For when ſhee many tymes vppon a ſodein raiſeth any to high and great eſtate, it commeth by the merits of him that is exalted, or through the diſpleaſure of him that is throwen down: in whoſe rome ſhee hath placed an other in fauor with her. As wee read of <hi>Iulius E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius,</hi> for a tyme hygh in fauor, and afterwards in great diſgrace wyth the emperor <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> in whoſe place and rome ſucceeded afterwards an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther named <hi>Alexander,</hi> who beeing one day reproued by ſome of his frends
<pb facs="tcp:21411:301"/>
of ingratitude towards them, (that ſaid they were cauſers and furderers of his honor and preferrement) aunſwered them in this maner. Maiſters, if I am comen into ſuch fauor with themperor, my good and gracious lord, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the place of <hi>Emilius,</hi> truely it was more by reaſon of his deſerued fall, then by your obtayned means or requeſts: Fortune and his heauy deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hauing ſo willed and ordained it, more to ouerthrow and diſplace hym of his roome and credit hee was in, then to aduaunce and preferre mee to the ſame. The which I ſay, to aduyſe the citizen &amp; gentleman that goeth to the court to bee a courtier, to thend hee bee not fickle headed, &amp; light of beelief, to think that immediately hee ſhal come to ſuch aucthority, that hee may eaſely comaund al that hee will: neither that hee ſhoold ſo much diſpair, &amp; bee hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, but that by tyme (in ſeruing well) hee might come to bee in as great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor, as any other about the prince. Wee ſee dayly ſuch chaunge &amp; alterations in the common weal, &amp; fortune to turne her vnſtable wheele ſo oft, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> adminiſtration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comon weal is in his hands &amp; rule, of whom beefore they made little or none accompt. And therefore I ſay to you, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn returne to tell you, that the courtier y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſeeketh to come into his princes fauor, &amp; to bee beeloued of him, &amp; that coueteth to bee wel reputed of in court muſt indeuor him ſelf to bee very honeſt, &amp; as neere as may bee fautles of lyfe: &amp; true &amp; faithful in his charge or office hee taketh vpon him. For the good oppinion that men haue of a man, is euer the firſt degree to attain to the princes fauor. For there is no man in the world, of whatſoeuer ſtate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion hee bee, ſo vicious and laſciuious, but at the leaſt hee deſireth to haue an honeſt and vertuous man in his houſe: ſo that a man may ſay, that the good and godly lyfe is the redyeſt mean and way (where euer the perſon bee) to bring him ſooneſt into the princes fauor, and to make him to bee beeloued ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerally. Wherefore <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tyraunt, wryting to an emulator of his, ſayd theſe woords vnto him. I confeſſe thou art an honeſt man, but thow wilt not deny mee alſo, that al thoſe thou keepeſt in thy houſe, bee wicked perſons and of yll lyfe: a thing which in my houſe thou ſhalt fynd all contrary. For although I am a tyraunt, at leaſt yet I loue, that no yll diſpoſed perſon eat bread in my houſe: So that though I am laden with many vyces, yet am I accompanyed alſo wyth many wyſe and learned men. The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> came from <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Scicilia,</hi> only to ſee <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the <hi>Siracuſan,</hi> and not <hi>Plato</hi> him ſelf alone, but alſo dyuers other philoſophers in company wyth him: whom hee did not only honor &amp; intreat well, but alſo ſaw they wanted nothing fitt or neceſſary for them. Many tymes <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> was wont to ſay theſe woords.

By theſe two examples wee may gather, that the tyrants beeing frends to vertuous &amp; honeſt men, much more &amp; of neceſſity ought the good &amp; iuſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to bee. Alſo the courtier muſt take great heede hee bee not arrogant, &amp; a lyer, a flatterer, &amp; diſſembler: for thoſe, &amp; ſuch like faults, are rather woodz &amp;

by pathes, vttlerly to loſe a man: then a playne hie way to bring him into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor and credit. And although by chaunce there haue been ſome, that with all theſe faults haue notwithſtanding crept into fauor: yet wee will ſhow them a hundred, that only for thoſe vices haue been caſt out of fauor &amp; credit both. For comonly, all thoſe that by the fauor of wicked princes beeginne to bee great, and of ſome honor, and that ſtudy by al diſhoneſt &amp; vnlawfull meanes to continew and keepe them ſelues in credit, &amp;: fauor Albeeit for a tyme wee ſee them reigne and floriſh in proſperity: yet that laſteth not long, nether is it perpetuall, but a tyme cometh agayne, when wee ſee them fall, &amp; quite caſt of, to their great ſhame and vtter vndooing. There are many that knoweth and vnderſtandeth the princes court but meanly, or not at all, which beeleue, that for beeing well ſpoken, and beeing carefull and diligent in their buyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and affayres, they ſhould the ſoner for that come in fauor and credit bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others: but in the end their hope and imagination is nothing, not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any thinge their deſier: for as there are in court many greene heads, and graceles couertures, which are of no reputacion, nor any thing ſett by, nether deſeruing to bee wel thought of: So are there many wiſe heads and beeloued courtiers greatly eſteemed and reputed of. And this for their own good demerits, and by meanes alſo of the others wicked abuſe and diſorder. <hi>Suetonius tranquillus</hi> reciteth, that <hi>Scilla</hi> the conſull, beeing mortall enemy of the <hi>Marians,</hi> (of which faction was alſo <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi>) ſayde: that from <hi>Ceſars</hi> infancy his wiſdome made him more to bee feared and wondered at: then euer his ſtoute and valiaunt corage hee ſhowed. <hi>Plutarke</hi> writing to <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſayd. I aſſure thee (Soueraigne prince) I doo more eſteeme &amp; honor thy parſon, then I doo care for al thy empire beeſyds. For I haue ſeen thee doo a thouſand good things to deſerue yt, but I neuer ſaw thee once deſirous to haue yt. And ſuer in my opinion I think there is no better alchemye in court, to grow to ſodeyne wealth, and to acquire the princes fauor: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the ſame of his good life ſhould rather reſound his prayſe to the prince, therby to make him knowen vnto him: then the reſpect of his noble houſe or progenye.</p>
                     <p>That courtier alſo that craueth his princes grace, muſt take heede in any wiſe hee bee not conſorte or companion with raſhe &amp; haſty perſones, whoſe vnſtable heads miſlike of euery ſtate, ſtill deprauing all others vertues.</p>
                     <p>Such felow mates, and compagnions, the wiſe courtier muſt in any caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to bee conuerſant with. I muſt aduiſe him alſo hee beeware hee bee not raſh of ſpeche, nor that hee ſpeake ill of any man: For it is a right kynd of treſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to detrect and backbyte our frends, and much more the prince, to whom wee wholly owe our duty and allegeance. And therfor the wyſe and vertuous courtier muſt fly from this company as farre as hee can, that are poſſeſſed with ſuch vaine humors, and paſſions of mynde: For ſuch kynde of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wil ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer councell vs to ſarue well, nor to beeware of liberal ſpeaking, but will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infect vs, and bring vs to their naughty vaine humor, and make vs to bee demed as bad as them ſelues (though wee bee not ſo) only for keeping them company. Like as in comon weales there are ſeditious heads, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> moue and ſtirre the poore comons to rebellion: euen ſo in princes courtes there are the like factious heads, that ſeeke to wynne good wil of courtiers, &amp; ſo to ſtirr vp their mynds alſo to tumult &amp; ſedition: which, beecauſe they haue no way
<pb facs="tcp:21411:302"/>
to come vp, and grow in fauor, doo detract and ſpeake ill of thoſe, that are in fauor and autority. One of theſe abiects, &amp; inferior ſorte, ſhall go to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> howſe of an other, (in like diſgrace and diſcredit that him ſelfe is in,) and there theſe companions ſhall open theire throtes againſt the prince, and his court ſaiyng, the king careth not for his ſubiects, talking of the high minds and countenances of the beeloued and fauored of court, of the affections of the counſell, of the parciality and enmyty of the court, of the want of munition for warres, and of the fall and decay of the comon wealth: and thus with theys lewde and vncomly diſcorſes, they ſpend the long and dolefull nights of wynter ſeaſon, and ther withall alſo the long and whot ſunny days of ſommers tyme. <hi>Adrian</hi> the emperor beeing once informed, that there met and aſſembled togethers daily, at the houſe of one <hi>Lucius Turbon,</hi> a nomber of the ſeditious and factious ſort of Rome, which were offended with him, and conſpired againſt him: to preuent them of inſurrection, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed preſently through Rome and enacted yt for a law, that all courtiers that aſſembled there, ſhould loſe their heads, and al the Romaines ſhould bee baniſhed. All this wee haue ſpoken, to baniſh vice from princes courts if yt may bee: for now a dayes, as there are many houſes of ordinary ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and nombers of diſyng houſes for all maner of play: ſo is there alſo in the court, beeſides the groome porters, other chambers where they meete to murmure at ech mans dooings. And as there are ſome that ſay, gowe let vs go to ſuch a mans houſe, and there wee ſhall fynd play enowgh, and good fellowſhipp to paſſe the tyme away as wee will: euen ſo theſe others ſay, gow, wee will go to ſuch a chamber, and there wee ſhall meete with our compaignions and good fellowes, wheare wee may talke liberally and at our pleaſure, without check or controll of any. Infamous bee that houſe, wheare there is no other exercyſe, but play and ryot: and accurſed bee that, wheare they can not occupy them ſelues, but in defamyng and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting theyr breethern and neighbors. For to conclude, it were leſſe euel to play and loſe theyr mony, then to robb and ſpoyle his neyghbor of his good name. Now to get into the princes fauor, it helpeth much to conſider, wherin the prince takethe cheefe delyght, and wherto hee is beſt affected: whether to muſick, hunting, fliyng, riding of horſes, or fiſhing, running, or leaping, or any other actiuity what ſo euer it bee. And his affect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier once knowen, and obſerued: hee muſt geeue him ſelfe wholy to loue that the prince loueth, and to follow that that hee followeth. And as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces comonly are geeuen to theyr willes, to leeke ſoome paſtymes better then others: ſo doo they ſhew them ſelues more fauorable and gratious to ſoome of their ſeruants, then others: and rather to thoſe whome only they ſee conforme and agreeable with their affections, then to ſuch as are alwey moſt dilygent and paynefull about them, to doo them the beſt ſeruice they can. The curious courtier may account him ſelfe happy, if hee can frame him ſelfe to comend that the prince alloweth, and lykewyſe to diſſalow of that the prince miſlyketh: and though perhappes hee were many tymes of the contrary opinyon, hee may well thinke and beeleeue to him ſelfe what hee lyketh beſt, but in no caſe to vtter that hee thinketh, nor to make
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:21411:302"/>
any countenance to the contrary. The emperor <hi>Aurelius</hi> neuer dranke other then redd wyne, and beecauſe hee was infourmed that <hi>Torquatus</hi> the Roman, for his ſake dyd not onely refrayne from drinkyng white wyne, but did alſo plant all his vynes with red grapes, hee made him cenſor of Rome, and gaue him the warde of the gate <hi>Salaria</hi> in the ſayd city. In eating and drinking, in hunting, and tilting, in peace, and in warre, in youthfull ſportes, and graue matters, the wiſe courtier muſt alweyes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſteppes and will of the prince, and imitate him in the ſame the beſt hee can. And if yt bee beneficiall for the courtier to haue the princes fauor and to bee eſteemed of him: let him in no wiſe enterpriſe to talke too much to him. For by continuall frequenting the prince yt can not otherwiſe fall out, but hee ſhall both troble him, and bee thought a proud, arrogant, and an importunat foole of him. And if the courtier hath no graue and weyghty matters to moue the prince in, to what purpoſe dooth hee ſeeme to moleſt and importune the kyng? Wee ſay in weighty matters to communicate with him. For to talke with the prince, and to troble his eares with tryfles and matters of ſmall moment, hee ſhould bee reputed of the hearers a raſh man, and of the king him ſelf a witleſſe foole. Let vs conſider a little what is fit for the courtier to doo, and what beecometh him beſt, and whether it bee lawfull for him to conferr with the prince, and then wee ſhall come to know, if yt bee decent for him to ſpeake oft to the prince. Therfor to go to the kynge to ſpeake ill of any man, I think no wiſe man will offer to doo yt: and if it bee to geeue him ſecret intelligence of any thing, hee muſt firſt dout whether the kynge will beeleeue him or no: and to think to counſell him, it is a token of a light head: and to preſume to ſleyt with the prince, and to bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery with him, to paſſe the tyme away, let euery man beeware hee runne not into that error, nor that hee once preaſe to doo it. To ſend to reproue a prince, I know not what hee is that would bee ſo fooliſh hardy once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o dare to open his lippes againſt him: and to flatter him, if the prince bee wiſe, hee will vnderſtand him: and if hee fynd him once, it is enough to turne the flatterer to greate diſpleaſure, yea and to put him quite out of fauor wiſh him. And therfor to liue in ſuerty and auoyde theſe dangers, mee thinkes it is beſt to ſpeake but ſeldome to him. <hi>Lucullus</hi> was a great frend to <hi>Seneca</hi> and was alſo gouerner of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and demaunding one day of <hi>Seneca</hi> what hee might doo that might bee acceptable to the emperor <hi>Nero</hi> his lord and maſter, <hi>Seneca</hi> anſwered him thus. If thou deſier to bee acceptable to princes, doo them many ſeruices, and geeue them fewe words. And ſo like wiſe the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſayd in his bookes <hi>De repub.</hi> that thoſe that haue to moue the prince in any thing, in any caſe bee brief: for in dilating to much, they ſhould both comber the prince, and make him alſo not geeue attentiue eare, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could hee haue leyſure to heare them, nor pacyens to tary them. And hee ſayd further. Thoſe matters and ſubiectes they treate with princes in, and that are vſed to bee told them, ought to bee graue, and ſententi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: eyther tendyng to comodyty of the weale publyke, to his honor or profit, or to the ſeruyce of the kyng, to whome hee ſpeakes. Theiſe counſells and aduertyſements of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> (in my poore
<pb facs="tcp:21411:303"/>
opinion) deſerue to bee noted and had in memory: And notwithſtanding all that I haue ſpoken, I ſay yet further to you, that there is nothing diſpoſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince better to loue and fauor his ſeruants, then to ſee them diligent in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and ſlow in ſpeaking. For to reward him that only ſeekes it by meanes of his tongue and by words, it is in our free wills to doo it: but to recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce him that by his diligent ſeruice only craueth a good turne and not in woords, wee are in conſciens bounde to yt: And hereof ſpringeth the vulgare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe: The good ſeruice is demaund ſufficient, though the tongue bee ſilent.</p>

                     <head>¶What maners and geſtures beecome the courtier when hee ſpeaketh to the prince. Cap. v.</head>
                     <p>WHen the courtier determineth to ſpeake to the prince, hee muſt fyrſt ſhowe him ſelf vnto him with greate reuerence, beefore hee come at him, &amp; if the kyng bee ſet, hee muſt knele to him vpon one knee, with his cappe in his left hand, holding yet nether to farre nor to neere his body, but rather downwards towards his knee, with a good grace and comly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, not to luſtely, nor to much boldly, but with a ſett ſhamefaſt grauity, put<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting him ſelfe on the left hand of the prince to ſpeake with him, whether hee bee ſitting or ſtanding. For placing our ſelues on the left hand, wee leaue the king on the right, as duty willeth vs: For the right hand beelongeth euer to the beſt perſon. <hi>Plutarke</hi> ſayeth, that in the bankets the kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> made, they ſate him, whome they loued, and made moſt account of, cheeke by cheeke, and on the left hand of the prince, where the hart lieth: ſaieng, that thoſe whome they loued with their hart, ſhould bee ſett downe alſo on that ſyde the hart lay, and in no other place. <hi>Blondus</hi> ſayeth to the contrary, that the <hi>Romaines</hi> dyd honor the right hand ſomuch, that when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperor entred ted into the ſenate, no man durſt euer put him ſelfe on his right hand. And hee ſaieth more ouer, that if a yong man were perchanſe found ſitting on the right hand of an old man, or the ſeruant on the vpper hand of his maſter, the ſonne on the right hand of his father, or any page, prentiſe or ſeruing man, on the vpper hand of a burgeis or cyteſin: they were no leſſe puniſhed by Iuſtice for that fault and offence, then if they had doon any notable cryme or delicte. Who ſo euer will ſpeake to the prince, muſt ſpeake with a ſoft voyce and not to haſtely. For if hee ſpeake to loud, thoſe that ſtand by ſhall heare what hee ſayth to the kynge: and in ſpeaking to faſt, the king ſhall not eaſely vnderſtand what hee ſayeth. And hee muſt alſoere hee ſpeake to the prince premeditate long beefore what hee will ſay to him, and put into him good woords and aptly placed: for wiſe men are more carefull what words theyr tongues ſhould vtter, then what theyr hands ſhould doo. There is greate difference beetwixt ſpeaking well, and dooing well: for in the ende the hand can but ſtrike and offend: but the tongue can both offend and defame. Euen when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courtier is telling his tale to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, let him bee aduiſed in all his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; geſtures, &amp; that hee play not with his cappe from one hand to an other, much leſſe that hee beehold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince to earneſtly in the face. For in the one hee
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:21411:303"/>
ſhoold bee taken for a foole, and eſteemed in the other for a ſimple courtier. Hee muſt take great heede alſo that hee ſpitt not, coffe, nor hawk, when hee ſpeakes to him, and if it bee ſo hee bee conſtrayned by nature to it: then let him hold down his head, or at leaſt turn at one ſyde that hee breath not in the kings face. <hi>Plinie</hi> wryting to <hi>Fabatus</hi> ſaith, that the kings of <hi>India</hi> neuer ſuffered any man (in ſpeaking to them) to approch ſo neere them, that their breth might come to their face. And they had reaſon to doo it, to auoid ſtrong and vnſauery breths, growing rather of the indiſpoſition of the ſtomak, or of the putrefaction of the lungs, or of the corruption of the brayn. And if the courtier haue to ſpeak with the king after dinner or ſupper, let him beeware hee eat no garlyke, nor onyons, nor drink wine without water. For if hee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of garlyk or onyons, the king may think hee lacketh diſcretion to come wyth thoſe ſents to his preſence: or if his breath were ſtrong of wyne, that hee were a drunkard. Hee muſt bee very circumſpect alſo that when hee ſpeaketh to the king, hee ſpeak not with his head, aſwell as wyth hys tongue, nor that hee play not wyth his hands, nor his feete, nor y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee ſtroke hys beard, nor wynk with his eyes: for ſuch fond countenaunces, and geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, doo rather beecome a foole or ieſter, then a ciuill or honeſt courtier.</p>
                     <p>And in his diſcourſe with the Prince, that hee exceede not in ſuperfluous woords, more then ſhall onely bee needefull and touching his matter, and not to ſeeme in his preſence to depraue or detract any man. Hee may honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allege, (and that without reproch) the ſeruyce hee hath doon him: but not to lay beefore him others faults and imperfections. For at ſuch a tyme it is not lawfull for him to ſpeak yll of any man, but onely to communicate wyth hym of his own affayrs. And hee may not goe ſo farre alſo, as to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber him with too great affection, the blood ſpent by his aunceſtors in hys ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyce, nor the great acts of his parents: for this onely woord ſayd to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, I did this, better pleaſeth and lyketh the Prince, then to tell him a hundred other woords of that that hys predeceſſors had doone. It pertayneth onely to women, and they may iuſtly craue recompence of the prince for the lyues of their huſbands loſt in the princes warres: but the valyaunt, and woorthy courtier, ought not to demaund recompence, but for that hee only hath doon, by perſyng launce, and bloody ſwoord. Hee muſt beeware alſo that hee ſhew no countenaunce to the king of inſatiſfaccion, neither to bee paſſioned in caſting his ſeruice in the princes teeth, ſaying all others haue been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced ſaue only him, whom the Prince hath clean forgotten. For princes will not that wee only ſerue them, but that wee alſo (at their willes and pleaſures) tary for recompence, and not to haue it when wee gape, or are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune for yt. Howbeeit it is lawfull notwithſtandyng, humbly and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wythout cholor or paſſion, to put the Prince in remembraunce of all that wee haue doone for him, and of the long tyme wee haue ſpent in ſeruyng him. Alſo the curious courtier ſhall not ſhew him ſelf to dyſlike at all of the prince, neither by heaping of many woords, to induce him to bere hym the better good will. For mens harts are ſo prone to yll, that for one only vnpleaſaunt or ouerthwart woord ſpoken to them, they lyghtly forgeat a thowſand ſeruyces doone them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:304"/>
                        <hi>Socrates</hi> beeing one day demanded what hee thought of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes of Greece, aunſwered. There is no other difference beetwene the names and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the gods, and that of princes, but that the Gods were immortall, and theſe mortall. For theſe mortall princes vſe in maner the lyke aucthority here in earth, that the gods immortall doo in heauen aboue. Saying further alſo, that I alwayes was, am, and wilbee of that mynd, that my mother Greece re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn a common weal. But ſince it is determined to bee gouerned by prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly monarchie, I wiſh them in all, and for all, to acknowledge their obedyence and allegeance to their king and ſoueraigne. For when they woold otherwiſe vſe it, they may bee aſſured they ſhall not only goe againſt mortall princes, but alſo againſt the eternall god. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> ſayeth, that <hi>Titus</hi> the emperor being aduertiſed that the conſuls woold kill him, and vſurp his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, aunſwered thus wiſely. Euen as without the diuine will and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I coold neuer haue poſſeſſed the imperiall crown, ſo without their permiſſion and ſufferaunce, it lyeth in no mans power to depriue mee of it.</p>
                     <p>For to vs men it pertaineth only to keepe the imperiall iuriſdiccion, and to the gods alone to geeue and defend it: Which wee haue ſpoken, to thend no man preſume to bee reuenged of his prince, neither in woord nor deede: for to ſpeak yll of hym, wee ſhoold rather purchaſe vs their high indignation and diſpleaſure, then procure vs any cauſe or ſuggeſtion to bee reuenged of him. Let the good courtier bee alſo aduyſed, that in talking with the prince hee bee not to obſtinate, to contend with the prince, or any other in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces preſence: For this name of arrogant, and ſelf willed, beecommeth not the perſon of a wiſe courtier. For wee know that in ſport, and argument euery man deſireth to ouercome, how tryfling ſo euer the matter bee.</p>
                     <p>And therefore wee read in the lyfe of the emperor <hi>Seuerus,</hi> that <hi>Publius</hi> the conſull ieſted one day with <hi>Fabritius</hi> his compagnion, and told him hee was in loue. Whom <hi>Fabritius</hi> aunſwered: I confeſſe it is a fault to bee in loue, but yet it is a greater fault for thee to bee ſo obſtinate as thou art. For loue proceedeth of witt and diſcretion: but obſtinacy, commeth of folly and great ygnoraunce. Yf perchaunce the kyng aſk the courtiers opinion in thoſe matters they diſcourſed, if hee know his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to agree wyth the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, let him tell it him hardely: but if it bee contrary, let hym hold hys peace, and not contend againſt him, framyng ſome honeſt excuſe to concele hys oppinon. But if perhaps the king were obſtinate, and bent to his oppi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in any thing, and that through his ſelf will and obſtinacy, hee woold doo any thing vnreaſonable, or preiudiciall to his common wealth, and that great detryment might come thereby: yet for all this, in ſuch caſe the beelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued courtier ſhoold not at that inſtant bee to playn with hym, to let hym vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his error, neyther yet ſhoold hee ſuffer him altogeether to paſſe hys way vntouched, but in ſome fyne maner and proper woords (as may beecome the place beſt) to geeue him to vnderſtand the troth. But to vſe it with more diſcretion, hee ſhall not neede beefore them all to open hys whole mynd, but to keepe his oppynion ſecrete, expecting a more apter tyme, when the kyng ſhall bee apart in his priuy chamber, and then frankly to tell hym his hole mynd, with all humylity and reuerence, and to ſhew him the plaine
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21411:304"/>
troth, wythout keeping any one thing from his knowledge. For otherwyſe in tellyng the kyng openly, hee ſhoold make him aſhamed: and in <abbr>dyſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng</abbr> his fault alſo priuily, hee ſhoold not bee admoniſhed of hys error com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Now therefore let our concluſion bee, that the courtier that proceeds in his matters, rather with oppinion and obſtinacy, then diſcretion and iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement: ſhall neuer bee in fauor with the Prince, nor yet beeloued in the court. For it is as neceſſary for the courtier, that will ſeeke the fauor of the prince and loue of the court, to impoſe his tongue to ſylence: as it is to dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his body to all maner of ſeruyce. I know there are ſome ſuch raſh, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreete, and arrogant fooles, that as much doo boſt and reioice to haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vndiſcreetly to the king, and without reſpect of his princely maieſty: as if they had doon ſome maruelous thankfull ſeruice, with whom truely no man ought to bee greatly offended, for ſuch fond boſtes and vaunts as they make, and much leſſe alſo with that that happens to them afterward. The courtier alſo muſt bee well aduyſed, that albeeit the kyng for his pleaſure doo priuely play wyth his hands, or ieſt with his tong with the courtier, and that hee take great pleaſure in it: yet that hee in no caſe preſume to doo the lyke, (yea though hee were aſſured the kings maieſty woold take it well:) but let him modeſtly beehaue him ſelf, and ſhew by his woords and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce that hee thinketh the prince dooth honor him, in pleaſing his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to vſe thoſe paſtymes and pleaſant deuyſes, with ſo vnwoorthy a perſon as hee is. For the prince may lawfully play, and ſport him ſelf with his lords and gentlemen: but ſo may not they again wyth him. For ſo dooing, they might bee counted very fond and lyght. With a mans compagnions and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equals it is lawfull for euery man to bee mery and play with all. But wyth the prince, let no man ſo hardy once preſume further, more then to ſerue, honor, and obey him. So that the wyſe courtier, muſt indeuor him ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to come in fauor by his wiſedom, and courtly beehauiour, in matters of weight and importaunce: and by great modeſty and grauity, in things of ſport and paſſe tyme. Therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Apothegmes</hi> ſayth, that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades,</hi> amongſt the Greekes a woorthy captayn, and a man of hys own nature diſpoſed to much myrth and pleaſure, beeing aſked once by ſome of hys familiar frends why hee neuer laughed in theaters, bankers, and other common plays where hee was, aunſwered them thus. Where others eat, I faſt: where others take pain &amp; play, I reſt mee &amp; am quiet: where other ſpeak I am ſilent: where they laugh, I am curteous, &amp; ieſt not. For wiſe men are neuer knowen but among fooles, and light perſons. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courtier ſhall vnderſtand, or heere tell of pleaſant things to bee laughed at, let him in any caſe (if he can) fly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe great laughters &amp; foolries? that hee bee not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps moued too much with ſuch toys, to laugh to loud, to clap his hands, or to doo other geſtures of the body, or admirations to vehement, accompanied rather with a rude and barbarous maner of beehauiour, then wyth a cyuyll and modeſt noblenes. For ouer great and exceſſiue laughter was neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered of wiſedome, neither ſhall hee euer bee counted wyſe of others that vſeth it. There are alſo an other ſort of courtiers that ſpeak ſo coldly, and laugh ſo dryly, and with ſo yl a grace, that it were more pleaſure to ſee them weepe, then to laugh. Alſo to nouel or to tell tales to delyght others, and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:305"/>
to make them laugh, you muſt bee as brief as you can, that you weary not, &amp; comber not the auditory: pleaſant and not byting nor odyous. Els it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth oft times, that wanting any of theſe condicions, from ieſting they come many tymes to good earneſt. <hi>Elius Spartianus</hi> in the lyfe of the Emperor <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerus</hi> ſayth that the ſaid Emperor had in his court a pleaſaunt foole, and hee ſeeing the foole one day in his domps and cogitacions, aſked hym what hee ayled to bee ſo ſadd? The foole made aunſwer. I am deuyſing with myſelf what I ſhoold doo to make thee mery. And I ſwere to thee (my lord <hi>Seuerus</hi>) that for as much as I way thy lyfe deere, poſſible I ſtudy more in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nights for the tales I ſhall tell thee in the morow after, then doo thy Senators tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that they muſt decree on the next day. And I tell thee further (my lord <hi>Seuerus</hi>) that to bee pleaſaunt and delighting to the prince, hee muſt neyther bee a very foole, nor altogeether wyſe. But though hee bee a foole, yet hee muſt ſmatter ſomewhat of a wiſe man: and if hee bee wyſe, hee muſt take a lyttle of the foole for his pleaſure. And by theſe examples wee may gather, that the courtier muſt needes haue a certein modeſty and comely grace, as well in ſpeakyng, as hee muſt haue a ſoft and ſweete voice in ſinging. There are alſo ſome in court, that ſpare not to goe to noble mens bords to repaſt, which beeing in deede, the vnſeemely grace it ſelf, yet in their woords and talk at the boord they woold ſeeme to haue a maruelous good grace, wherein they are oft deceyued. For if at tymes the Lords and gentlemen laugh at them, it is not for any pleaſure they take in their talk, but for the yl grace, and vncomly geſtures they vſe in their talke. In the bankets and feaſts cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyers make ſome tymes in the ſommer, there are very oft ſuch men in theyr company, that if the wyne they drank tooke theyr condition, yt ſhoold bee drunk either colder, or whotter then it is.</p>

                     <p>THe courtier that cometh newly to the court to ſerue there, muſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly learn to know thoſe that are in aucthority, and fauor in the court, &amp; that are the princes officers. For if hee doo otherwiſe, neither ſhoold hee bee acquainted with any noble man or gentleman, or any other of the princes ſeruaunts, neither woold they alſo geeue him place, or let him in whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee woold. For wee bee not conuerſant with him wee know not, &amp; not beeing conuerſant with him, wee truſt him not, and diſtruſting him, wee commit no ſecrets to him: So that hee that will come in fauor in the court, muſt make him ſelf known, &amp; bee frend to all in generall. And hee muſt take heede that hee begin not to ſodainly to bee a buſy ſuter in his own priuate affairs, or for his frend, for ſo hee ſhalbee ſoone reputed for a buſy ſoliciter, rather then a wiſe courtier. Therefore hee that wil purchaſe fauor and credite in the court, muſt not bee to carefull to preferre mens cauſes, and to entermedle in many matters. For the nature of princes is, rather to commit their affairs in the hands &amp; truſt of graue and repoſed men, then to buſy &amp; importunate ſoliters.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:21411:305"/>
The courtier alſo may not bee negligent to viſyt the prelates, gentelmen, and the fauored of the court, nor to make any difference beetween the one &amp; the other: and not onely to vyſyt their parents and frends, but his enemies alſo. For the good courtier ought to endeuour him ſelf the beſt hee can to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept all thoſe for his frends at leaſt, that hee can not haue for parents and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folks. For amongſt good and vertuous courtiers, there ſhould neuer bee ſuch bloudy hate, that they ſhould therefore leaue one to company with an other, and to bee courteous one to another. Thoſe that bee of baſe mynd, doo ſhew their cankred harts by forbearing to ſpeak, but thoſe that bee of noble blood &amp; valiaunt courage, beegynne firſt to fight, ere they leaue to ſpeak togethers. There is alſo an other ſort of courtiers, which beeing ſometimes at the table of noble men, or els where when they heare of ſome quarell or priuate dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, they ſhew them ſelues in offer like fyerce lyons, but if afterwards their help bee craued in any thing, and that they muſt needes ſtand by theyre frend and draw on his ſide: then they ſhew them ſelues as ſtill as lambs, and gentle inough to bee intreated. Amongſt others the new come courtier hath to bee acquainted withall, hee muſt learn to know thoſe the prince fauoreth, and loueth beſt, on whom hee muſt attend and wayt vppon, and doo all the ſeruice hee can, without grudge and diſdaigne. For there is no kyng, but farre of on hym, hath an other kyng, that ſtill contrarieth his mynd, and preuenteth him of his intent and pleaſure: And euer neere vnto him ſome, whom hee loueth and fauoreth, that may diſpoſe of the prince as hee lyſteth. <hi>Plutarke</hi> wryting to <hi>Traian</hi> ſayd theſe woords. I haue (O <hi>Traian</hi>) great pyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on thee, for the firſt day thou tookeſt vppon thee the Imperiall crowne of the Romayn Empire, of a free man thou thraldſt thy ſelf to bondage. For onely you other princes haue autority to geeue lyberty to all others, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to graunt it to your ſelues, ſaying more ouer, that vnder the colour of royall lyberty, you ſhall remayn more ſubiect, then your own ſubiects that ere obey you. For if you commaund many in theyre houſes, alſo one alone after commaundeth you in your own court. Now although many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the prince, or that hee would follow the counſell but of a few, or that hee loued one aboue an other, or that hee conſented one alone ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uern hym, thee good courtyer neede not once open his mouth to reaſon of the matter. For ſo it myght eaſely fall out, hee ſhould beegynne out of hand to feele in the court, of what importaunce yt were to enter into ſuch diſcours of the prynce, and afterwards to goe home to his own houſe, to end yt with bitter teares. Fyrſt to purchaſe the hygh indygnation of the prince, ſecondly to bee dyſdeigned of the court, thirdly to bee caſt quyte out of fauor, fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee exyled and baniſhed the verge of the court, and fyftly and laſtly to end the reſt of his wofull dayes in vile and myſerable place. Now if it bee hard to compaſſe to get into the princes fauor, I thynk yt no very ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at leaſt hee ſeeke to bee in fauor wyth him that is in the prynces fauor.

<pb facs="tcp:21411:306"/>
to his maieſty. But to the contrary, wee no ſooner ſpeak of thoſe that bee in fauor, &amp; beeloued of the prince, but they are not onely w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſpeede aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed what was ſpoken of them: but they further dyuine what wee thought of them. Therefore my frend courtier, ſyth it lyeth not in thee to diminiſh or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire his credit, that is in fauor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, &amp; beeloued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court: neither to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place his matters &amp; ſuyts hee taketh in hand, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou haſt no autority to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme &amp; gouern the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale, nor to redreſſe &amp; amend the wrongs &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries receiued, I would wiſh thee to follow my counſel. If thou ſpy the fauts &amp; imperfections of the court, that thou rather ſuffer &amp; abide them, in keepyng them ſecret: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſeeme to reproue them openly, when thou ſeeſt princes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues contented to diſſemble &amp; couer them priuely. It is therefore the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der counſel, to follow and ſerue thoſe that are in fauor &amp; credit, then to purſue them in woord or deede. And therefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courtier muſt bee very choyſe with whom hee is familiar, to whom hee ſpeaketh, whom hee truſteth, who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him, and of whom hee receyueth all his intellygence. For there is great difference beetweene the woords that are ſpoken, and the intent &amp; meanyng wyth which they were ſpoken. For the bowells and intrails of courtiers are ſo damnable, and their harts ſo crooked, and diuerted from the right path way of bounty and goodnes, that the new and ignorant courtier ſhall think hym ſelf much profited by their aduices, and admonitions, when in deede they ſhal but deceiue him: and ſhall think hee was well counſelled, when hee ſhall fynd hym ſelf the moſt deceyued in the world, and in greater anger then beefore. There are ſome alſo ſo lytle contented wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, and ſo ill recompenſed for their ſaruice, that they are not onely not hys frends, but they practyſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to purchaſe hym moe enemies. And when the courtier ſeeth, that hee that is in fauor and credyt, dooth in deede ſtyck cloſe wyth hym vnfaynedly, what neede hee care then, though all the reſt bee his enemies. And the good courtier muſt conſider, that hee goeth not to the court to reuenge iniuryes, but onely to purchaſe honor and profyt. To whom alſo I geeue counſell, that hee bee not enemy to him that is in fauor, nor frend to his enemy: and yet it ſhall bee beſt for him to bee frend to all, and enemy to none, if hee can poſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Who ſo euer deſyreth to bee well thought of in the court, and to bee bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of courtyers, it is better for him to ſuffer iniuries doone hym, then hee hym ſelf to bee a procurer of them to others. And for the iniuries, detracty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and mutynyngs that they ſhall rayſe againſt the fauored of the court, no man ought to truſt any other perſon then hym ſelf: ſyth that for the moſt part whom they doo truſt, (when hee ſhall haue neede of the good report, and credit of him that is in fauor with the prince, thinkyng to doo hym a peece of great ſaruice) hee ſhall not care to vnfold to hym euen the bottome of hys frends ſecrets, whych were commytted to him in great ſecreſy. Hee muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo conſyder that hee can not poſſibly in a ſhort tyme grow in fauor wyth the prynce, nor come alſo to bee accepted for a frend of hym that is in fauor about the prince: but the ſooner to haſten his good fortune, hee muſt acquaint him ſelf thoroughly with the officers and ſeruants of the beeloued, and doo them a thowſand pleaſures dayly, aſwell in courteous woords, as in ſeruyng their turnes alſo w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> money or iewels, preſenting them euer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome prety ſmal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, to haue them in mynd, and to remember them to their maiſters.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:21411:306"/>
For the trew order of this diſorder, is in effect to bee rather frend to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, then familiar or beeloued with their maſters, that are in ſo great fauor: hee muſt alſo bee informed, which of his ſeruants (that is in eſtimacion wyth the prince) is in beſt credit with his maſter, &amp; him hee muſt ſeeke to make hys frend aboue al other his fellows. For euen as the prince hath a ſeruant whom hee loueth, that leads him altogether: euen ſo likewiſe hath the fauored courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a ſeruant about him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth him. There is no wil ſo free &amp; lyberal, neither any lord ſo high &amp; abſolute, nor iudge ſo vpright a iuſticer, but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end hee geeueth more truſt &amp; credit to one, then to an other. And hereof proceedes moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly, that wee loue not thoſe wee ought to loue, but thoſe whom wee fanſy moſt. Now therefore following our intent, touching the viſitacion of courtiers, hee muſt lay watch, &amp; conſider wel to procure knowledge, firſt, if any ſuch noble men, or other his frends, (which hee hath deuotion to viſyt) bee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, or withdrawen to their bed cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, for ſome priuate buſynes of theirs, for if it were ſo, they woold rather think hee came to trouble them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to viſit them. And therefore hee that is wiſe (in viſiting his fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds) may not be too im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune vpon them to preaſe into their bed cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, neither to bee too tedious &amp; vnpleaſant in his woords. There are ſome ſo ſolitary, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> woold neuer be vy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyted, &amp; others that deſires to bee viſited euery day, others there bee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> woold the viſitacion ſhoold bee ſhort, others that take ſuch pleaſure to heare a long diſcours, that hee woold his tale ſhoold neuer bee ended. So that the courtier muſt looke into the natures of men, &amp; ſo to frame his viſitacions, according to the condicions of their mynd: and to remember his viſitations to great, &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue men, bee not ſo oft &amp; dayly, that they bee troubleſome to him: nor ſo ſeldome, that they may think them ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, &amp; that they had forgotten him. That on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerueth the name of a trew viſitacion, where the perſon viſyted may not bee troubled with importunacy, nor the viſyter may dymyniſh any part of his credyt and eſtimacion, and alſo that hee preiudice not his own commodyty in his affaires. I ſpeak it for ſome that are ſo troubleſome in their viſytacions, &amp; ſo fooliſh and tedious in their woords, not knowing how to make an end, that wee may better call them troubleſome, enuious, and impudent, then honeſt vyſiters, and faithfull frends. And therefore wee ſhould leaue them ſo conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wee vyſyt, that they ſhoold rather bee angry to leaue our company, then that they ſhould complayn of our importunity: geeuing them rather occaſyon to meete vs with a pleaſant countenaunce, when wee enter into their houſe, then to make them hyde them ſelues, or fly from vs, when they ſee vs, &amp; to ſay they are not within. And mee thinks in deede where wee haue not great and ſtraight frendſhip, or els ſome affaires of great importaunce that toucheth vs much, it ſhould bee ſufficient to vyſyt our frends and acquaintance, once in a moneth: and where they would ſee vs more oftner, let vs carry till they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playn, and fynd fault, and ſend to vs to let vs vnderſtand it, and not that wee bee ſo ready to come to offer and preſent our ſelues vnto them, onleſſe the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of our cauſe doo vrge vs. There are ſome perſons ſo vndiſcreete in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vyſited, that when others come to ſee them, eyther they make the gates to bee ſhutte vppon them, or they cauſe their ſeruants to ſay they are not within, or els they get them out at the backdore, or they fayn that they are a lytle a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:21411:307"/>
that they had rather ſee a ſeriant enter into his houſe to arreſt them for debt, then to bee cumbred wyth theſe lothſome and pratyng vyſyters. Alſo yt ys not fyt to goe ſee their frends at vnlawfull howers, as about dynner or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per tyme: for thoſe that are vyſyted, wyll rather thynk they come to dyne or ſuppe wyth them, then of curteſy and good wyll to ſee them. It happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſometymes, that many are braue and rytch in apparell, that keepe but a poore and mean ordynary at their table, ſparyng from their mouth to lay yt vppon their backs: and therefore they are very loth, and offended, that any of their frends or famylyars ſhould take them at meales to iudge of them: for they thynk yt leſſe payn to faſt from meat ſecretly, then that their ſcarcety ſhould openly bee diſcouered. Alſo the laws of honeſty, and ciuylity, doo not permit any man to enter into the houſe, hall, or chamber of an other, wythout knockyng, or callyng fyrſt at the doore. For that onely pryuyledge to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me into the houſe ſodeynly, and ſpeak neuer a woord, beelongeth to the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or maſters of the houſe. Alſo it is not good to goe ſee hys frend when hee is at play, for yf hee bee a loſer, it can not bee but hee wyll chafe and bee in choler (in hys mynd) wyth his frend, to come then to trouble hym, and to let hym of his play: And yf haply hee were a wynner beefore his frend came to ſee him, and afterwards chaunce to bee a loſer agayn: hee will lay thoccaſyon of his loſſe vppon his frend that came of good wyl to ſee hym, and ſay that hee turned hys good luck away from him, and that hee came but to trouble him, takyng it rather for an offence and iniury doone him, then for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good loue or duty ſhewed him. If our frend in lyke manner whom wee goe to vyſyt, come out of his chamber to receyue vs, not byddyng vs come into the camber, nor to ſyt down, but ſtanding to talke wyth vs wythout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other curteſy or enterteynment, wee may eaſely perceyue by this his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of interteynment that hee geeueth vs good and honeſt leaue to depart when wee wyll. The wyſe, and fyne courtyer, will as eaſely fynd and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand hym by his ſignes, as hee wyll doo ſometymes by his woords. Alſo the courtier muſt take great heede that inſeemyng to vſe curteſy, hee happen not to make ſome fooliſh countenance in pulling of his cap, in makyng curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, coming into the hall, or taking a ſtoole to ſyt down, leſt he bee therfore mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; mocked of the ſtanders by, or noted for proud or preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptuous, for to ſtay or let at theſe triffles, a man rather getteth the name of a glorious, light, and proud: then of a graue &amp; ſober man. All things touching conſciens, ciuility, &amp; honor, the good courtier ſhould always haue in memory, &amp; beefore his eyes, when hee ſhall diſcours with his lord, or vyſyt his frend. And for the firſt bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his diſcourſe, &amp; talk with him (after they are ſet down togethers) hee muſt aſk him how his body dooth, &amp; whether all his houſe bee meery and in good health: for yt is the thyng that wee muſt firſt procure for our own priuate commodity, and ſecondly deſire yt for our frends. Alſo in the courty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers vyſitacions hee may not bee too curious or inquiſytiue of news, nether o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beeſy to tell news: for after his frend were once aduertiſed of the troth, it might bee lightly, hee woold thank him for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming &amp; comend him for his curteſy: and notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding blame him for his news, &amp; count him a lyer. And yf it happen wee fynd the party whom wee viſyt, ſad, comfortles, and in ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, although hee were not our frend, yet for that hee is a chryſtyan,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21411:307"/>
wee ought to comfort him in woords, &amp; to ſeeke alſo to help and releeue him with ſome what. <hi>Licurgus</hi> in his lawes hee made ordeyned, that it ſhould not bee lawfull for any man to come to ſee a priſoner, but hee ſhould held to dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hym: nor any poore man, but hee ſhoold relieue him: nor any ſick or diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed parſon, but hee ſhould help and comfort him to his able power. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mee thinks <hi>Licurgus</hi> had great reaſon to make this law, ſynce wee ſee that in experience, that a mans mynd, for one onely thing that is geeuen him, ys better contented and ſatiſfyed: then with a thouſand woords that they can ſpeak to hym. And if his houſe whom they goe to vyſyt, and where hee dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, bee his own inheritaunce, and fee ſymple, or that hee hath it by leaſe or purchaſe, or that hee buylt it out of the ground, or if hee haue repayred or new coated yt, the courtier muſt pray him to let him ſee yt, and when hee hath ſeen yt hee muſt greatly commend it to him: for all mortall men haue this commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fault and humor, that wee muſt bee prayſed of our dooings and not reproued for our faults. Further if they vyſyt any ſick perſon, they muſt remember they ſpeak but lytle to him, and that ſoftly, and pleaſant matters: for otherwiſe yt ſhould ſeeme (and they wil alſo beeleeue) hee came to ſee him, rather to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauat his ſicknes more, then to comfort him. Wee muſt euer make ſhort vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſytacions, not onely with the ſick &amp; dyſeaſed, but the whole &amp; ſound. And then the good courtier muſt take his leaue of them, when hee is euen in his moſt pleaſant diſcourſe, to thend they may intreat him to tary longer: and not to tary till they ſeeme to licence him by outward ſignes &amp; ceremonies: &amp; hee that ſhal goe viſyt an other, let him take heede hee bee not ſo long, &amp; tedious in hys talke, that the parſon whom hee viſyteth doo riſe beefore him. For it were too playn a token hee were weery of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany &amp; long tariyng, ſyth hee roſe bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to geeue him occaſion to depart. Yf his wife whom hee viſiteth, bee not a ſiſter or kynſwomen of the courtiers y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> viſyts him, or that they bee not of very familyar acquaintance togethers, hee ſhould not once ſeeme to aſk for her, much leſſe to deſire to ſee her. For as <hi>Scipio</hi> ſayeth, a man ſhould not truſt any to ſee his wife, nor to prooue his ſweord. It is alſo a cuſtome vſed among courtiers, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when they goe to any mans houſe to ſee him, beefore they light of on their horſe, they ſend to know whether hee bee within or no. And when the courtier taketh his leaue of him hee hath viſyted, hee muſt not ſuffer the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilman to bring him out of his chamber to accompany him, much leſſe to come down the ſtaiers with him: which if hee vſe in this manner, the other ſhallbee bound to thank him for his comming, &amp; ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend him for his ciuility. And if it happen when wee goe to vyſyt ſome noble man, or other beeloued of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court at his lodging, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at our comming hee is redy to come out of his houſe to ride abrode in the fields to take ayre, or to ride to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court to ſolicyte ſome of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, or to ride abrode into the town for his pleaſure, the dylygent courtyer muſt willyngly accompany him, &amp; offer him al the ſeruice hee can: &amp; ſo hee ſhal deſerue double thanks of him, thone for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng, &amp; the other for his gentle offer &amp; company. To viſyt the princes ſeruants, it is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner (for that they are always occupied in the princes ſeruice) neither ſhal they haue ſuch time of leyſure as other haue. And beecauſe they haue no time comodious to ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at home at their own houſes, yet at the leaſt the good courtier muſt needes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them at times when they goe abroade. For there is more reaſon the

eſteemed courtier ſhould make more of him that accompanieth him, then of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other that is too importunat &amp; toubleſome to him.</p>

For that courtier that runneth from table to table, to eat of thers coſt, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue his meat free, is not ſo ſparing of his purſe, as hee is too prodygall and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh of his good reputacion. Therefore <hi>Eſchines</hi> the phyloſopher beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded one day, what a man ſhould doo to bee counted good, hee aunſwered thus. To beecome a parfyt Greeke, hee muſt goe to the church willingly, and of good deuotion, and to the warres of neceſſity: but to feaſts and bankets, neither of will, nor of neceſſity, onleſſe it bee to doo them honor and pleaſure that doo inuite thee. <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> writeth, that themperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi> prohibyted in Rome, that no man ſhould conuite eche other, to feaſt, or ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket with an other, but if his frend woold doo him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honor to come to his feaſt, that then hee ſhould ſend him home to his houſe, of that meat hee ſhould haue had at the feaſt and banket with them at their houſes. And whan hee was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of certayn of his frends what hee ment to make this law: hee gaue them this aunſwer. The cauſe that moued mee, good frends, to forbyd playes, and bankets in Rome was: becauſe in play, no man can keepe him ſelf from ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, &amp; terrible blaſpheming the name of god: and in bankets euery man is geeuen to detect and defame his neighbor. <hi>Cicero</hi> reconteth of <hi>Cato</hi> the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, that hee lying in his death bed, at the mercy of god, ſhould ſay theſe woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Fower things I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber I haue doon in my life, wherein I haue rather ſhewed my ſelf a voluptuous &amp; negligent <hi>Barbarian,</hi> then a wiſe &amp; good Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main citiſin, for the w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I fynd my ſelf ſore greeued.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is this. For that I ſpent a whole day &amp; forgot to ſerue the gods, &amp; did not profyt my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale in any thing, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I ſhould neuer haue doone. For it is as great a diſhonor for a philoſopher to bee counted an idle &amp; negly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent perſon: as it is for a noble hart, to bee counted a rank coward.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is for that ſafly I myght once haue gon by land, &amp; perilouſly I haſarded my ſelf vpon the water. A thing w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I ſhoold wel haue let alone. For neuer no wiſe man ſhould euer haue put him ſelf into peril, onles yt were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſeruice of the gods, for the increaſe of his honor, or for the defence of his countrey.</p>
                     <p>The thyrd is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I opened once a great ſecret, &amp; matter of importaunce to a woman, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I ought leſſe to haue doon then al the reſt. For in graue matters, &amp; things of counſell, there is no woman capable to geeue counſel, &amp; much leſſe to take it, &amp; leaſt of all to keepe it ſecret.</p>
                     <p>The fowerth was, that an other tyme I was contented to bee ouercome by a frend of mine that earneſtly inuyted mee to his houſe to dinner, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I went wyth him, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I ſhoold not haue doone. For to ſay the troth, there was neuer famous nor woorthy perſon that went to eat in an other mans houſe, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee diminiſhed his liberty, haſardyng alſo his grauyty and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion to the rumor &amp; brute of others. The w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> woords beeing ſo wiſely ſpoken
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21411:308"/>
by the prudent <hi>Cato,</hi> were wel woorthy to bee noted &amp; caried away, &amp; ſo much the more, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> beeing now drawing to his laſt home, &amp; euen in his laſt breathing hower hee onely ſpake of theſe fower things &amp; no moe, whereof, although hee were a Romain, yet hee ſhewed to vs a repenting mynd. But woe is mee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> albeeit I beare the name of a chriſtian, yea &amp; that I am ſo in deede, yet in that laſt day when nature ſommons mee, I feare mee, &amp; beeleeue aſſuredly I ſhal haue cauſe to repent mee of more then fower things. Now by theſe thyngs heretofore recyted wee may eaſely coniecture, that albeeit wee are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee entreated &amp; requeſted in many things, yet in this onely to goe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers tables to feaſt. &amp; in ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge houſes wee ſhoold not bee intreated, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compelled &amp; againſt our wills. And where the courtier is forced by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunancy to accept the bidding, without offring him ſelf beefore, hee deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth as great tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks of the bidder for his comming, as the other did in bidding him. For if it ſhould not bee ſo, it ſhould ſeeme rather a dynner for ſtraungers that trauels by the way, then for noble men and gentelmen that comes from the court. For that day the courtier graunteth to dine with any man, the ſame day hee byndeth him ſelf to bee beeholding to him that bids him: for although hee come to him of good will, yet to acquite his curteſy doon him, hee is bound of neceſſity. Alſo it is a ſmall reputacion (and woorthy great reproch) that a courtier make his boſte hee hath eaten at al the tables and officers boords in the court, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no man can ſay hee hath once been at dinner or ſupper w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him at his own houſe. And truely I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber I knew once a courtier y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d aboue two hundreth ducats by yeare, who told mee, &amp; aſſured mee hee neuer bought ſtick of wood to warm him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, nor pot to ſeeth his meat in, neither ſpyt to roſt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all, nor that euer hee had any cater for his prouiſion, ſaue only y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee had made a regiſter of many noble mens boords, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee equally deuided his dyners &amp; ſuppers. By means wherof hee ſaued al his charges, ſaue only his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s boord wages. But what vilenes or diſcurteſy coold equal the miſery &amp; ſhame of this careles courtier? Suer not that of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meaneſt &amp; pooreſt ſlaue of the world, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyueth only by his hyer: no it deſerueth not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared vnto it. For to what end deſire wee the goods of this world, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by them wee may bee honored, relieue our parents &amp; kinſmen, and thereby alſo winne vs new frends? what ſtate or condicion ſo euer hee be of, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath inough &amp; abundance, wee are not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to eſteeme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more of him for that, nor to doo him the more honor, but only for that hee ſpendeth it wel, &amp; woorſhipfully, and for his honor, if he bee honorable. And this wee ſpeak of gentleman as of cyti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyn. And hee that in court makes profeſſion to dine at other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s tables, I da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vndertake if they dine betimes on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holly day, hee wil rather loſe ſaruice in the morning, then dinner at noone. And if any frend come to lye w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe ſort of courtiers, &amp; that hee bee but newly come to the court, ſtraight ways he wil haue him with him to dinner, and bring him to ſalute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gentleman where hee dines that day, ſaying that hee was bold to bring his kinſman and frend with him to ſalute him, and all this is not ſo much to bring hym acquainted wyth him, as it is to ſpare his meat at home for bothe. And yet they haue an other knack of court fyner the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thys. They flatter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pages &amp; ſeruants, beecauſe they ſhould euer geeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the beſt wine at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> certayn familiar noddes &amp; ſwete woords they entertain the lords, ſhewers, &amp; caruers, &amp; make much of them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould ſet beefore them full dyſhes &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt and deintieſt meat.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:309"/>
There are alſo ſome of theſe courtiers that to bee wel wayted vpon at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; to make them his frends, doo ſometimes preſent the ſteward with a vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet cap, the ſhewers with a paire of waſhed or perfume gloues, the pages w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ſweord girdel, and the butlers or cooberd keepers with ſome other prety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or deuiſe. And it chaunceth oft times in noble mens houſes that there are ſo many geſts to dyne and ſup with him dayly, that many times the boord wil not hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al by a great number: w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> when they once perceiue, to ſee how quickly &amp; with what ſpeede the courtiers take their places to ſet them down &amp; to bee ſuer of a roome, it is a world to ſee it. But oh I woold to god they were ſo happy &amp; dilygent to goe to the church &amp; heare a ſermon, as they are buſy to get them ſtooles to ſyt at the table. And if perhaps a courtier come late, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the table bee all ready full, and the lurch out, yet hee will not bee aſhamed to eat his meat neuertheles. For albeeit hee can not bee placed at his eaſe yet he is ſo bold &amp; ſhameles, that rather then fayle hee will ſyt of half a buttock, or beehynd one at the table. I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber I ſaw once at a noble mans boord three courtiers ſet vpon one ſtoole, like the fower ſonnes of Amon, and whan I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked them for it, and told them it was a ſhame for them, they aunſwered mee merely agayn, that they did it not for that there wanted ſtooles, but to prooue if neede were if one ſtoole woold beare them three. Such may well bee called greedy gluttons, &amp; ſhameles prowlers, without reſpect or honeſty, that when they are dead, would bee buried in the higheſt place of the church: &amp; when they are aliue, litle force at whoſe table they ſit, or how they ſyt, litel regarding their honor or eſtate. Truely for him that is poore and needy, to ſeeke his meat and drink where hee may come by it beſt it is but meete: but for the gorgeous cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyer, bee deckt with gold, bee buttoned &amp; bee iewelled, ietting in his veluets &amp; ſilks, to begge &amp; ſeeke his dinner dayly at euery mans boord, beeing nobly &amp; honorably enterteined of the prince, &amp; able to beare his countenaunce: what reproch, defame, &amp; diſhonor is it to him? Hee that vſeth daily to runne to other mens tables, is oft times forced to ſyt loweſt at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boord vpon a broken ſtoole, &amp; to be ſerued with a ruſty knyfe, to eat in foule diſhes, &amp; to drink for a change whot water, &amp; wine more then half full of water, &amp; to eat hore bread, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of all others yet is worſt of all, euery one of the ſeruants lookes ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on him, &amp; are angry with him in their mynds. Truely hee that with theſe condicions goeth abrode to ſeeke his dinner, were better in my opinion to faſt with bread &amp; water at home, then to fill his belly abroad. But ſuch mens reward, that haunts mens houſes in this maner, is this in the end, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men to whoſe houſes they come to, are offended with them, the ſtewards of the houſe murmure at them, the pages &amp; ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts mocks them, &amp; laughs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſcorn, the taſters &amp; cup bearers chafe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them in their mynds, the cubberd keepers wonder at them, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clarks of the kychyn thinks them importunat and ſhameles creatures. Wherefore it followeth (who ſoeuer wil obſerue it) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo ſoone as the ſeruants ſee him once come into the dyning cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, ſome of them hydes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtoole where hee woold ſyt down, others ſet beefore him the woorſt meat of the boord &amp; the filthieſt diſhes they haue, &amp; therefore hee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> may haue at home at his houſe his poore litle pyttance wel dreſt, a faire white table clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th, a bright knife, new &amp; white bread, wood &amp; candel in the winter, &amp; other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries: if hee like better to goe from table to table, from kychyn to kychyn, &amp;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:21411:309"/>
from one buttery to an other, I wil ſuppoſe hee dooth it for great ſpare &amp; hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or for want of honeſty &amp; good maners. Now hee that keepes an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry houſe, &amp; remayns always at home, may dine if it bee in the ſomer ſeaſon, in his ſhyrt if hee liſt, hee may ſyt whan hee will, and where it pleaſe him, hee drinks his wine freſh, &amp; hath the flyes driuen from his table with the ventola, hee diſdaigneth the court &amp; noble mens boords, keeping his own as frank and as ſparing as hee liſt, &amp; no man to gayn ſay him: yea &amp; after meat hee is at ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſyt ſtill, &amp; take his eaſe, or to walk abrode in the ſhade as hee wil. And in winter if perhaps hee bee wer, hee ſtraight ſhifts him, &amp; changes all hys clothes, gets him a furred night gown on the back of hym, &amp; a paire of warm ſlyppers to heat his cold feete with all, hee eates his meat warm &amp; ſmoking whot, &amp; takes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee likes beſt, hee drinks white wine, red wine or claret wine as hee thinks good, and neede neuer to care for them that beehold hym. And therefore ſo great priuileges as thoſe bee of lyberty, the courtier ſhould neuer refuſe to buy them for his money, much leſſe for the gayn of a meales meat he ſhould leaue to enioy them. But if the courtier will needes determyn to vyſyt noble mens boords, hee muſt bee very ware, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in comming to a noble mans table, hee doo not ſo much commend his fare &amp; ordinary, that hee complayn of other men 3 tables where hee hath fed. For it is a kynd of treaſon to defame &amp; ſclauader thoſe, whoſe houſes they are wont to viſyt oft. And when hee ys ſet at the table, the courtier muſt beehaue him ſelf modeſtly, hee muſt eat tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly, and fynely, hee muſt delay his wine with water, and ſpeak but lytel: ſo that thoſe that are preſent can not but prayſe hym for his temperancy and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber diet, but alſo for his wiſedome and moderat ſpeach. To feede mannerly is to bee vnderſtand, not to blow his noſe in his napkyn, nor to lean his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes vppon the table, not to eat to leaue nothyng in the dyſh, not to fynd faults wyth the cookes, ſaying the meat is not inough, or not well dreſſed. For yt were a great ſhame for the courtier to bee noted of the wayters, to bee a belly gut and to bee counted a groſſe feeder. There are ſome alſo that make them ſelues ſo familiar and homly in the houſe, that they are not contented w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that is ſerued them in the dyſh, but ſhamefully they pluck that to them that ys left in other dyſhes, ſo that they are eſteemed for Ieſters, no leſſe ſawſy and malepert in their order, then inſatiable in their beaſtly eating. The good cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tier muſt alſo take heede hee lay not his armes to faire on the table, nor that hee make any noyſe wyth his teeth or his tongue, nor ſmack with his mouth when hee eateth, and that hee drink not wyth both his hands on the cup, nor caſt his eies too much vpon the beſt diſhes, that hee knaw, nor teare his bread w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his teeth, that hee lick not his fyngers, nor adoone eating beefore others, nor to haue too greedy an appetite to the meat or ſauce hee eates, and that in drynkyng hee gulp not with his throte. For ſuch manner of feedyng, rather beecommeth an alehouſe, then a noble mans table. And although the courty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can not goe ouer all the dyſhes that comes to the boord, yet at leaſt let him proue a litle of euery one, and then hee muſt praiſe the good cookry &amp; fine dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng of them al. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the noble men &amp; gentlemen that inuite any to their boord, take it vncurteouſly, &amp; are aſhamed if the inuyted praiſe not their meat and drink they geeue them, and not onely the noble men are aſhamed of yt, but alſo the other officers that haue the charge to ſee yt well dreſſed,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:310"/>
&amp; in good order. Always he that eateth at an other mans table, to doo as hee ought, ſhoold praiſe the woorthines of him that bad him (yea though perhaps hee made a lye) and commend the great care and diligence of his officers in furniſhing his table with ſo good meats, and in ſettyng on yt foorth in ſo good order. I ſay not without a cauſe that ſometime a praiſe with a lye may well ſtand togethers, ſence wee ſee ſome noble mens tables ſo ſclender furnyſhed, and that his ordinary ſhould ſeeme rather a preparatiue ſupper and dyet for a ſick man that means to take phiſick in the next morning, then an ordynary, or dinner for Eaſter day. And therefore I ſay, that of right the lords and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are pleaſed, when they here their officers and ſeruants commendid. For they chooſe moſt commonly ſuch a ſteward, as they knew to bee wiſe, &amp; curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of nature: a treaſorer, trew and faythfull: a purueier, expert and diligent: a butler, haſty and melancony: the groome of his chamber, paynfull and truſty: his ſecretary, wiſe &amp; ſecret: his chappleyn ſimple, &amp; his cooke fyne &amp; curious. For many think it more glory to haue an excellent cooke in their houſe, then to haue a valyaunt captayn, to keepe a ſtrong peece, or hold. They are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in court that noble mens chappleins bee rather ſymple then ouer wiſe, or wel learned. For if hee read but lytle, hee hath the ſooner ſay ſeruice, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with alſo is more fyt to drudge and doo ſeruice about the houſe. Now therfore continuing our beegoonne purpoſe, the courtier that eateth at other mens ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, muſt ſee hee drink lytle, and that his wine bee well delayed with water. For wyne tempered with water, bringeth two commodityes: thone, it makes him ſober that drinks it, and ſhal not bee ouerſeen: thother, hee ſhall not dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper him ſelf, that the wayters haue any occaſyon to laugh at hym. Yf yt ſhould happe ſometimes that hee found the wyne well watered beefore, that yt had ſtoode a pawlyng long, or that yt were ſome what ſharp or ſower, or that the water were to whot: the good courtier ſhoold not therefore immedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly complain and fynd fault at the table, for ſo hee ſhoold ſhame the ſeruants, and make them angry with him, and alſo diſpleaſe their maiſter. Truely it ys a greefe to ſuffer yt, to ſee that hee that hath nothing at home in his own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, eyther to eat or drynk, will yet looke to bee well vſed at an other mans houſe, and is neuer ſatiſfyed. I ſpeak yt for certeyn vndiſcreete courtiers, and wanting iudgement, that beeing at any mans boord, (without any ſhame) dare diſpraiſe the cookes, and ſpeak yll of them, if perhaps the taſte of their porage and meat myſlyke them, and that it bee not good, and according to their appetit: and of the butlers, if the wyne bee not colde and freſh: of thoſe that waight aboue, if euery thing they call for, bee not doone at a beck and quickly: of the ſtewards of the houſe, if they bee not ſerued immediatly: and of the boyes and pages, if they geeue them not drink ſodeinly: of the caruers, if they carue them not to their lyking: and alſo with the clarks of the kychyn, if they ſee them not ſerued with meat ynough, that there bee inough leſt vpon the table. So that the noble mens officers (for the more part) haue more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and diſpleaſure, by the diſcontentacion of thoſe that come to their maſters table, then they haue by the euell woords their maiſters ſpeaks to them. And for this reſpect therefore no man ought to bee ſo bold as once to open his lyps to complayn of any want in an other mans houſe, as if they ſerue him wyth claret wyne, rather then with white: or with whyte, then claret. For a ryght
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:21411:310"/>
and parfect courtier, ſhoold not ſet his appetit in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> taſt nor variety of wynes, or meats in an others houſe. I graunt that it is very fitt, and lawfull for yong courtiers, to runne well, to leap farre, to throw the barre of Iron, to daunce well, to ryde a horſe well to manedge and geeue him his carere well, and to turne well, to handle his weapon well, and to break a ſtaffe well, and otherwiſe to help him ſelf with all maner of weapons: but for one to defye an other in drinking, it ſhoold bee a great ſacrilege of the courtier. The Scithiens, as ratifieth <hi>Trogꝰ Pompeius,</hi> were ſo ſober and modeſt in eating and drinking at their meats, that it was a foule fault among them to break wynd, or belch. And therefore now a days wee fynd few Scithiens, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny drinkers, which depart from the feaſt ſo full fraight, as immediatly when they are come home, they vnlode their charged ſtomack, and lay open al that they haue eaten and dronken. Wherefore hee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vſeth to drink clean, &amp; pure water, is at more liberty, then thoſe that drink wyne ſimply, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. For exceſſiue drinking of wyne, dooth not alonly troble &amp; diſtemper the brain &amp; iudgement of the drinker: but further diſcouereth to you, great &amp; horrible vices. Therfore yet touching our matter, I ſay once again, that it is a fond diſpute, and argument, to proue which of the wines were beſt, pleſant, and moſt ſweteſt, &amp; which is oldeſt or neweſt, ſharp or hard, ſoft or ſweet, cleareſt or darkeſt, or of beſt taſt or quickeſt ſauor. For to iudge of the taſt of wynes, &amp; to know the goodnes and perfection of it, rather (to ſay truely) beelongeth to a Tauerner or vintner, then rightly to an honeſt courtier. And it is fitter, and more decent alſo for him, to talk of armes and chiualrie, then to deale in diſcourſe of <hi>Bacchus</hi> feaſts. What a mockry, &amp; fooliſh nicety is it of him, that not only drinks water alone, but alſo cannot drink it in that cup, where there hath been wyne filled beefore. Hee ſhall alſo bee very circumſpect that ys bidden to a ſtraungers houſe, that hee drink not ſo deepe at a draught, that hee leaue nothing in the cuppe, neither that hee drink ſo long as hee hath breath, and the water ſtand in his eyes agayn. For the graue and ſober cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier ſhoold neuer drink, till hee might no more, nor till there were none left. Alſo when hee is at the table, hee ſhoold not enter in argument and diſpute with any, neither ſhoold hee bee obſtinat in oppinion, and much leſſe vſe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or vncomely talk: and hee muſt alſo brydle nature much, that hee crye not out in laughyng as ſome doo. For lyke as yt ſoundeth to hys reproch, to bee noted a glutton, and drunkerd: it is in lyke caſe farre woorſe, to bee accounted a foole, and a ieſter.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it preuayleth lyttle that a courtier bee moderate, and honeſt in ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng, if hee bee diſhoneſt, and inſolent in hys talk. For many times it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at noble mens boords, that they take more pleaſure in ſome, then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome: not to ſee them eat and drink well, but to heare them tell lyes, and to bee pleaſaunt at the boord. Therefore as wee haue ſaid, the wyſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer ſhoold praiſe and commend all that hee ſeeth ſerued at an other mans table, and it is not lawfull for him to diſlyke or diſpraiſe it. And further beecauſe hee is fedd at an other mans charge, hee muſt of neceſſity take all in woorth that is geeuen hym, and ſett beefore him, and not to looke to haue that that hee deſyreth. And when there is any queſtion mooued
<pb facs="tcp:21411:311"/>
at the table of the beſt and moſt delicat diſhes, &amp; of the fyneſt cookes, and of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new kinds of broths &amp; ſawces, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the fatteſt capons come, it ſhal not bee fitt for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſe courtier to ſay in that al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knoweth &amp; vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth. For how much honor it is for him to bee able to talk in martial feats, or chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualry: ſo much more diſhonor &amp; reproch it is to him, to bee ſkilfull in dreſſing of meats, and all to fill the belly. I remember that beeing one day at a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops boord, I hard a knight make great boſt &amp; vaunt, that hee coold make vii. maner of fricaſies, iiii. kinds of pyes, xii. ſorts of ſawces, and x. of fruyt tarts, and xii. dyuers ways to dreſſe egges: but to heare him tell theſe things was not to bee accounted of ſo much, as the geſtures and countenaunce hee made in telling them. For hee did lyuely ſhew with his hands the preſent making of them, the eating of them, and the right taſting of them wyth hys tongue. And beecauſe it happeneth many times that in ſome noble mans houſe there is not lyke fare and entertainment that an other hath, the cyuill courtier ſhoold not bee ſo diſhoneſt, as to make report hee leaueth that noble mans table, to goe to an others that is better ſerued. For the woorthy cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier ſhoold not haunt that table where hee fareth beſt, but where hee fyndeth him ſelf beſt welcome, and eſteemed. Ah how many noble men and knyghts ſonnes are there, that ſpare not to goe to any mans boord for his meat and drink, yea though it fall out they bee their fathers enemies: and they do it not in reſpect to reconcile them, and their fathers togeethers, but rather for a good meales meat, or more aptly to ſay, to fill their bellyes with dainties.</p>

                     <p>THe wiſe Courtier, both in court and out of court, &amp; in all places where hee cometh, muſt take great regard hee acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany with none, but with wiſe, and vertuous men. For if hee doo not, hee can not winne nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch honor by his well dooing, as hee ſhall loſe his credit, by keeping yl company. And therefore hee ſhall inforce him ſelf always to bee in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens and company of vertuous and noble men, and ſhall conferre with the moſt graue, wiſe, and honeſt gentlemen of the court: For vſing this way, hee ſhall bynd them to him, by reaſon of his daily acceſſe to them: and hee ſhall purchaſe him ſelf a good oppinion of them, beſides the good example hee ſhal leaue to others to tread his ſteps, and follow his coorſe. For what is more true, then when a yong gentleman commeth newly to the court, you ſhal ſee immediatly a company of other yong fooles, a company of amarous ſquires, light and ydle perſons, a company of troubleſom ieſters, and couetous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, beſides other yong fry in court, that when they know a new come cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier (namely beeing of great lyuing) They will ſeeke to attend vpon him, and trayn him to the luer of their affects and maner, bringing him to like of their qualities and condicions. Wherefore conningly to ſhake of the rout of theſe needy greedy retayners, hee muſt altogether feede them with fair woords, &amp; ſhew them good countenaunce, &amp; yet notwithſtanding ſeeke by al policy hee can to fly their felowſhip &amp; company. Noble mens ſonnes knights ſonnes, &amp; gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſonnes, may not think their frends ſendeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, to learn

new vyces, and wicked practiſes, but to winne them new fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and obtayne the acquaintance of noble men whoſe credit and eſtimation, with the prince may honor and countenance them, and by theyr vertues and meanes, may after a tyme bee brought into the princes fauor alſo, and dayly to ryſe in credit and reputation amongſt others. Therfor ſuch fathers as will ſend their children to the court, onles they doo fyrſt admoniſh them wel how they ought to beehaue them ſelues, ere that they recomend them to to the charge and ouerſight of ſome deare and eſpeciall frend of theirs, that will reproue them of their faults when they doo amiſſe. I ſay they were better to lay irons on there feete, and ſend them to. Bedlem or ſuch other like houſe where madd men bee kept. For if they bee bound there in irons, it is but to bring them to their wits agayne, and to make them wiſe: but to ſend them to the court loſe, and at lyberty without guyde, it is the next way to make them fooles, and worſe then mad men, aſſuring you, no greater danger nor iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry can bee doon to a yong man, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee ſent to the court, and not comitted to the charge of ſome one that ſhould take care of him, and looke ſtraightly to him. For otherwiſe, it were impoſſible hee ſhould bee there many dayes, but hee muſt needs runne into exces and foul diſorder, by meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee ſhould vtterly caſt him ſelfe away, and heape vpon their parents heads (continuall curſes, and greefes, during their liues. And therfor theire fathers) ſuppoſing after they haue once placed their ſonnes in the court, that they ſhould no more carke nor care for them, nor recken to inſtruct them to bee wiſe and vrrtuous) fynd when they come home to them againe, that they are laden with vices, ill complexioned, worſe aparelled, theire clothes al tottered and torne, hauing vainly and fondly ſpent and plaied away their mony, and worſt of al forſaken their maſters, leauing them diſpleaſid with their ſaruice. And of theſe I would admoniſh the yong courtier, beecauſe hee muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity accompaigny with other yong men, that in no caſe hee acquaynte him ſelfe with vitious and ill diſpoſed perſons, but with the honeſt, wiſe, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: amongſt whome hee ſhall put vpon him a certaine graue and ſtayed modeſty, fitting him ſelfe only to ther companies, beeing alſo apt and diſpoſed to all honeſt and vertuous exercices, decent for a right gentilman, and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courtier, ſhunning with his beſt pollicy, the light, fooliſh, and vayne toyes of others. And yet notwithſtanding theſe, my intent and meaning is not to ſeeme to perſwade or teach him to beecome an hippocrite, but only to bee cour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teous, honeſt, and wel beeloued of other yonge gentlemen: winning this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation withall, to bee eſteemed for the moſt vertuous and honeſtiſt among them, gallant and lyuely in his diſportes and paſtimes, of few woords, and ſmall conuerſation amongſt boſters and backbyters, or other wicked and naughty perſons: not to bee ſad among thoſe that are mery, nor dumme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong, thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> talke wiſely, &amp; of graue matters: nor to beleeue hee ſhould bee accounted a trimme courtier, to take his booke in his hands to pray, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will take the ball to play, or go about ſome other honeſt recreation or paſtime for exerciſe of the body. For ſo dooing, they would rather take him for a foole and an Ippocrite, then for a vertuous and honeſt yonge man.</p>
                     <p>Beeing good reaſon the child ſhould vſe the pleaſures and paſtimes of a child, yong men, diſportes and actes of youth: and old men alſo graue and wiſe
<pb facs="tcp:21411:312"/>
recreacions fyt for them. For in the end doo the beſt wee can, wee can not fly the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the fleſh, wherin wee are borne into this world. Theſe yong gentilmen courtiers muſt take heede that they become not trobleſome, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, nor quarelers, that they bee no filchers liers, vacabonds, and ſclaunderers, nor any way geeuen to vice. As for other things, I would not ſeeme to take from them their paſtyme and pleaſure, but that they may vſe them at their owne pleaſure. And in all other things lawfull and irrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable, obſeruing tyme and howers conuenient, and therewithall to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigny them ſelues with their fellows and compaignions. Alſo the yong courtier that cometh newly to the court, muſt of neceſſity bee very well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled, according to his degree and callyng, and his ſeruants that follow him well appoynted. For in court men regarde not only the houſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily hee cometh of, but marke alſo his apparel and ſeruants that follow him. And I miſlike one thing very much, that about the court they doo rather ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and reuerence a man braue and ſumptuous in apparell being vitious, then they doo a man that is graue, wiſe, and vertuous. And yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the courtier may aſſure him ſelf of this, that few will eſteeme of him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee is vertuous or nobly borne, if hee bee not al ſo ſumptuouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled and well accompanied, for then only will euery man account and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme of him. Wherfor I durſt take vpon mee to ſweare, if yt were poſſible to take oth of our bodyes, that they would ſwere they needed them not, much leſſe deſier ſo large compaſſed gownes, that euery puff of wynd myght ſwell them as the ſayles of a ſhippe, nether ſo long that trailyng on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d they gather duſt, and caſt it into our eyes. Howbeeit I think now adayes theſe fine men weare then large and wyde, and women long with traynes vpon the grounde: becauſe in the court and els where, no man makes reckning of him that ſpendeth but orderly, and onely vpon neceſſaries to go clenly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: but him they ſet by, that is prodigall, exceſſiue and ſuperfluous. And who that in his dooings and apparell is moderate, and proceedeth wiſely: they hold him in court for a miſerable and couetous man: and contrarily, hee that is prodigall and lauiſh in expence, him they count a noble and worthy perſon. Albeeit the courtier come of a noble houſe, and that hee bee yong of yeares, ritch, and welthy, yet would I lyke better hee ſhould vſe rather a certain meane and meaſure in his apparell (wering that that is comly and gentil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man like) then others of moſt coſt and worſhip. For like as they would count hym a foole for wering that hee could not pay for: So they likewiſe would thinke him ſimple, if hee ware not that that become hym, and that hee might eaſely come by. His apparell ſhould bee agreable with his yeares, that is to ſay, on the holly dayes ſome more richer and brauer then on the woorkydayes: and in the winter of the whotteſt furrs: in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer lyght garments of ſattin and damaſk: and to ryde with, ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of leſſer price and more durable. For as the wiſdome of man is knowen by his ſpeakyng: ſo is hys dyſcretyon decerned by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell. Let not the poore courtyer ſtuddy to weare or deuyſe any new or ſtrange faſhioned garment, for if hee bee of that humor, hee ſhall quickly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21411:312"/>
vndoo him ſelfe, and geeue others occaſion alſo to follow his light and vayne inuention. There are now adays found out ſo many ſtrange wayes to dreſſe meate, and ſo many faſſhions and paterns of apparell, that now they haue vniuerſities of taylers and cookes. What more greater vanity and lightnes can there bee then this? that they wil not ſuffer the mothers gownes to bee made fyt for their doughters: ſaieng that they are old and out of faſhion, and that they vſe now a new kynd of apparel &amp; attire farre from the old maner. And not withſtanding theſe gownes bee it in maner new, good, hole, cleane, ritch, and well made, and without weme, yet their doughters muſt needes haue new gownes at their mariadge. So that wee may aptly ſay, that a new folly, ſeekes alwayes a newe gowne, namely when they are light perſons, without wyt and diſcretion. And I pray you is it not a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſight in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, to ſee a fooliſh courtier weare a demie cappe, ſcant to couer his crowne of his head, to haue his bearde marquizottyd, a payr of parfumed gloues on his handes, his ſhooes cut after the beſt faſſhion, a litel cutted cape, his hoſe faire pulled out, his dublet ſleues brauely cut and pinct, his rapier and his dagger guilted by his ſyde: and then on the other ſyde the peſtilens of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hee hath in his purſe to bleſſe him with, and beeſides hee is deepe in the marchaunts booke for all thoſe things hee hath taken vp of credit of him.</p>
                     <p>Their nagges foote clothes would not bee ſo litell and narrow, that ſhould ſeeme a friars hoode, nether ſo great and large as the foote clothes of biſſhops moyles. Alſo the courtier muſt ſee that his footecloth bee good &amp; hole, cleane, and without ſpot, not tattered &amp; ſeame rent. This wee ſpeake beecauſe there are ſoome myſerable courtiers that haue their foote clothes thred bare, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſeame rent, foule and durty narro and all digged full of holes with theire ſpurres. And therfore no man deſeruith to bee called a right courtier, onles hee bee fine and nete in his apparell hee weareth, &amp; alſo courteous and ciuill in his words and enterteinment. And yet touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of the furniture of their horſe, or gelding, their harnes and trappers muſt bee kept black and cleane, and they muſt looke that the reynes of the bridel bee not broken nor vnſowed, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I ſpeake not without cauſe: for there are a nomber of courtiers that at primero will not ſtick to ſet vp a ieſt of a .100. or .200. crownes, &amp; yet will think much to geeue their poore horſkeepers twelue pence to by them a payr of raynes. And truly the courtier (in my iudgement) that is content to tye his hoſe with vntagged poynts, to ſee his fier ſmoke whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee ſhould warme him, to ride with broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reynes, and to cut his meat at the table with a ruſty knife, I would think him baſe borne, and rudely brought vp. When the courtier will ryde his horſe, let him looke euer beefore hee take his back, that hee haue all his furniture fyt for him, his mayne and taile fynely comed, his ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops bright gliſtering, his ſtirrop leathers ſtronge, and his ſadell well ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, &amp; aboue all let him ſitt vpright in his ſeate, and cary his boddy euen, ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of nether ſyde, holding his legges ſtill and keepe his ſtirrope. For this name to bee called <hi>Chiuallier</hi> (ſignifieth in our tongue a rider of a horſe) came firſt beecauſe hee could ride and manedge his horſe wel, And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee would ſturre his legges to ſpurre his horſe, let him beeware hee ſtoupe not forwards with his boddy, and when hee dooth ſpurre his horſe, let him not ſpurre him low but hye in the flanckes, and whether hee will runne or ſtand ſtill with
<pb facs="tcp:21411:313"/>
his horſe, let him alwaies haue his eye vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raines, that in no caſe the raines, go out of his hand. And in geeuing his horſe a carere, let him not writh his body, nor bee to buſie in beating or ſpurring his horſe oft. For in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rire, to know when to ſpurre him, when to geeue him heade, or to pull him back againe, and to ſtoppe him, I haue ſeene many take yt vpon them, but fewe in deede that euer were ſkillfull and could do yt wel. Now the courtyer beeing mounted on horſe or moile, without his rapier by his ſyde, ſeemeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a phiſition that goth to viſite his ſick pacients, then a gentilman of the court that for his pleaſure and diſport rideth abrode through the ſtreates.</p>
                     <p>And if hee were by chaunce intreatid by ſome noble man to accompany him or to ride beehind him of pleaſure through the ſtreates, euery honeſt courtier ought not only to doo it, but vnaſked to bee ready to offer him ſelfe to wayte vpon him and go with him willingly. And let the fyne courtier beeware, that in geeuing his hand to a gentilwoman hee bee not gloued, and if ſhee be a horſback, that hee talke with her bare headed, to doo her the more honor, and if ſhee ryde beehind him, and they chaunce to diſcourſe togethers, let him neuer looke back vpon her to beehold her, for that is a rude maner and a token of ill education. And one comon courteſy there is amonge cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyers, that when they are in talke with ladyes and gentilwomen and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining of them, they ſuffer them to doo with them what they will, to reigne ouer them, and to bee ouercomed in argument of them, and they holde yt good maner to doo them ſeruice, when they haue any occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offered to ſerue them. And when hee ſhall accompany any gentylwoman to go a viſitation with her, or to walke abrode for their pleaſure through the ſtreates, hee muſt ryde fayr and ſoftly, and if ſhee ſhould happen to keepe him ſo long in talke till ſhee ſhould light, the good courtier muſt beare yt courteouſly, and make a good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance as though it greeued him nothing, ſyth wee know very wel, that when women beeginne once to talke, it is impoſſible for them to make an ende, onles they bee ouertaken with night, or preuented by ſome other accident. Hee that wilbee a courtier, muſt weare his ſhooes black and cleane, his hoſe ſtraight to his legges, and his garments without plight or wrincle, his ſworde fayr varniſhed, his ſherts fynely wrought, and his capp ſtanding with a good grace. For the chefeſt thing of court is, that noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bee rich in apparell, and the right courtyers fyne and cleanly. It is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for a man to weare his ſlippers ſo long that the corke bee ſeene, nor his garments till they bee torne, nor furre til yt bee bare beefore, nor ſhertes till they bee worne out, nor his cappe till the turffe bee greaſy, nor his coate till yt bee threde bare, nor his girdell till yt bee halfe broken. For the courtier may not only weare his garments to content himſelf, but alſo to like others that ſhall beehold yt. And after that hee is once determined to go to the court, hee muſt ſuppoſe to go thither well apparrelled, els they will not ſuer account him to bee a right courtier. For in this caſe, excuſe of pouerty may not bee alledged, for they will think them rather miſerable, then poore cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers. The good courtier may not ſpare in court, to ſpend afterwards at home: but hee muſt pinche at home to bee liberall afterwards in the court.</p>
                     <p>And yet once agayne I retorne to recite, that for a courtier to come into the princes fauor, hee may not any waye bee ſparing or miſerable, but rather ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21411:313"/>
liberall, and bountiful. For ſeeldome tymes concurre theſe two things together, to bee myſerable, and yet with his myſery to attayne to the princes fauor. I remember I ſaw a frend of myne once in the court were a ierkin faced at the coller with martyrns, and they were all bare and greaſy, and there was a certaine portugall in the court (a pleaſant compaignion) that came to this gentleman, and aſked him properly, what fayr Furrs they were hee ware about his neck: and this gentillman auſwered him martirns: marterns ſyr ſayth the portingall, mee thinkes they are rather like furrs of Aſhwedneſday, then of Shrouetewſday. And finely this portingall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>Mardi</hi> (that is tewſday) to his martrin ſurrs: &amp; ſo likewiſe his martrin furres to <hi>Mardi.</hi> And ſure hee had great reaſon not to prayſe them, but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rebuke him for them. For it had been more for his honor and worſhipp, to haue had the coller of his ierking lined with fayr new white lamine, then with thoſe old, ſtale, durty and ſwety marterns. The brooches that our courtier muſt were in his capp muſt bee very rich, and excelently wrought, and his deuiſe or woord that hee will haue about yt ſuch, that though euery man may reade yt, yet few ſhall vnderſtand what yt meanes. For ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes are euer lightly grounded of vaine and fond toyes, and therfor they ſhould bee ſomuch more ſecret and obſcure. For ſuer the fault is great y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in a man to deuiſeyt, though hee doo not beewray yt. Alſo his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants that waites vpon him muſt needes go handſomly apparelled, &amp; ſyne &amp; nete in their apparell. For it is ſmall honor for the maſter to bee well appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellyd, if hee let his ſeruants goe beggerly. There are many courtiers that haue their men following on them with threede bare clokes, torne coates, foule ſhertes, broken hoſe, and rent ſhoos. So that theſe poore ſeruing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or one moneth they were that their maſter giueth them, for three other moneths after they were their owne proper fleſh. It is no wiſe mans part, but a mere folly to keepe a greater traine then hee is able. For that courtier that hath alwayes many ſeruants wayting on him, and they going tottered and torne, hauing no good thing to put on their backs, (or at leaſt that they haue is but meane and ſimple) ſhal ſoner wynne the name of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, that prefarreth other men to ſaruice, then of a maſter that keepeth ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants him ſelfe. The good courtier muſt geeue vnto all his ſeruants that ſerue him, ether apparell, or wages: for that ſeruant that ſerueth only in houſe for bare meate and drink, ſhall neuer ſerue truly while hee dooth ſerue. And therfor let the courtier looke well to yt, that hee enterteigne no man into his ſaruice, but that firſt hee agree with bim for ſtanding wages: onles yt bee that hee bee ſome neuew, or kynſman, or ſome of his deare frends: els in the end, if hee bee a noble man (vnles hee doo ſo) hee ſhall find that at the yeares end hee ſhall ſpend him more, than if hee gaue him ordinary wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and beeſids they will not bee contented with him, although yt bee to his greater charge. Alſo let him conſider well, if yt happen that (when hee hath neede of ſeruants to wayre vpon him) ſome brother or neighbors chyld bee offerid to hym, whether hee ſhall receyue him or no. For after hee hath him in his houſe, ether hee ſhallbee compelled to beare with his faults, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders hee ſhall doo, or els deſirous to rebuke and reforme him, or to ſend him home againe, hee ſhall but winne anger and diſpleaſure of his father, or his
<pb facs="tcp:21411:314"/>
proper kinſfolks. Suerly ſuch courtiers as take thoſe kynd of men into their ſeruice, haue a greate deale of payne and troble with them. And truly it is too great a cruelty, that the courtier ſhould bee driuen to beare the diſhoneſty of his man y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſerues hym, when his owne father could not away with his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Some fathers there are ſo blinded, and ſotted with fatherly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and difficulte beſids to pleaſe, that they are not contented that the courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath receyued their ſonne into his ſaruice, and that hee entreate him as if hee were his owne kynſman: but further they would haue the courtier hys maſter beare withall his diſhoneſty and lewdnes: and if they ran not frame the yong man to theyr mynd as they would haue them, yet at leſt they would haue his maſter to pity him, for that hee is but yong and hath no knowledge, and for a while to winck at all his faults, in hope of a better amendment.</p>
                     <p>The courtier may not only ſee that his men bee well in apparell, but hee muſt prouyde alſo that they haue meate enough to put in their bellyes. For the ſeruants that are ſtarued for meate, are wont to doo ſmall ſeruice, and beſyds that to complayne much. Let him beware alſo hee doo not take into his ſaruice any leud perſones buſy bodyes, and vnquiet men, cutpurſes, Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians, quarellers or hooremongers: if hee find that hee haue any ſuch in his houſe, let him turne him out of ſaruice ſtraight: for by keeping ſuch mates in his houſe, his houſe ſhall neuer bee well ordered, there ſhall euer bee quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſwering amongſt them, and beſyds that, the neighbors and comon people ſhallbee offended. Let the good courtier forſee that hee haue no cards nor dyce in his houſe to occupy the ſeruants. For theſe thriftles ſeruants that are geeuen to play, beginne firſt to play, and afterwards they learne to ſteale. Let the courtier bee well aduiſed alſo whan hee chideth with hys ſeruants that hee bee not too loude; that his voyce may bee hard abrode, as all the hoſtes and Inkeepers are. For in beeing too loud hee ſhould bee more diſhonored, then blamed, for the ill words hee geeueth his man. Let him take heede alſo that hee doo not call his ſeruants dronkards, theeues, villeins, Iewes, nor other ſuch like names of reproche. For theſe and ſuch other like vncourteus woords are of ſmall correction, and yet they brynge diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and diſdaigne enough. And if the courtier can not geeue bountifully, and pleaſure his officers and ſeruants that are about him, yet at leaſt (how ſo euer the world go) let hym not bee behynd with them in paiyng them theyr whole wages due to them: for ſo yt myght lyghtly happen, that the ſeruants would beginne to make complaynts of hym, and that vnhappe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the end hee myght come to dy with myſery in his enemyes hands.</p>
                     <p>There is no enemy in the world ſo cruell, nor ſo much to bee feared, as the ſeruant that is not contented with his mayſter, for as hee is the theefe of the houſe, ſo knoweth hee very well what peece of his maſters harnes is wanting for his boddy to ſet on hym, whan hee would in that place haue an arrow for his token. Therfor ſoon ſoe as yt cometh to the courtyers eares that any of his ſeruants complaigne of hym, ether let him geeue hym all that hee would haue, or put hym out of his houſe imediatly. For if hee doo yt not, let him bee aſſured that that ſeruant will neuer leaue till hee haue him put in diſcorde with his frends, and defame with others. And aboue all things

wee haue ſpoken of yet, the courtier muſt cheefly looke what his man is hee truſteth with his honor: for in this caſe many are wont not only to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, but alſo many tymes ſcorned. And there are many that will put theyr goods into the hands and truſt of a man, but their honor, and things of gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt waight and importance, they will ſoner commit to the truſt of a yong fooliſh, and ſymple page, then of a wiſe and ſtaied man. And therfore how much more his buſines is of weight and importance, ſomuch leſſe ſhould yt bee reueled to the ſecrecy of a boy. And if hee doo otherwiſe, I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him hee ſhall ſoner bee ſpoken of of euery man, then hee ſhall haue his buyſines diſpatched. The courtier muſt alſo haue his chamber well han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and fynely kept, and cleane, and his houſe and famyly all in good order, and euery man quiet. For the cleanes of the houſe, and ciuility of the ſeruants, are a great token and witnes of the nobility of the maſter. In the courty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers chamber wheare hee lyeth, the bed muſt fyrſt of all bee made, and the cloth before the doore let down, the chamber ſwept, the hangings and other ſtuffe that is there in good order, with ſome parfumes or other ſweete o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, ſo that it ſhould laugh vpon a man that comes into yt: for there are ſome in the court ſo filthy and ſo il furniſhed of hangings and other ſtuff, that if any man come to ſee theyr chambers, they ſeeme rather ſheepe coates, then courtiers chambers.</p>

For many tymes the requeſts of the beelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in court are with more celerity performed, then the comiſſions of the prince are accompliſhed. Let the courtier alwayes haue in his mynde alſo, that if hee meete with any nobleman or Knyght by the way, hee doo in any condition retorne with him, and keepe him compaigny, although the nobleman or Knight ſtryue with him, not to haue him goe back with him, yet let him not ſuffer him ſelf to bee ouercome, to let all men know, that notwithſtanding the noble man or Knight paſſe him in degree or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, yet hee ſhall not exceede him in curteſy and ciuility. This compaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is to bee vnderſtanded to bee offered the knyght when hee rydeth in to the city of pleaſure, and not wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee goth alone, and ſhoweth by his forehead an vnpleaſant countenance trobled in his mynd. Yet the courtyer neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe muſt offer him ſelfe to accompaigne him, which if hee doo accept, hee may not then importune or withſtand him to doo yt: For wheare hee ſhould think to bee accounted courteous, they would repute him a trobleſom man. Whan the courtier ſhall accompaigny any noble man of the court, let him not then ſeme to contend with other courtiers for place, and honor in his preſence, who ſhould bee before, or behynd an other. For this ſtrife co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng to the noble mans eares whome they accompaginy, it myght eaſely happen, that that compaigne, that came to wayte vpon him, and to doo hym honor and ſeruice, ſhould then ſeeme to diſhonor and offend hym. Lytel kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth hee what honor meaneth, when in theſe trifles hee ſeeketh it. For the wiſe and curteous courtier, hath not only to ſeeke honor with them, with whome hee rydeth cheeke by cheeke: but alſo with thoſe that are beeloued of the prince. Now when the noble man is accompaignyed and that hee is come hard by the court, you courtyers, bee ready to lyght of your horſe quickly before him, and when hee ſhall lykewiſe take his horſe agayne, bee as redy to take your horſe back before him. For dooing thus, you ſhalbee nere about hym when hee lighteth of on his horſe, and afterwards help him when hee mounteth on his horſe againe. If perhapps at the comyng in of a chamber, the lords ſeruants want conſideration, or that they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not to hold open the cloth ouer the doore, the good and dilygent courtyer ſhould ſodenly put hym ſelfe beefore hym, to lyft and holde yt vp. For many tymes yt is as great an honor for a courtier to bee accounted one of good maner and bringing vp in the court, as out of the court it is to bee reputed a great and famous captaine in warres. And ſeence the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier is determined to accompaigne ſome noble man to the court, hee is alſo bounde by the lawes of the court to wayte vpon hym home agayne, which if hee doo, the noble man ſhalbee more beeholding to him for the attendance hee hath geeuen vpon him, then for his compaigne to ryde with hym. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:21411:315"/>
came to ſpeake with the courtier that were equall with him in degree or meaner of calling or condition then him ſelfe, yt is one of the firſt and chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt poynts of ciuility and good maner, not to ſuffer him to open his lippes to ſpeake to him, beefore hee haue his cappe on his head, for one to talke comon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly with the other with his cappe in his hand, is of great autority and reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as from the duty of the ſubiect to the prince, or that of the ſeruant to the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The good courtier muſt euer ſpeake agayne to him that ſpeaketh to him, doo him reuerence that dooth him reuerens, put of his cappe to him that putteth of his, and this hee muſt doo without any reſpect that hee is his frend or foe. For in the effects of good maner, no man ought to bee ſo much an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, that the enmity ſhould breake the boundes of curteſy and humanity. It is rather fyt for comon perſons, then for courtlike gentlemen, in ſo mean things to ſhow their e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitt. For to ſay truly, the good courtier ſhould not ſhow the enmity of his hart, by putting on or pulling of his cappe, but by takyng ſworde in hand to reuenge his quarel. And yf the courtier were in the church, court, or in the chappell of the prince, and ſet, and an other gentilman hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely cometh in the ſame place wheare hee is, hee muſt doo him the curteſy to geeue him his place and ſeate &amp; to pray him to ſit downe, yea and if there were no other place fyt for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gentilma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſit in, and that of courteſy alſo hee would not offer him that iniury to accept yt: yet at the leaſt let the courtier doo what hee may to make him take a peece of his ſtoole, that parting with him his ſeate, the other may alſo come to part with him his hart. If thoſe that were ſett hard by the courtier beegonne to talke in ſecret togethers, hee ſhould ryſe from thence, or go a litell aſyde from them. For in the court they will ſay hee is ill taught and brought vp, and wanteth ciuility and good maners that will ſeeme to harken to any bodyes tale or ſecrets. The courtiers muſt haue frendſhipp alſo with the porters to open him the court gates that are kept faſt cheyned in, that they bee contented to ſuffer theyr moyle or foote cloth nagge to enter into the vtter court. And the like muſt bee practiſed with the gentlemen vſſhers of the chamber, and captaine of the garde, to whome hee muſt doo a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pleaſures that they may reſpect his perſon, &amp; let him come in whan hee will. And the next way to wynne this frendſhipp, and to conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them frends and to bee welcome of them, is to feaſte them otherwhile, ſometyme with a dinner, ſome tyme with a bancket, but eſpecially not to ſaile them of a new yeares gift on neweyears day, what trifle or preſent ſo euer it bee. That courtier that is not acquainted with the vſſhers, and dooth them no pleaſures, may bee well aſſured that thoſe aboue in the hall, will make hym tarry in the vtter courte: and thoſe that ſtand at the gate of the cheyne, they wil make him light in the myer. With the vſſhers of the priuy chamber, he muſt needes deale honorably withall as to come and ſee them ſomtymes, and to doo them much honor, in giuyng them ſome fayre iewell or preſentyng them with a gowne or coate cloath of ſilke or veluet. And thus hee ſhallbee aſſured they will not only let him into the priuy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but they will alſo procure hym to ſpeake with the prince euen at his beſt leyſure. To make the yemen of the garde alſo that maketh gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men geeue place, and ſtand alofe of from the prince, yet can not bee but
<pb facs="tcp:21411:316"/>
very profitable for the courtier to haue them his frends. For many tymes they may helpe vs to a fit place to talke with the Kyng. yt is ſuch a troble and charge to get to ſpeake with the prince, that if wee haue not great frendſhipp with theſe wee haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, and that wee doo them ſome pleaſures beefore wee come to the court, they will ſhut the doores againſt vs, &amp; wee ſhall come home aſhamed of our ſelues. For a courtier to bee acquainted with the ladies and gentlemen of the court, it is rather of pleaſure then of neceſſity, albeeit it bee true, that the yonge courtier that ſerueth not ſome lady or dame in court ſhalbee rather blamed of his ſhamefaſtnes and cowardly hart, then approued for his modeſty and grauity. In deede for a yong gentilman that is rich, noble, and free harted, it is an honeſt and comly enterteinment to bee come ſome ladies ſeruant of the court: But for him that is poore, lyuing in diſgrace, and out of fauor, let him vtterly fly the loue of courtly dames, and ſlick to the poore frendſhippe of deuout nonnes. For the property of courtly myſtreſſes is to empty their ſeruants purſes, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner of religious nonnes to begge alwaies of him that viſites her. The courtier that offerith him ſelfe to ſerue any lady a or gentilwoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in court dooth bynd him ſelf to a ſtraight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: For ſome tymes hee muſt kneele by her of one knee, ſometimes hee muſt ſtand vpon his feete beefore her, and alwayes hee muſt haue his cappe in his hand, and hee may not ſpeake to her vnles ſhee commaund him fyrſt, and if ſhee aſke any thing of him, hee is bound to geeue yt her ſtraight if hee can, and though ſhee frowne vpon him, yet hee may not bee angry with her, ſo that the courtier muſt needes imploy his hole perſon, and goods, in ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing of her that hee loues. For the courtier that is maried, ſure it is not fyt for him to loue any other woman then his wife, nether is it honeſt for the woman to bee ſeruid with any maried courtier. For theſe maner of loues are to no other end, but for him to bee mery with her, and for her to get ſomwhat of him. Let the courtier bee very wiſe that hee doo not loue &amp; ſerue ſuch a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til woman, whom hee can not obtaine to his wife, for otherwiſe it ſhould bee a great greefe to him, and a more ſhame, to ſee an other beefore his eyes enioy her and eate of that frute, which hee had to his great coſt and charges made now a frutefull orchard. And if it happen that his miſtreſſe whome hee ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth bee nobly borne, very fayr of complection, pleaſant of condicion, of good grace and beehauiour in her conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, very wyſe and fyne in her dooings: hee may bee well aſſured hee ſhall neuer forget this greefe and ſorrow, and ſomuch more if hee did loue her withall his hart and vnfaynedly. There is great difference beetwene that wee loſe, and that wee haue: For if the hart la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment for the loſſe of that wee haue: yt beewayleth bitterly to loſe that wee loue. Alſo the courtier muſt bee aduiſed that hee tel not to any that his wife hath tolde him, or any thing that hath paſſed ſecretly beetweene them: For women are of ſuch a quality, that for any thing they doo, they would neuer heare of yt agayne willingly, and thoſe ſecrets that an other comits to them of truſt, they can neuer keepe them ſecret. There is a lawe comon beetwen women and their louers: For if they go abrode, theyr louers muſt attend vpon their perſons: and if they buy any thing in the ſtreate as they go, they are bound to pay for yt: And if they bee to late abrode, they muſt prouyde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <pb n="133" facs="tcp:21411:316"/>
of torches to bring them home with, and whan the court remoueth from place to place, theyrs is the chardge to defraud their expences by the way: and if any doo them iniury, they are bound to reuenge their quarell: yf they fall ſyck, they muſt doo them a thouſand pleaſures and ſaruices: yf any challenge bee made in court of tilt, torney, or barriers, they muſt bee the firſt and beſt mounted and armed aboue others (if they may poſſible) withall not forgetting their Ladies colours and deuiſe, offering them ſelues nobly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the challenge, geeuing them to vnderſtand, that for their ſakes, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare to aduenture theyr lyues, nor ſpare for any chardge to doo them all honor and ſeruice. With out dout wee may ſpeake yt truly, that hee put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him ſelfe to great perill and danger (what ſo euer hee bee) that ſerueth women. But when the wiſe courtier is now become a ſeruant to any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in court, hee muſt beware in any caſe he enterteigne or ſerue any other then his miſtreſſe: For if hee did otherwiſe, hee ſhould rayſe a mortall hate and diſcorde betweene thoſe women: by reſon wherof many ſclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and broyles might enſue. It is a naturall thyng to all women, that to hate any man, a hundred will come to agree in one opinyon: but to loue him you ſhall not find two of one mynde. The good courtier muſt couet the beſt hee can to bee alwayes at the making redy of the Kyng, and at his meate, and for two cauſes: The one for that hee may bee ready to doo him ſaruice, and the other, for that at ſuch a tyme they ſhall haue an apt tyme to treate with the prince in any thynge hee will, if hee haue any occaſion of buſines with hym. And when the king is ether at his meate, or that hee bee putting on his apparell, let the good courtier bee circumſpect hee come not to neere the table where hee ſitteth, nor that hee touch the kyngs apparell hee weareth on. For no man ought once preſume to bee ſo hardy to medle with his meate, or his apparell, vnles hee bee ſhewer, or chamberlayne.</p>
                     <p>And yf in this tyme of repaſt, or makyng him redy, there were preſent any ieſters or fooles, that ſayd or dyd any thing to make them laugh: The good courtier muſt take heede that hee laugh not to loude, as in ſuch caſes many are wont to doo. For in ſuch a caſe the prince would bee better ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at the modeſty of the courtier, then at the knauery or folly of the foole.</p>
                     <p>The honeſt courtier muſt not haue a foole his frend nor his enemy: for to make him his frend, hee is to diſhoneſt, and too bee his enemy, hee is to vile and cowardly. I wiſh the courtier not to bee angry with hym, what ſo euer hee dooth: for many times yt happeneth, that the frendſhipp of a wiſe man dooth not ſomuch benefit or pleaſure: as the enmity and diſpleaſure of one of theſe fooles dooth hurt. And if hee wyll geeue them any thyng (as hee muſt needes) let hym beeware hee geeue hym not occaſyon to condemne hys conſciens, and that hee ſtoppe theyr mouthes: For the courtier that is a chriſtyan, ſhould geeue aſmuch more to the poore to pray to god for hym, as hee ſhould geeue to others to ſpeake well of hym to the Kyng.</p>
                     <p>Whan the Kyng ſneyſes, and that the courtyer bee preſent, hee muſt ſtrayght put of his capp, and bowe hym ſelfe in maner to the ground,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:317"/>
but for all that hee muſt take heede hee ſay not chriſt helpe you, or god bleſſe you, or ſuch other lyke. For to do doo any maner of curteſy or honor, is only pertynent to courtiers: But to ſay chriſt helpe, or god bleſſe you, is the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try maner. And if the Kyng by chaunce ſhould haue any heare, or feather, or flee vpon his clothes, or any other filthy thynge about him: none but the chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lein only ſhould take it away, and none other courtier ſhould once preſume to take any thing from his back, or to touch his garment, nether any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, vnles it were in caſe to defend him. When the Kyng is ſet at the table, the courtier may not come into the kitchin, nor much leſſe leane vpon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueying boorde. For though hee did yt perhaps but to ſee the order of the ſuruey and ſeruice of the prince: yet yt may bee ſuſpected of ſome, hee ment ſome worſer matter, and therby they ſhould iudge ill of him. If the prince haue a felicity in hawking, the courtier muſt indeuor him ſelfe to keepe a caſt or two of good fawlcons: &amp; if in hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting, then hee muſt haue good greyhounds. And whan hee is eather a hawking or hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng, hee muſt ſeeke to ſerue him ſo diligently that day, that hee may both fynd him game to ſport with, and procure for him ſelfe alſo fauor at the princes hand. Many tymes princes are ſo earneſt of their game, and ſo deſirous to kill that they hunt, that they are wont boldly to chaſe the beaſts they hunt, and purſue them ſo, that oftymes they loſe the ſight of all the reſt. In ſuch a caſe the good cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier muſt euer haue his eyes vpon him, and rather ſeeke to follow the kyng, then to take pleaſure in hunting of other beaſtes. For in that caſe yt ſhall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee a better hunting for him, to fynd out the kyng, and to bee with him: then hee ſhould take pleaſure in beeing alone with the hart. Yt may happen light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Kyng gallopping his horſe vpon the rockye ſtones, hee might ſtumble at ſuch a ſtone, as both the kyng and his horſe ſhould come to the ground: and at that tyme it could not bee but very profitable for the courtier to bee preſent. For yt might ſo happen, that by meanes of the princes fal, (hee beeing redy to helpe him) hee might thenceforth beeginne to grow in fauor and credit with the prince. The moſt parte of thoſe that delyght to goe a hunting, are wont comonly to eate theyr meat greedely, and drinke out of meaſure, and beeſids to ſhoute and make a wonderfull noyſe as they were out of their wits: which things the graue and wiſe courtier ſhould not doo: for they are rather fit for vacabonds, and Idle perſons, that ſetteth not by their honeſty: then they are for the honeſt courtier, that only deſireth and indeuoureth by modeſt &amp; wiſe bee hauiour to beecome great, and in fauor.</p>

For in deede if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of theſe ſuters, were forced to abyde for his faith and beleeue thoſe pains, troubles, and ſorows, that hee dooth to recouer his goods: as much cruelty as tortures ſhoold <hi>Vagliadoti,</hi> and <hi>Grauata</hi> haue, as euer had Rome in times paſt. In my oppinion, I think it a hell to continue a long ſuter. And ſurely wee may beleeue, yea and ſwere to, that the martirs executed in old tyme in the primitiue church (which were many in nomber) did not ſuffer ſo much, neither felt ſuch grief to loſe their life, as dooth now a days an honeſt man to ſee him ſelf depriued of all his faculties. It is a great trouble and charge to recouer any thing, but in the end of theſe two effects, a wyſe man ſuffreth and feeleth more the diſpleaſures hee receiueth, then hee dooth the goods hee ſpendeth. And in my iudgement to ſtryue and contend is nothing els, but to bring matter to the hart to ſigh and lament, to the eyes to weepe, to the feete to goe, to the tongue to complain, to the hands to ſpend, to intreat his frends to fauor his cauſe, and to commaund his ſeruaunts to bee carefull and diligent, and his body to labor continually. Hee that vnderſtandeth not the condicions of contention I wil let him know they are theſe. Of a rych man, beecome poore: of a mery man, to bee made melancholy: of a free man, a bond man: of a liberall man, a couetous man: of a quiet man, an vnquyet perſon: and of a hatefull, a deſperat perſon. How is it otherwiſe poſſible, but the haples ſuter muſt beecome deſperate? ſeeing the iudge looke vppon hym with frowning cheere, his goods to bee demaunded of him wrongfully, and that now it is ſo long a tyme hee hath not beene at home, and knoweth not yet whether ſentence ſhalbee geeuen with him or againſt him, and beſydes all this, that the poore man in his lingring ſuite hath ſpent ſo much, that hee hath not left him ſix pence in his purſe. If any of theſe troubles bee enough to bring a man to his end, much more ſhal they bee to make the poore man deſperat, and wery of his lyfe. So dyuers are theffects, and ſucceſſe ſeene in matters of ſuite, that many tymes there is no witt able to direct them, nor goods to bring them to end. Nay wee may boldly &amp; truely ſay, that the laws are ſo many, and diffuſe of them ſelues, and mens iudgements ſo ſimple to vnderſtand them, that at this day there is no ſuite in the world ſo cleere, but there is found an other law to put that in doubt, and make it voyd. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore the good and yll of the ſuter, conſiſteth not ſo much in the reſon hee hath, as in the law which the Iudge chooſeth to geeue iudgement of. It is well that the ſuter beleeue and think that hee hath right, but the cheefeſt thing of importance is, that the iudge alſo deſire y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee haue his right. For that Iudge that fauoreth my cauſe, and deſyreth to doo mee iuſtice, hee will labor &amp; ſtudy to ſeeke out ſome law, that ſhal ſerue my turne to reſtore mee again to my right.

by ſtudying of dyuers bookes, nor by traueling through dyuers countreys, but only by framing great ſuites and proceſſes, and by infinite charge and expence of money. Happy, yea truely moſt happy were thoſe ages, in whych they neither knew, nor coold tell, what ſtrife or contentionment. For in deede from that tyme hetherto, the world hath fallen to decay, and cheefely ſince men haue growen to quarel and contend ech other with his neighbor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> was wont to ſay, that in that comon weale where there were found many Phiſitians, it was alſo an euydent token that there were many vicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people: and lykewiſe wee may ſay that in the city where there are many ſuters, it is to bee thought it folowes alſo, that there are many yll diſpoſed people. That only may bee called a bleſſed and fortunat common weale, where men lyue quietly, and haue not to doo with Iuſtices nor iudges. For it is a true rule, when phiſitians are much freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, and iudges much occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed, that amongſt that people there is lyttle health, and leſſe quiet. But to returne to the troubles of our ſuters, I ſay that the diſciples of the famous Philoſopher <hi>Socrates</hi> were not bound to bee ſylent in <hi>Athens</hi> aboue two yeres, but the vnfortunat ſuters were bound to hold their peace tenne yeres if their ſutes did continue ſo long. For albeeit the Iudge doo them open iniury, yet they may not ſeeme to complayn, but rather ſay hee thinketh hee hath doon him the beſt iuſtice in the world. And if for his miſhapp, or plague of his offences, hee woold not ſo approue and ſpeak them, let him bee aſſured the Iudge will perceiue it by his countenaunce, and afterwards lett hym know it by his iudgement. Some ſuters ſay they are great ſinners, and I ſay they are ſaints. For of the ſeuen dedly ſinnes that are committed, only of three they are but to bee accuſed. For in the other iiii. (although they woold) they doo not geeue him tyme nor leaue to offend. How can the ſuter euer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in Pryde, ſince hee muſt poore man goe from houſe to houſe with hys capp in his hand, and all humility to ſolicite his cauſe? How can hee euer of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in Auarice, ſyth hee hath not many tymes a peny in his purſe to by him his dyuer, nor to pay for the infinit draughts and coppyes proceeding out of the Chauncery? How can hee offend in Sloth and ydlenes, ſith hee conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the long nights only in ſighes and complaynts, and the whole day in trotting and trudging vp and down? How can hee offend in Gluttony ſince hee woold bee content to haue only to ſuffyſe nature, and not to deſyre pyes, nor breakfaſtes, nor to lay the table euery day? That ſinne they moſt eaſely and commonly offend in, is Ire, and in deede I neuer ſaw ſuter pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: and although hee bee angry, wee may not maruell at yt a whit. For if euer once in the end of half a yere hee happen to haue any thyng that pleaſeth hym, I dare bee bound euery weeke after hee ſhall not want infinit troubles to torment and vex hym. Theſe men alſo offend much in enuy, for in deed there is no man that pleades but ys enuious, and thys proceedeth many tymes to ſee an other man, by fauor diſpatched of hys ſute, that hath not contynu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only two moneths in court a ſuter: and of hys that hath continued aboue two yeres ſynce yt beganne, not a woord ſpoken. They offend alſo in the ſinne of backbyting, and murmuryng agaynſt their neyghbors. For they neuer ceaſe complayning of the partiality of the Iudges, of the ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes and tymorouſnes of his Counſeller, that pleades hys cauſe at the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21411:318"/>
barre: of the little conſideration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> attorny, of the payments of the notary, and of the ſmall curteſies (or rather rudenes) of the officers of the Iudge.</p>
                     <p>So that it may well bee ſayd, that to ſtriue in law, and to murmure, are nere kinſfolkes togeethers. The <hi>Egiptians</hi> were in tyme paſt plaged only wyth tenne plagues, but theſe miſerable &amp; woful ſuters are dayly plaged w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a thow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſand torments. And the difference beetwixt their plague &amp; theſe, is that the <hi>Egiptians</hi> came from the diuine prouydence, and theſe (of our poore ſuters) from the inuention of mans malyce. And it is not without cauſe wee ſay that it is mans inuention, &amp; not diuine. For to frame inditements, to geene delays to the party, to allege accions, to deny the demaund, to accept y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proofe, to examin witneſſes, to take out proces, to note the declaration, to prolong the cauſe, alleging well, or prouing yll, to refuſe the iudge for ſuſpect, to make interceſſion to take out the copy of the plea, and to call vppon it agayn wyth a 1500. dudles: Surely all theſe are things that neither god commaundeth in the old teſtament, neither Iheſus Chriſt our ſauiour dooth allow in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goſpell. The writings of <hi>Egipt,</hi> although they were to the great loſſe and detriment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeignory of the Egiptians, yet were they neuertheleſſe very profitable for the liberty of the Egiptians. But the miſerable playntifes are yet in an other greater extremity. for notwithſtanding the plagues and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries the poore wretches ſuffer daily, yet do they leaue their ſoules buried in the courts of Chauncery, and cannot notwithſtanding haue their goods at liberty. And if the plague of the <hi>Egiptians</hi> was by ryuers of blood, froggs, horſe flyes, death of cattell, tempeſts, leproſy, locuſts, miſts, flyes, and by the death of the firſt borne children: The plague of the plaintifes is to ſerue the preſidents to beare with the auditors, to intreat the notaries, to make much of their clarks, to pleaſe the counſellers, to follow their heeles that muſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their cauſe, to pray the vſſhers, to borow money, to goe from houſe to houſe to ſollicite their attorneys, all theſe things are eaſy to tell, but very hard to ſuffer: For after they are once prooued and tryed by experience, they are enough to make a wyſe man contented, rather to loſe a peece of hys ryght, then to ſeeke to recouer it by any ſuch extremity. For hee may bee well aſſured, that hee ſhall neuer want fayre countenaunce, ſugred woords, and large promyſes: but for good dooings it is a maruelous woonder if euer they meete togeethers. And therefore beefore all other thyngs it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hee pray to God for hys own health and preſeruation, and next to him, for the preſeruacion and long continuaunce of the Iudge, if hee will obteyn his ſuite. Therefore I aduiſe him that hath not the Iudge for hys frend, to bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware (as from the deuyll) hee doo not commence any ſuite beefore him. For to diſpatch him the better, eyther hee will fynd the means to make his caſe very dark, or at leaſt hee will prolong his ſuite as long as it pleaſe. It ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not much whether the iudges bee old, or yong men, for both wyth the one and the other the poore playntife hath enough to doo. If they bee old men a man ſhall trauell long ere hee will heare his cauſe. If they bee yong men, hee ſhall wayt long alſo ere hee can informe them of the very poynts of his caſe. An other great diſcommodity yet foloweth theſe old Iudges, that beeing euer ſickly and of weak nature, they neuer haue ſtrength nor
<pb facs="tcp:21411:319"/>
tyme in maner to examyn their caſes. And as thoſe that haue loſt now a great peece of their memory, only truſting in forepaſſed expences, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to diſpatch their ſutes as lyghtly (without further looking into them, or throughly examining them) as if they had already aduiſedly ſtudyed them. And peraduenture their caſe is of ſuch importaunce, that if they had looked vppon it very well, they coold ſcantly haue told what to haue ſaid in it. And I woold not that when my caſe ſhoold bee determined, and iudgement gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vppon my matter, that the Iudge ſhoold benefit him ſelf only, with that hee had ſeene or read beefore. For although experience bee a great help for the Iudge, to geeue the better Iudgement vppon the matter, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hee is to ſtudy a new to vnderſtand the merits of the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>It is alſo a great trouble, and daungerous, for a man to practiſe wyth new Iudges, and to putt their matters into their hands, who only were called to the place of a Iudge, beeing thought learned and fitt for yt, and ſo brought to rule as a magiſtrate. For many tymes theſe yong Iudges, and new phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians although they want not poſſibly knowledge, yet they may lacke a great deal of practyſe and experience: which is cauſe that the one ſort ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth many loſe their lyues beefore they come to ryſe infame: and the other vndoo many a man, in making him ſpend all that euer hee hath.</p>
                     <p>There is yet beſydes an other apparaunt daunger, to haue to doo wyth theſe new and yong experienced iudges, for when they come to ſit newly in iudgement, with their other brethren the Iudges, hauyng the law in theyr mouth to ſerue all turnes, they doo but only deſire and ſtudy to wynne fame and reputation amongſt men, and thereby to bee the better reputed of hys brethren. And for this cauſe only when they are aſſembled together in place of iuſtyce to geeue iudgement of the plees layd beefore them, they doo then only enlarge them ſelues, in alleging many and dyuers oppinions of great learned men, and booke caſes: So that the heerers of them may rather think they haue ſtudyed to ſhew their eloquence and learning, then to open the deciſion and iudgement of the caſes they haue beefore them.</p>
                     <p>And for fynall reſolution I ſay, that touching plees and ſutes. I am of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, they ſhoold neyther truſt the experience of the old Iudge, nor the learnyng and knowledge of the yong. But rather I recken that man wyſe, that ſeeketh by lyttle and lyttle to grow to an honeſt end and agrement wyth hys aduerſary, and that taryeth not many yeares to haue a long, yea (and poſſible) an vncertain end. Alſo I woold exhort the poore pleyntyfe, not to bee ouer curious to vnderſtand the qualityes of the Iudge, as a man woold ſay. If hee bee old, or yong, yf hee bee learned or priuileged, yf hee bee well ſtudyed or but little, yf hee bee a man of few or many woords, yf hee bee affected or paſſioned, tractable or ſelf willed, for poſſibly beeyng to inquiſitiue to demaund of any of theſe thyngs, it myght happen though hee dyd it vnwarrs, yet hee ſhoold fynd them afterwards all heaped togeethers in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parſon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge, to hys hynderance &amp; damage in decydyng his cauſe. The wiſe ſuter ſhoold not only not ſeeke to bee inquiſitiue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudge or his condicions, but alſo if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> woold ſeme to tel him of him, hee ſhoold geeue
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21411:319"/>
no eare to him at all. For if it come to the iudges ears hee inquireth after his maner of lyuing, and condition, hee will not only bee angry with him in hys mynd, but wilbee alſo vnwillyng to geeue iudgement in his fauor. The poor ſuter ſhall alſo meete with terrible iudges, ſeuere, intractable, collerick, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable, and inexorable, and yet for all this hee may not looke vppon his nature, nor condicion, but only regard his good conſcience. For what neede hee care if the Iudge bee of ſeuere and ſharp condicion, as long as hee may bee aſſertained hee is of good conſcience. It is as needefull for the vpright, and good Iudge, to haue a good and pure conſcience: as it is to haue a ſkylfull head, and iudgement in the lawes. For if hee haue this without the other, hee may offend in mallyce: and if hee haue that without the other, hee may offend alſo in ygnoraunce. And if the ſuter come to ſpeak wyth the Iudge, and hee by chaunce fynd him a ſleepe, hee muſt tarry tyll hee awake, and yf then hee will not, or hee cannot geeue eare vnto him, hee muſt bee contented. And yf hee cauſed his man to ſay hee were not within (notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſuter ſaw him) hee muſt diſſemble yt, yea if the ſeruaunts geeue him an yll aunſwer, hee muſt take it in good woorthe: For the ware and politike ſuter muſt not bee offended at any thyng that is doon or ſayd to hym, tyll hee ſee the diffinitiue ſentence geeuen with him or againſt him.</p>
                     <p>It is a maruelous trouble alſo to the ſuter to chooſe his Counſeller. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes hee ſhall chooſe one that ſhall want both law and conſcience. And ſome others ſhall chooſe one that though on the one ſyde hee lack not law, yet on the other hee ſhalbee without both ſoule and conſcience. And this is apparantly ſeene, that ſometyme for the gayn of twenty nobles hee ſhall as willingly deny the troth, and goe againſt his own conſcience, as at an other tyme hee will ſeeke to mayntain Iuſtice. It is true there are many other counſellers alſo that are both wiſe and learned, and yet notwithſtandyng they know the law, they can by no means frame it to his clyents caſe, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting deuyſe and conueyaunce to ioyn them togeether. And ſo yt happeneth many tymes, that to compare it to his clyants caſe, hee conueyth him ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly, as of a playn caſe it was beefore, it is now made altogeether a fold of infinite doubts. I graunt it is a great furtheraunce to the clyants, to haue a good &amp; wiſe counſeller, but it is a great deale more for their profit, yf they can geeue a ſound and profound iudgement of his caſe. For yt is not enough for the counſeller to bee able to expound the law, but it is beehouefull for him to apply yt to hys purpoſe and to apt it to tyme and place, accordyng to the neceſſity of his cauſe. I haue knowen counſellers my ſelf, that in theyr cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and readyngs in their halles, haue ſeemed Egles, they haue flowen ſo hygh in their doctrin and interpretations: but afterwards at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barre where they plead, and in the face of the court, where they ſhoold beſt ſhew them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, there they haue prooued them ſelues very capons. And the only cauſe of this is, beecauſe they haue gotten by force of long trauell and continuall ſtudy, a knowledge to know to moote, and read ordinaryly their booke caſes in their chayers, by common practyſe, and putting of them ech to other.</p>
                     <p>But when they are taken out of that common trade and hygh beaten way, and brought to a lytle path way ſtrayghted to a counſellers roome at the
<pb facs="tcp:21411:320"/>
barre, to plead his clyants ſtraunge and vnknowen caſe (much contrary to their booke caſes beefore recyted) then ſtript of their common know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and eaſy ſeat in chayer, they ſtand now naked on their feete before the iudgement ſeat, lyke ſenceles creatures voyd of reaſon and experyence. But now to ſupply theſe imperfeccions of our raw counſellers, and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo our Clyents cauſe the better: wee will that the Clyent bee liberall, and bountifull to hys counſeller, (thereby the better to whet his wytt and to make him alſo take payns to ſtudy his caſe throughly) beeing true, that the counſeller geeueth law, as hee hath reward. And that the counſeller alſo bee carefull of hys Clyants cauſe, and to goe thorow wyth that hee taketh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, and truely to deſerue that hee taketh of euery man. For els they will ſay (and who can blame the poore ſoules) they are better takers, then good diſpatchers: A foule blott to ſo great a vertue. But well, wee will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them to their brothers the phiſitians, who deale with their ſick paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, as the lawiers with their poore clyants. For if you geeue him not a peece of gold or two in his hand, at ech tyme of his viſitation, to reſtore the languiſhing body: hee careth as lyttle for the preſeruation of his health, whether hee lyue or dye: as the lawier dooth for his claynts caſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it goe with him or againſt him. More ouer my penne ceaſeth not to wryte of the great troubles, diſpleaſures, iorneys, expenſes, and trauels, that the poore ſuters haue with their counſellers dayly (as with theyr atturneys, Soliciters, clarks, officers, regiſters, and ſealers) for want of matters to write on: but only for that they are ſo odious matters, and ſo foule examples, that they deſerue rather to bee remedied then written. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leauing this law diſcurſe, and returning agayn to the pryuate affaiers of the courtier, abyding ſtill in court, I ſay: That the courtier muſt learn to know the noble men and cheef officers of the Prince. As the lord chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, The lord Treaſorer, The lord marſhall, The lord Steward, The lord Chamberlain, The lord Priuy ſeal, The Treaſorer, The Controller, The maiſter of the horſe, The vice Chamberlayn, the Secretary, the captayn of the gard, and the Coferer. And hee need not force to wey their ſtock and family, whether they were ritch or poore, humble or proud, ſtout or fearfull, nor regard their qualities and complexions, much leſſe their perſons, ſaue only their aucthority and office they haue. And to ſay truely it cannot bee choſen, but wee muſt come before theſe Iudges and officers ſometymes to beſeech and pray them, now for our own priuat cauſes, then for the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule and offence of our ſeruaunts, and alſo for the importunancy of our fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in their matters, to labor them for iuſtice and fauor. And for this cauſe mee thinkes it is a wiſe part of the courtier to gett into fauor with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and other officers of Iuſtice, and to obtain their good willes with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall attendaunce of them, in dooing them ſeruyce at a neede, and alſo to entertayn them wythſome ſmall preſents to continue their fauour.</p>
                     <p>Fyrſt beefore wee beeginne to trouble them, wee muſt bee acquainted wyth them, vyſit them, and preſent them wyth ſomewhat: For indeede it ys a cold and vnfitt thyng to craue fauor at a Iudges hands, whom wee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer knew, nor dyd any ſeruyce to.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:21411:320"/>The wyſe courtyer muſt beeware alſo not to importune the noble men and his frends ſo much, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for euery tryflyng thyng hee woould haue them goe to the iudges, to ſolicite and intreat for hym, which I ſpeak, beecauſe I know there are ſome ſuch indiſcreat perſons, that dayly doo importune the iudges ſo much, and for ſuch trifles, that afterwards with ſhame they are repulſed, and denyed, in matters of great waight and importaunce. And there are ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me alſo that ſolicite their matter with grauity, and others with importunyty, to whom I wyllbee ſo bold to ſay, and tell them of it alſo, that importuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſheweth the ſimplicitie of the ſuter, and grauity, the honeſty of the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy knyghts &amp; gentleman courtier. It is but well doone and meete for the courtier that is a ſuter, to bee diligent to ſollicite his cauſe, and to follow yt thoroughly, but yet wythout troubling or importuning too oft the iudges. For if once the iudges know him for an importunate and cumberſome ſuter, they will not onely not ſpeak with him when hee comes, but alſo they will not let hym come in at the gate when they ſee him comming to them. And if hee happen to goe home to the iudges houſe, and that hee tell his tale to him ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, let him not in no wiſe care to ſyt down, and that hys woords hee ſpeak to hym bee few, and his memoriall hee geeues him breefe. For obſeruyng this order hee ſhall at that tyme bee eaſily, yea willingly and courteouſly hard of hym, and ſhall make him think that hereafter alſo hee will vſe the lyke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wyth hym. When hee ſeeth that the iudge is troubled, and that his head is occupyed, let him in no caſe at that preſent offer to trouble him, or to ſpeak to hym in his matter. For admit hee were contented to heare you quyetly (though half vnwillyng) and to ſuffer you to tell your tale, yet is it impoſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hee ſhould wholly vnderſtand your caſe, his head beeing otherwyſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed. And it is needefull alſo to ſhew you, that though the iudge ſeeme to bee a lytle melancony, or collerick, yet the ſuyter neede not let for that to ſpeak to him, to open hys caſe, yea and to ſeeke to hold in wyth hym ſtyll: For many tymes wee ſee the melancony and ill diſpoſed natures, appeaſed and ouercome with the courteous and gentle conuerſation. I remember touchyng this matter, I went once to the court, to ſolicite the iudge, to pray hym to diſpatch my frends matter, and that hee myght haue iuſtyce. And tooke my frend with mee. And the iudge aunſwered vs both, that withall hys hart hee would diſpatch hym, and ſware and ſware agayn to him that hee ſhould haue iuſtice, &amp; that with right good wyll hee woould keepe his right all hee could. Nay ſir ſayd my frend to him whom the caſe touched, I thank you ſyr very much that you will diſpatch mee quickly, but wheare you ſay that you haue a great deſire to keepe my right and iuſtice, I vtterly appeale from that ſentence. For I come not ſyr, and yf it pleaſe you, to folow your heeles and to wayte vpon you to ſolicite my cauſe, to the end you ſhould kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe my ryght, and deteigne yf from mee: but that you ſhoold geeue yt to mee. For I ꝓmis you this ſyr, if you once geeue it mee, I mean neuer to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your woorſhip hereafter w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the keeping of it agayn, but wil diſcharge you quite. And now after al theſe things we haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> who ſo euer curſeth his enemy, &amp; ſeeketh reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of an iniury doon him, let him not deſire

                     <p>THe courtier ſhall doo well and wyſely, (and cheefely if hee bee noble, &amp; beeloued to paſſe ouer the iniuries doone hym, and to beare them pacy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, &amp; neuer to geeue any woords to any that ſhall offend him. For the officers of princes can by no other means ſo well aſſuer their offices and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority they haue, as by dooyng good continually to ſome, and to ſuffer others, no way makyng any countenaunce of diſpleaſure for the iniuries doone hym by others. And yf yt happen (as many tymes yt dooth) that a folower and hanger on of the court, (hauyng ſpent all that hee hath, and dryuen now to ſeeke a new banck) chaunce to ſpeak dyſhoneſt woords, and frame great quarells againſt the kyngs officers: in thys caſe the courtier, and wiſe offy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, ſhould neuer aunſwer him wyth anger and diſpleaſure, and much leſſe ſpeak to hym in choller. For a man of honor, and reſpect, wyllbee more greeued wyth a diſhoneſt woord that is ſpoken agaynſt him, then hee wilbee for the denyall of that hee aſketh. Thoſe that are beeloued, and beelyked of prynces aboue all other thyngs ought to bee very pacient, courteous and gentle in all things. For all that the followers of the court, and ſuters, can not obteyn in the court, let them not lay the fault to the prince that denyed yt them, but onely to the fauored of the prince, and thoſe about him, for that they neuer mooued yt to the kyngs maieſty: nor once thought of the matter, as the poore ſuters ſuppoſed they had. The payns and troubles of court are infynyt and inſupportable. For how quyet ſo euer the courtier bee, they wyll trouble and moleſt him, if hee bee pacyent, they willbee impacyent and in ſtormes, ſaying that ſuch a man ſpake ill of hym, and ſeekes contynually to defame hym. Whych things wee wyll the courtyer heare wyth paciens, and diſſemble with wiſedome. For the wiſe courtyer ſhould not bee angry for the ill woords they ſpeak of hym, but onely for the vile and wycked actes they doo to hym. Let not the courtyer and beelyked of the prynce bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, in thynkyng that dooyng for this man, and for that man, and in ſhewyng them fauor: that for all hee can bynd or ſtay their tongues that they ſpeak not ill of hym, and their harts that they hate them not extreamly. For the enemy receyueth not ſo much pleaſure of that the courtyer geeueth hym, as hee dooth greef and dyſpleaſure, for that that is beehynd yet in the

Now in the pallace of prynces it is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall thyng, for eche man to deſire to aſpire, and to creepe into the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fauor, to bee able to doo much, and to bee more woorth then others, and to commaund alſo: and as there are many that deſire it, ſo are they very few in number that by their vertues and demeryts obteyn that fauor. It is a thing moſt ſuer and vndoubted, that one alone enioying his princes grace and fauor, ſhalbee hated in maner of the moſt part of the people. The more they bee rych, noble, and of great power, that are beeloued and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of princes, ſo much the more ought they to bee circumſpect, and to lyue in feare and doubt of ſuch diſgraces and myſfortunes that may happen to them, ſyth euery mans eye is vppon them, and that they are enuyed for that they can doo much, and deſire alſo to take from them that autority and credit they haue, and to ſpoyle them of ſuch treaſure as they poſſeſſe, or haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the princes fauor. And in this caſe the beelyked of the court muſt not truſt in the pleaſures hee hath doone them, neyther in the fauor hee hath ſhewed them, much leſſe in the fayned frendſhyp they ſeeme to beare hym, and that hee thinks hee hath gotten of them, neyther muſt hee muſt to much hys frends, neighbors, and kynſfolks, no nor hys own brethren: But let hym bee aſſured, that all thoſe that are not in lyke fauor and eſtimation that hee is, (bee hee of what degree or parentage hee willbee, yea and as neere a kynne as may bee) they wyll all bee in that his very mortall foes. Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryty to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund, beeyng the cheef and hygheſt poynt of honor, and whereto euery man ſeekes to aſpire, and whych was cauſe that <hi>Pompey</hi> beecame the deadly enemy of <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> hys father in law, <hi>Abſalon</hi> of <hi>Dauid</hi> hys naturall father, <hi>Romulus</hi> of his brother <hi>Remus, Allexander</hi> of <hi>Darius,</hi> who ſhewed hym ſelf to fore a father in loue in bryngyng on hym vp, and <hi>Marke Antony</hi> of <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar</hi> hys great frend. So that I ſay, yt may well bee ſayed, that after dyſdaigne and cankered Ire haue once poſſeſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycat breſt of man, onely concernyng honor and commaundement, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thencefoorth recured of that infeſted ſore, neyther by gyfts and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and much leſſe by prayers and requeſts. It is true the accepted of the prynce may well bee free from all thirſt and hunger, colde and heet, warres, plague, and pouerty, and from all other calamytyes and troubles of thys our wretched lyfe, but hee ſhall neuer bee free from detractions of venemous and wycked tongues, and from ſpyghtfull and enuyous perſons. For no leſſe ys enuy ioyned to fauor, then is thirſt to a burnyng ague. In this caſe yt is impoſſible but that the courtier ſhould receyue many tymes diſpleaſure and diſgraces in the court, but not to geeue eare to theſe detracters, and yll ſpeakers of men. To remedy theſe things, the courtier muſt needes ſeeme to let them know by hys lookes and aunſwers, that hee is more offended w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them, that come &amp; tell him theſe lewd tales: then w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe that indeede did truely report the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hym. This cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell would I geeue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courtier, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what ill ſo euer hee heareth ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him, I woold wiſh him not ſeeme to know it, &amp; much leſſe to be a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gry w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al, nor once to geue a diſhoneſt woord to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reporters therof. For his choller ouer paſt, the euel woords hee hath ſpoken to them in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may tourn hym to more diſpleaſure, then hee hath doone him hurt that
<pb facs="tcp:21411:322"/>
cauſed him ſpeak theſe woords. And therefore ſurely to bridel the tongue, is rather a diuine then humayn vertue: and cheefely in that inſtant, when the hart, is maſtered and ſubdued with cholorick paſſions. For afterwards yt happeneth many times, that beeing quyet agayn in our mynds, wee are ſory for that wee haue ſpoken in our anger, yea agaynſt them that haue angred vs. If the courtier ſhould way euery woord that is ſpoken agaynſt him, and eſteeme euery thing that is doon to him, hee ſhould purchace him ſelf a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall and ſorowfull life, yea and out of meaſure a trobleſome and vnpleaſant, ſyth princes courts are euer full of ſerpent tongues, and venomous harts, and that it lyeth not in mans power to let, that the harts of men hate vs not, and that their tongues ſpeak not ill of vs, I would aduiſe the courtier to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke all the ill that is ſpoken of him, in ſport and myrth, and not in anger. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> ſayd (and that wyſely ſpoken) that there is no greater reuenge to puniſh an iniurious woord, then to ſeeme to laugh at yt. For it is a thing more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and proper to weomen, then men to deſire to take reuenge of woords, wyth the lyke woords agayn: ſyth the noble hart that eſteeme hys honor, muſt not haue his hands in his tongue, but his tongue in his hands. O how many haue wee ſeen, both out of court and in court, the w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> for no other reſpect but to reuenge one onely ſeely woord, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> touched them not much, would put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, their goods, and fame in perill: and yet in the end had not that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge neyther they deſyred, but rather redoubled it gaynſt them ſelues, in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng their fond and vayn attempt. Therefore to conclude thoſe that wylbee great in fauor and eſtimacion in the prynces court, and thoſe alſo that are now in fauor and credit with the prynce, and that deſire to contynue and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer in his fauor ſtill, muſt not make account of any woords ſpoken to hym, or offences doone hym: for all that are in fauor haue neede to ſuffer, and no occaſion to reuenge. Tyll this preſent day I neuer ſaw any that receyued any hurt or detriment by beeing pacient: but beeyng impacient I haue ſeene numbers caſt them ſelues away, you muſt alſo know, that in all places, wheare troupe and company of people bee, there is always euer diſcord and diuerſities in oppynions and iudgements of men. So that it happeneth many tymes in a common weale, yea and yt meeteth ſometimes in one hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, that all ſhallbee of one blood and kynred, yet in pryuat willes and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions mortall enemies. And therefore, ſuer yt is a thing woorthy to bee noted, and no leſſe to be wondered at, to ſee the father with the ſonnes, the vncles with the neuews, the graundfathers with the children, the ſonne in lawes with their father in lawes, and brothers with their brothers, and ſyſters, the one to bee as farre different from the other as white and black, and as much frends as the dogge and the catte. And all this is cauſed onely, for that they are rather wedded to a ſelf wyll and oppinion they haue, then they are addicted to loue and affect that that nature byndeth them to. Wee ſee alſo many yong courtiers, that though they bee vertuous and noble (hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited and ſucceeded in nobility of blood their aunceſtors) by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are honored and reuerenced: and poſſeſſyng alſo the greatnes, and aboundaunce of their goods, and ryches (whych makes them wealthy, and mayntayns them honorably) enioying the noble parentage for whych they
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:21411:322"/>
are regarded, hauyng many frends and ſeruaunts that doo them great ſeruyce and pleaſure. And all in reſpect of their noble auncetors: and yet notwithſtanding all theſe great thyngs wee haue ſpoken, they follow their own inuentions and imaginations, which their auncetors knowing would haue fled: and hate and myſlyke that, that they doubtles beeing alyue woold haue followed. And therefore it is rather a token of lightneſſe then of good wyll, for one to leaue to help and releeue his own frends and kynſfolks, to ſuccour and doo good to ſtraungers, or others, whom hee neuer knew, nor can tell what they are. For I aſſure you, that one of the greatſt loſſes and myſhaps that can come to a noble houſe, is to haue new frendſhyp, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialyty, with ſtraungers and men vnknowen. That gentelman that gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him ſelf to follow ſuch one as pleaſeth hys fantaſy beſt, and that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to lean to thoſe whom hys aunceſtors heretofore both loued and lyked: ſhall ſee thoſe old frends not onely leaue and forſake hym, but clean geeue hym ouer to hys wyll, and ſhortly after ſhall fynd his ſubſtaunce and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſume and waſt away, beeſydes, the honor of hys houſe to bee brought to vtter decay and oblyuion. And this wee haue ſpoken, onely to aduiſe the prynces officers, and ſuch as haue credyt and aucthority, that they doo not wyth fauor ſupport and ayd any partiall ſect, namely that that concerneth the ſtate and body of common weale. For the eſteemed of the prince, more eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with leſſe occaſion doo vndoe them ſelues, and loſe the credyt they haue woone: by reaſon of their partialities, and factions they mayntayn, then they doo for the dayly benefyts and ſuyts they importune the prince in. Wherefore the ſeruaunts and officers of the kyngs houſe, although they bee in good fauor with the prince, and that it pleaſe him to lyke well of them, yet they may not ſo hardyly ſupport any to doo hurt to others, and ſo abſolutly, as if they were the lords and princes them ſelues. For albeeyt yt pleaſeth the kyng to call them to honor, and to enrych them with goods and poſſeſſyons, yet the kyng can not, nor wyll not lyke that they ſhallbee ſuborners of fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and quarells, amongſt their ſubiects in the common wealth. And yet neuertheleſſe it happeneth many tymes, that thoſe that ſee them ſelues one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in fauor aboue others, will preſume to doo vyolence and wrong to others, truſtyng to their great credyt and fauor they are in, that that ſhall ſuffice to cloke and hide any fault they ſhall commyt, which they neuer ought to think nor yet for any reſpect in the world to doo. For ſuch vnhaply myght bee the cryme they commyt, that although it bee in the prynces power to doo great thyngs for them, yet hee could not at that tyme with his honor excuſe their offence, nor ſeeme to protect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their lewdnes, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out great murmur and diſcontentacion of his ſubiects. I know very well, that in court the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, affections, and oppynions of courtiers are ſo dyuers, and va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iable, that notwithſtandyng the beloued of the prynce endeuor hym ſelf al hee can poſſible to pleaſe &amp; content euery man in court, yet of all impoſſibylities it is a thyng moſt impoſſyble euer to attayn to it, to wynne all mens good wylles. Neuertheleſſe hee muſt ſo trimly and wiſely beehaue hym ſelf in all his doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that thoſe at leaſt, whom hee can not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all his pollicy &amp; deuiſe make his frends haue not yet any iuſt occaſion geeuen them to bee his enemyes. I ſee there is no mean, no reaſon, no deuiſe or pollycy of man, fauor nor dilygence,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:323"/>
that can defend the honored and eſteemed of court from detraction and enuy. Therefore I will boldly geeue him thys aduiſe with him that in matters of iuſtice and other publike affaires hee beare him ſelf ſo vpright, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they repine at his autority and credit: yet that they haue no cauſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to complayn of him. The courtier is forced to complayn when his own familiar companions and fellow ſeruants of the prince, in his matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or quarell ſtep beetween them, not to part them, but rather to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to contend with them and ioyne in demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of that they ſtriue for: which the lucles courtier is very apt to know, although hee dare not diſcouer yt, For many times hee ſuppoſeth yt leſſe euill to ſuffer the perſecucion of the enemy, then to fall into the diſgrace of the beeloued and eſteemed about the prince. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reputed of the prince co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly think they doo much for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale in bearing and fauoring ſome, and in puniſhing and perſecuting others. For thoſe of great autority, profeſſing honor and reputacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that feare ſhame: would rather them ſelues to bee defamed and reiected, then to ſee their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies aduaunced, or preferred to the fauor of the prince or of them that bee in fauor and credit with the prince. And the beeliked or officers of the prince may not think, that the fauor they geeue to one againſt an other, can be kept ſecret, and that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not come to light: for in ſo dooing they are deceyued. For in deede there is no thing ſo manyfeſt or knowen in the common weale, then the doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and practiſes of thoſe that are in fauor and autority, yea euen to the very woords they ſpeak. Thoſe that are aggreeued, and haue to complayn of ſome iniury doone them, or alſo thoſe that are euen the familiars of the fauored, &amp; that doo but aſpire dayly to grow in greater credit w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their prince then others, doo not ſee any thing ſayd or doon to others, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are in better credit then them ſelues: (bee it in eating, drinking, watching, ſleeping, in play, beeing quyet or buyſy,) but they ſodeinly goe and report it, and tell it to ſome other that ys in fauor, to enter and to encreaſe always into greater fauor &amp; truſt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them. If there happen any diſcention or enmity amongſt the people in the common weale, or realme, the eſteemed of the court muſt beeware in any caſe they put in their hand: &amp; if they doo at all, that it bee but to pacify them, &amp; to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good frends again, &amp; not to diſcouer them woorſe then they were beefore. For if hee doo otherwiſe, all theſe quarels in the end ſhal ceaſe, (they beeing recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled togethers, and now made parfet frends) and to him they will all ſhew them ſelues open enemies. And therefore it beehooueth the fauored of princes to bee haue them ſeleus ſo wiſely towards them that are at diſcord &amp; variaunce togethers, that both the one ſyde and the other ſhoold bee glad and well pleaſed, to make him arbitrer beetweene them to decide both their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: without any ſuſpicion that they haue of him (bee it neuer ſo litel) of parci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of eyther part. The ſame day that the fauored of the court ſhall take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him to beare any priuat affection to any of the common weale, and that hee rather lean to one party or to an other: the ſelf ſame day and hower hee ſhall put in great haſard his perſon, and not without great daunger to loſe his goods) together with the fauor and credit of his prince. And the ſecret e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies hee hath (through the enuy they beare him) ſhould ſuffice him, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to much, by reaſon of his fauor and credit) without ſeekyng any new e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, for that hee ſayth or dooth. Such as are great with the prince, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flye
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21411:323"/>
the paſſions affections, and partialities, of the common weale may bee aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red they ſhallbee beeloued, ſerued, and honored of all: but if they ſhal doo the contrary, they may truſt to yt likewiſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their enemyes wil bee reuenged of them, beecauſe they dyd purſue them: And their frends alſo will complayn of them, beecauſe they dyd not fauor their cauſe as they ought. Therefore let not the beelyked thynk, if hee dare beeleeue mee, that by hauyng onely the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor of the perſon of the prince, it is inough for hym to gouern and rule the whole realme at his pleaſure. For although yt can not bee denyed, that to haue ſo great a frend as the perſon of a kyng, it is a great aduantage &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and that hee may doo much: yet wee muſt graunt alſo, that many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, are able to hurt vs, and doo vs great iniury. And therefore my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe ſhould bee, that euery wiſe man, hauing one a frend: ſhould bee ware to haue an other enemy.</p>

                     <p>SVrely it is a great ſeruitude and trouble to lyue in court contynually, but it is a farre greater when it is enforced of neceſſity (by reaſon of ſuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and troubles) and yet greateſt and moſt intollerable, when they can not obteyn a ſhort and breef diſpatch according to their deſire. For weying well the manner and condicions of the court, that ſuiter may recken him ſelf happely diſpatched, euery time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee is quicly diſpatched, although his diſpatch bee not according to his mynd. And I ſpeak it not without a cauſe, that hee may recken him ſelf well diſpatched when hee hath his aunſwer. For wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comparyſon it is leſſe ill of both, for the poore ſuyter that attends on the court, to bee preſently denyed hys ſuyt, then to continew hym long wyth delayes as they doo now a dayes, the more is the pitty. If the poore ſuiters (tgat goe to the court) dyd know certaynly that the delay made in their ſuyts were for no other occaſion, but for to diſpatch them well, according to theyre deſire: although it were not ſo reaſonable, yet were yt tollerable the payns and trouble that they abide. But if the poore myſerable and wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures haue great trouble in trauerſing the law, and abyding their orders: obteyning it neuertheleſſe in the end with great labor and toyle, yea and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their expectacion: haue they not yet matter inough trow yee to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playn of? yes ſuer, inough to make them diſpaire. What ſo euer hee bee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that goeth to the court to bee a ſuyter for any matter of import, let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termyn and think with him ſelf hee ſhal not obteyn his ſuyt euen as he woold haue it. For if hee ſhall feede him ſelf with certayn promiſſes, made in priuat (a thing common to courtiers, to promis much, and performe nothing) &amp; with other vayn and fooliſh thoughts: the great hope hee ſhall conceyue of their ſmokes of court, muſt needes geeue him afterwards occaſion to diſpaire whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee ſeeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promis vnperformed. The court is a ſea ſo deepe, a pilgrimage ſo incertain, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there wee dayly ſee nought els, but lambs ſwymme w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſafty in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deepeſt chanel, &amp; elephants drown in the ſhaloweſt foord. To go ſue, to ſerue,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:324"/>
to trauayl, &amp; to ſolicite in the court of princes, may aptly bee likened &amp; compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thoſe that put in many rych iewels to the lottery in open market: in w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> it happeneth very oft, that hee that hath put in a .100. lottes ſhall not happen perhaps of one, and an other that onely hath put in one, fortune ſhall ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor hym, that hee ſhal euer after bee made a rych man. The lyke wee may ſay to hym that hath lyued ſo long in court, that hee hath not onely got hym a beard, but it is alſo now beecome a gray beard: and yet in al this long tyme of his ſeruice hee hath not gotten him any certainty, or ſtay of lyuing to lyue honeſty withal, to mayntayn his aged yeares in quyet: and hee may well ſay, that all the lottes haue been vnfortunat to him which hee put in auenture. It is trew, that to bee called a good &amp; vertuous man, it ſuffyceth to haue a ſharp wytte and good head: but to beecome rych, hee muſt onely haue good fortune. And this is playnly ſeene in the court, that ſome in fower months wil grow great like a Melone, and ſome other in forty years wil neuer beare but litle fruyt, like a palme tree. Wee haue tolde you all theſe things to this end, onely to remember thoſe that goe to the court of princes to follow any ſuyt, or to continew a courtier ſtill, that in any caſe they cary a purſe wyth them full of money, &amp; a hart armed with paciens. O what pyty is it euery way to ſee him that is a ſuter in the court, to bee long haled with a tedious ſute, and in the end not to obteyn any part of his deſire, without a litle pleaſyng wynd of court. For if hee will haue his ſute goe forward, and take good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, &amp; haue it ſpeedely graunted, hee muſt firſt buy it of god with bytter tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, &amp; afterwards of the kyng with humble interceſſion, of the ſecretaryes with promyſſes, and of the vſſhers with preſents, &amp; of the beeloued &amp; in auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with infynit ſeruice: So that to conclude, farre greater is the reward they craue, then the valew, of the fauor or benefyt they beeſtow. If I haue diſcourſed to you ſufficiently what the vnlucky ſuters haue doone and doo: you ſhall further know what they think &amp; doo imagyn, as it falleth out true. The ſeely ſoules they paſſe the nights in watch, deuiſing continually, not in what church the next day they may heare diuine ſeruice, but onely what means they may procure to come to the ſpeach of the fauored of the court, to ſpeak one woord vnto them. The poore ſuter (vnſkylfull of courtly practiſe) beleeueth, that when hee hath once exhibited a bill or memoriall of his ſuyt to the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of requeſts, or that hee hath ſpoken a woord or two to any one in fauor with the prince, that ſtraight without further delay hee ſhallbee diſpatched of his ſute, and that hee ſhall not neede to ſue any more. But alas they are deceyued, and preuented of theyre expectacion. For the vnhappy ſuter ſhalbee no ſooner out of his ſyght, but they preſently forget all that hath been ſayd to them, yea and peraduenture his mynd ſo occupyed, that hys byll of memoriall is alſo torne in peeces, and hys ſuyt and bill commytted to flying ayre. Thaffaires of the warres are doone by force and neceſſity, and thoſe of frends by good will, but thoſe of the myſerable ſuyters of the court, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or grete importunity. So that it followeth that hardly any man obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the end of his ſuyt (bee his ryght neuer ſo good) without grete dyligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and paynfull toyle. And many tymes the poore ſuter of the court depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from his own houſe, and goeth to the court, on hope and deliberacyon to bee diſpatched in two monethes: and afterwards the poore myſerable man
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21411:324"/>
ſhall ſpend aboue ſyxe monethes there without diſpatche. But all this ys no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the greeſe and diſpleaſure hee ſhall felt in the end, if with better iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement hee meaſure and conſyder, the pleaſure and felicity hee might haue had at home, with the troubles and diſpleaſures hee abydeth in the court. For makyng account with his purſe, hee ſhall perhaps fynd all his money ſpent, ere his ſuyt in maner bee begoon. I told you but of a lytle woonder, to tell you that al his ill conſiſted in the empting of the purſe. For in deede I ſhoold haue ſayd better, and more truely, tellyng you that hee had ſold his nagge, layd his ſweord in gage, baratted his cote &amp; cloke, and of two ſhirts hee brought, the one hee ſolde: ſo that the ſeely man hath no more left to chop, nor ſell. And yet more ouer mee thinks I tel you lytel, If I ſhew you not alſo, that after he hath conſumed all his money hee brought in his purſe, ſold, chopped, &amp; layd to gage all the apparell that hee had, hee is notwithſtanding all this enforced for debt to gage to his hoſte all that that remayns behynd, to ſatiſfy hym for his lodging. So that when hee commeth home to his houſe, hee may ſay true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that hee commeth home wery, aſhamed, conſumed, and all that hee hath at gage. Hee that determineth to bee a ſuter at the court, is woont beefore hee goe from home, to make account what hee will ſpend euery day ordynaryly: but what hee ſhall ſpend extraordinaryly, againſt his will, that hee neuer rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of. And therefore I woold counſell him for the beſt, if hee put tenne crownes in his purſe for ordinary charges, let him alſo put tenne more for extraordinary. For it is impoſſible hee ſhould euer keepe an order &amp; meaſure, in ſo great a diſorder. For many times courtiers are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled for their honor &amp; reputacions ſake, to inuite their hoſtes &amp; owners of the lodging where they lye: &amp; beeſides the great charges they are at that way, yet come there vnbyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to dinner and ſupper a company of ieſters, players of enterludes, myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrells, &amp; muſitians, or other pleaſant companions whom hee can not refuſe &amp; turn away for honeſties ſake, but muſt needes make them eat &amp; drink bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the reward they looke for. So that when hee hath made his account of tenne or xx. ſhillings charges for his dinner or ſupper, let him looke in hys purſe, &amp; hee ſhal fynd theſe mates haue pickt vp in rewards aſmuch, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole charges of his dinner or ſupper beſides. More ouer they are dayly viſited of their frends &amp; kinſfolks, &amp; vitells are ſo deere &amp; of ſo exceſſiue price, that to ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke their prouiſion at the beſt hand, they muſt ſend out poſtes &amp; lackeis into all parts to bee their purueiers. And yet are they further recharged that many times their ſeruants robbe them of all their money &amp; runne their way when they haue doon, &amp; ſometimes they muſt new aray them ſelues, al w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> things y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courtier (in reſpect of his eſtimacion) is bound to doo thorowly, &amp; with the beſt maner, or els to ſequeſter &amp; baniſh him ſelf from court &amp; courtiers life. It is true that a poore gentelman or other ſuiter (that of neceſſitie muſt follow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court) knoweth very well the cauſe that mooueth him to bee a courtier, &amp; at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on the court, but yet hee ſhal not know what his charge &amp; expenſe wilbee about the ſuyt. If hee haue any fauor or credit in the court, hee may happely obteyn a quick and redy diſpatch, &amp; ſo perhaps ſaue ſome part of his money in his purſe hee determined to ſpend: without which hee ſhal not onely bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to borrow, but to ſend a new meſſenger to his houſe for more money. O (the more is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pyty) how many haue I ſeen in princes courts ſpend til that
<pb facs="tcp:21411:325"/>
euer they brought to the court to follow their ſuyt, &amp; yet could not bee diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in any thing hee came for, ſaue that in ſteede of their money they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſumed, they haue purchaſed them great troubles &amp; diſpleaſures, bewayling their loſt time, &amp; vayn expence. And it is to bee conſidered alſo, that if it bee a great dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyculty to ſpeak to the prince in our matter, to the preſedent of the counſell, to the maſter of the requeſts, &amp; to the priuy counſell, to the marſhals of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treaſorers, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cofferers, to the fouriers &amp; to the fauored of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, it is farre greater &amp; more trouble to enterteigne, &amp; content their ſeruants &amp; offy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. For I dare aſſure you, you ſhal ſooner &amp; more eaſly winne the loue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiſter, then you ſhal obtein the fauor &amp; good will of the ſetuant. Princes are contented if wee obey them: the fauored of the court if wee ſerue them: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruants are neuer contented, nor in quiet, if they ſee wee doo not worſhip them &amp; entreat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And ſurely I wil tel you a true tale, &amp; wil not lye a woord to you. In thoſe days when I my ſelf was alſo a courtier in the court of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it ſtoode mee vpon many times rather to trouble y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maiſters, then to pray the ſeruants. If perhaps (for penaunce of his ſinnes) the ſuter ſhew him ſelf importunat in his affaires, &amp; that hee preſume to dare ſay to him ſome nipping or vnpleaſant woord, let him bee wel aſſured he wil not bee reuenged on him, to hurt him w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſweord or launce: but onely in holding back his penne, to delay him in his diſpatch. For I remember, that once beeing but a poore preeſt, I was entreated by the procter of a prouince to ſay him a douzen of maſſes for a great noble man (&amp; in great fauor in the court) that had his matter in hys hands, &amp; hee coniured mee very earneſtly that I ſhould not ſay them for the health &amp; ſaluacion of his ſoule, but onely that god would inſpire him &amp; put into his mynd to diſpatch him quickly of his buyſines. Therefore as wee haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the one, it is reaſon wee ſhould alſo ſpeak of the other. And therefore I ſay that there are ſome of theſe officers &amp; clerks of Iudges, Magiſtrates, counſellers, ſecretaries, treaſorers, marſhals, fouriers, and other officers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the court that are ſo wiſe, &amp; men of ſuch honeſty, &amp; ciuility, that the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteſyes &amp; wrongs ſometimes their lord &amp; maiſters doo to vs, they doo the beſt they can either to take them from vs quite, or at the leaſt to leſſen or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myniſh them. For the contrary alſo, others there are ſo proud, &amp; ſhameles, ſuch tatlers, &amp; vile perſons, &amp; ſo vnconſcionable with all: of whom as it is a great pleaſure for vs to ſee that they write, and to heare that they can ſpeak ſo well, &amp; promeſſe ſo liberally, onely to winne your money, &amp; pick your purſe: ſo it is a great ſpight to vs, and more ſhame, reproche, and infamy for them, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards wee ſee the contrary effects of their faire woords, and fayned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, where with they feede vs continually. And addyng thereto alſo wee ſee many times that ſuch a yong courtier, in leſſe then fower years that he hath remayned in ſeruice with a noble man, or other officer of the kings in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, hath gotten by his practiſe &amp; pollicy a faire moyle of great price, with her har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes all gilt, his cofers well ſylled, his tent for the feelde with feeld bed &amp; other furniture to it, his carpets on his table, his clothes of tapeſtry ouer his doores his gowns richly furred for the winter, and thoſe of ſattin &amp; damaſk and taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feta for the ſommer: and yet notwithſtanding al this glory, hee may poſſyble keepe a curteſan for his pleaſure &amp; maintayn her. Al which things conſidered &amp; put together, it is impoſſible hee ſhould doo it by the gaines of his penne or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21411:325"/>
ſeruice, but onely by diſhoneſt means, &amp; robbing of his maſter. I ſaw once in my preſens a poore ſuter, offer the clark of a Secretary eight Rialls of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer for to diſpach him of his ſuyt, and hee refuſed them flatly, and would none of them by no means, notwithſtandyng the poore man turned him vp the bottome of his purſe, and ſhowed him that hee had but onely fower rialls left to bring him home withall. So y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poor man came to mee, &amp; intreated mee to ſpeak to this clark for him, to perſwade him to take his money hee offered him, and to diſpatch him, ſince hee had no more left then hee ſhewed hym.</p>
                     <p>And I did ſo. And this woorſhipfull clerk made mee this vnhoneſt aunſwer. Sir, behold my face and complexion, and you ſhall fynd that it is all of gold, and not of ſiluer. For I ſweare to you by our bleſſed lady of Lancet, that yt is more then two years that I receiued for reward of my payns no other but gold, and not ſiluer layd in my hands. It can not bee but that ſeruant y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes him ſelf to haue a face of gold, wil one day put his maiſters face in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myre. Now albeit wee ſee the kings officers and others peraduenture vnder them to ryde on their nagges with their foote clothes, to bee braue in apparell, to bee rich in iewels, and happely to haue a hundreth crownes in his purſe, wee ſhould not maruell of it at all: but if wee haue cauſe to think any thing yll in them, it is for that many times they play away more money fondly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> woold ſerue any other man to ſpend in all his neceſſaries. That officer or clerk that hath not aboue a hundreth crownes in his purſe, and that in a night playeth away two hundreth crownes, what iudgement ſhall a man geeue of him? but that eyther hee deceyueth others in his office, or hee ſtealeth &amp; pilfreth from his maiſter or lord, or els hee exacteth vppon the poore ſuters, and racks them withall extreamyty, without conſcience and honeſty, and that hee will haue yt on them euen with playn brawlyng? Yea and though theſe good felows bee liberall in play (as you haue hard) yet I warraunt you they are not ſpare of dyet neyther, but if they cal their frends at a time to their table in the hall, or els byd their curteſans to ſome gardein, you may bee aſſured they want no deynty meats, nor delycat wines to pleaſe their lyking luſt: yea peraduenture w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more coppy, &amp; better meat and drink then their maiſters or lords haue any. Heare could I mate them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like companions to them ſelues, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marchaunts prentices, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> for their lauiſh expence, their exceſſiue play, their luſty banke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and feaſting, otherwhile their ſecret frends in gardeins &amp; blynd tauerns, come not behynd them at al in delicacy of fare, and in ſuptuous expence, but rather goe before, &amp; leaue them farre behynd. And how think you, can theſe foule ryots &amp; diſorders bee born by any likelyhood of the prentices own abyli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? nay ſuer of the maiſters coſt (as beſt able) whoſe purſe paieth for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good cheere, though hee good man fare at home but thynly. But wel, ſence it tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not our matter, I wil retorn agayn where I left. All theſe things not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, they are diſhoneſt, are ſometimes tollerable &amp; to bee born, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe faults they would bee diligent to diſpatch men, &amp; eaſly to talk withal. But alas for pyty, wee ſee that for al theſe complaints they heare, &amp; for all the requeſts &amp; intreaty that may bee made to them, they wil neuer take penne in hand before the poore ſuter take his hand out of his purſe, that they may feele him a litle. Wee haue ſpoken al theſe things, to admoniſh, remember, &amp; to beſeech the fauored of the prince, and other their officers, that neither them
<pb facs="tcp:21411:326"/>
ſelues nor their ſeruants vnder them, bee long and ſlow in diſpatchyng ſuch thyngs as they haue in charge, and cheefely of poore and myſerable ſuters. For if wee conſider the qualities and condicions of men, wee ſee that to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuters yt were leſſe detriment and more profyt, to bee aunſwered quyckly (though they were denied) then dyſpatched ſlowly (and to haue it graunted) to their great charge and long trouble. Truely mee thinks it is a great ſecret of god to know, why all thoſe that are ſuyters in the court of prynces, &amp; thoſe alſo whom wee ſue to are all mortall: And all the ſuyts y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee labor for, ſeeme (yea to ſay more truely) are immortall. And hereof wee ſee a dayly expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that the ſuyters dye, and their ſuyts lyue for euer, beeing neuer deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. O excellent art, and fyne deuiſe of ſuyt that courtiers are woont to vſe, that are gratefull to princes, as for familyar example. They fynd a way to put in a thouſand manner of lets to hynder and delay the ſuyts, becauſe that when by tract of tyme they haue more then halfe dyſpayred the hopeles ſuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they then, to reuiue them agayn, and to make their honor ſeeme the grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter, diſpatch them euen in a moment without let or delay, and to the ſuters whole contentation. It is good reaſon the prince haue a regard of the thyngs hee geeues, and to whom hee graunts them, and like wiſe of the tyme and place. For in receyuing fauor or a good turne at the prynces hand, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make more account and eſtimate of the lyberalyty, and bountyfull mynd of the prince, then they doo of the gyfts them ſelues. Suer it ys a good thing, and laudable, for thoſe that are contynually about the perſon of the prynce, that they bee eaſy to bee ſpoken wythall, pacyent to heare, wyſe in aunſwering, of good fame in their life, and ready to diſpatch and doo good. For beeing otherwiſe, they may bee aſſured they ſhall ſhew the mark and white for their enemies to ſhoote their perſyng ſhaft at, and ſhall geeue the ſuyters alſo cauſe to complayn and ſpeak ill of them. And therefore to cuite them ſhort, I counſell them, that in thoſe things they are beſought, that they bee not too hard to bee entreated: and in that they are requeſted, that they bee neuer too ſtraunge, nor drawyng back, much leſſe couetous, and in thoſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are geeuen them, they bee neuer vnthankfull: and with thoſe that they are conuerſaunt, that they bee very well aduiſed and conſydered: &amp; thoſe thyngs whereof they are aduertiſed, that they endeuor them ſelues to keepe yt in mynd and memory, and neuer to forget yt. And if they ſhall doo other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe, let them aſſure them ſelues, and truſt vnto yt, that if they in tyme of ſute ſhall ſhut the doores againſt the poore ſuyters, that the common people alſo will neuer open their harts once to ſerue or loue them. Princes ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts ſhould ſo gouern them ſelues, that though there were found ſome yll perſons that diſpiſed them, for that they might doo much, and were of great autoritie: yet that there might bee many others alſo honeſt, that ſhoold prayſe and commend them for the great good they doo. That man that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyed, diſprayſed, defamed, diſloued, and ill thought of of al, ſhould think it leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ill to dye honeſtly, then to lyue with ſhame and in diſgrace of euery man. For to ſay truely, mee thynks no man could lyue a more bitter and hard lyfe, although hee abode many ſorows, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſee him diſliked generally of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale. It is an honeſt and natural thing for men to indeuor them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues by all dyllygence and induſtry to get much, but it ſhould bee farre better,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21411:326"/>
and much more worth, to procure them ſelues good wil. For in effect nothing dooth more ſatiſfy and glad the hart, and maketh it more quiet, then to think that hee is beloued, and wel accepted of all. It is a moſt certein rule, that the foes and enemies of the fauored courtiers neuer ioyn in frendſhip w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> others, but with thoſe whom they know to bee full of paſſions and quarels like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. Of which detractors if any one happen at times to goe to the houſe of the honored of the court, vppon any occaſion of ſute, and that they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſpeak with him: they will not ſay I warrant you that hee was buſy, and coold not ſpeak with him, but that hee was ſo proud and ſo haughty that hee woold not once hear nor ſee them. Wee are ſo wylling and forward in wiſhing well, and ſo ſelf willed and obſtinate in hating, that vppon a very light occaſion many tymes wee loue thoſe wee loue, and with a much leſſe occaſion wee defame and ſpeak yll of thoſe wee hate. Therefore the fauored of princes ſhall doo great ſeruyce to God, and much profitt to the common weal, if they geeue order to diſpatch all ſuters (high or low) ſpeedely: Since it is to the kyng only that they impute the denyall of their ſuites, but for the delay and prolongation of them, they only lay it to the charge of the fauored and beeloued of princes. And thoſe that are great with the Prince, may not excuſe them ſelues by reaſon of the nombers of matters they haue in theyr hands. For if hee bee alone, and that it lye in his hands only to dyſpatch all, and that hee is not able to ſatiſfy them all, yt cannot bee but that ſome one of his frends wyll aduertiſe the kyng that hee cannot doo all, and how the people complain, and the poore ſuters fynd them ſelues agreeued, whych purchaſe him great enemies and yll willers, by reaſon the common wealth ys ſo altered. So that hee ſhall not tarry long, but the Prince vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng of theſe complaynts, will ioyn a companion with him to eaſe hym of ſome part of his paine. And therefore the good Princes ſhoold admoniſh, and warne the officers well (whom they take to help to diſpatch matters) that they bee wiſe and learned men, and of good lyfe, and that they bee not too partiall in their dooings, nor too ſharp &amp; rough in their aunſwers. For many tymes there happen more troubles and ſiniſter chaunces to Prynces and noble men, for the vncurteous language of their offycers and deputyes, then for any yll that they them ſelues doo commit. And therefore thoſe that are in fauor and auctority wyth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, muſt of neceſſity foreſee to chooſe vnder them ſuch perſons, to whom they geeue the care and charge of theyr affayrs and buſynes, to diſpatch mens matters and ſuyts, that they bee libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of condition, pleaſant in their conuerſation, curteous in aunſwers, true in their wrytings, eaſy and dyligent in their diſpatches, very honeſt and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in that they geeue or take, and ſincere and perfitt in all their other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues if it bee poſſible: So that they may euer bee more carefull to gett frends for their maiſters, then money. For lyke as the lyfe of the maiſter of the ſhip conſiſteth, and dependeth in the only guyde and iudgement of the Pilot, and the conſciens of the iudge in hys conſtitute, the goods of the marchant in his factor, and the victory of the prince in his Captayn: Euen ſo likewiſe dooth the honor of the fauored conſiſt in thoſe hee hath choſen officers vnder him for the diſpatch of mens affairs. And although the ſeruaunt of the beelyked
<pb facs="tcp:21411:327"/>
bee no partaker with his maiſter of his fauor with the prince, yet is hee a coadiutor to him to ſupport his credit and fauor; and many tymes alſo a ready mean vtterly to vndoo his maiſter and to diſhonor him for euer. The lyke watch and care the good biſhop hath ouer his flock, to preach vnto them the Goſpell of Iheſus Chriſt: the ſelf ſame ought the magiſtrats and higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers haue to their officers that are vnder them, in taking heed that they bee not ſlow and negligent in diſpatching ſuch buſines as they haue in charge, that they bee not diſhoneſt of lyfe, preſumptuous in demaunding, and falſe in their writing. For the leaſt of theſe faults ſuffiſeth vtterly to vndoo the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, and alſo to defame the maiſter. And therefore ſo ſoone as the beloued of the court haue any ſuſpition in the world, or ynkling (bee it neuer ſo little) that his ſeruaunt is growen to bee proud, diſhoneſt, and of a naughty conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens; hee ought not only immediatly to correct him for it: but to put hym out of his ſeruyce forthwith, and to turne his coat ouer his ears. Otherwiſe they will murmure ſo much at the ſeruaunt that dooth all theſe faults, as at the maiſter that will not ſee them, and ſuffereth them. Therefore the reputed of court muſt firſt ſee, and peruſe ouer the writings and dooings of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts and ſecretaries, before they diſpatch them out of their hands, and to moderat their gayn with reaſon that is due to them. Otherwiſe their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies might iuſtly ſay, that they keepe not ſuch vnder them to diſpatch poore men that ſue to their maiſters, but rather to ſpoyle &amp; robbe them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were better augment their wages they geeue thoſe officers and ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaunts, then to confent or diſſemble with their theft. For ſo dooing, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt can neuer ryſe in wealth, but the maiſter muſt needes diminiſh in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. It may happen many tymes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the eſteemed of the court ſhalbee ſo oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in thaffairs of the comonweal, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee cannot (though hee woold) geue audiens to the ſuters. But when they are thus occupied that they cannot in deede, they muſt then commaund their ſeruaunts and officers, that they cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly entreat them, and heare them, and not check or rebuke them, and call them importunat ſuters. For it is no reaſon, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for diſpatch of their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the poore ſoules ſhoold bee laden with iniurious woords.</p>

Wherefore <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> moued with pity and compaſſion of ſo great a tyraunt, whych for their ſakes theyr commonweal indured, one day in the market place beefore all hys people wyth a lowd voyce ſpake theſe woords,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:328"/>Know you, O you people of <hi>Athens,</hi> that if you doo not lay hands on my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding preſumption, and on the ouergreat ambition of <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> that our gods wilbee offended, the temples will fall down to the hard foundation, our treaſures wilbee conſumed, our ſelues deſtroyed, and our common weales brought to vtter ruyn and decay. Therefore once agayn good people I ſay, brydle, brydle theſe our inordinat and vnſpeakable affections beetymes, leſt the rayns layd on our neckes wee runne to farre. O golden woords of a prince, and woorthy eternall fame. <hi>Lucanus</hi> alſo when hee woold reproue the preſumption and pryde of the Romayn princes, ſayd, that <hi>Pompei</hi> the great coold neuer abyde to haue any for his compagnion or equall with him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Rome: And <hi>Iulius Ceſar</hi> alſo woold neuer ſuffer that there ſhoold bee any greater in the world then hym ſelf. And therefore to diſcourſe a lyttle of this abhominable and horrible vyce of pryde, wee haue not wythout great reaſon layd beefore you theſe approued examples, beefore wee beginne to reprooue it. For in all things thexamples wee ſhew you are wont to moue vs more, then the reaſons wee ſeeme to tell you of. For that that I haue ſeene, for that I haue read, and for that that I haue hard ſay alſo of others, I am moſt aſſured and reſolued thereof, that by the only cauſe of this wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſinne of pryde, proceedeth the ruyn and vtter decay of all our greateſt things and affairs of our lyfe, for by all other ſinnes a man may in deede deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend and declyne from his degree and ſtate of honor and eſtimacion, but by this only ſinne, hee cannot choſe, but hee muſt fall down flat to the grownd. They fynd out the middeſt and center of the earth, the depth of the ſea, and the higheſt tops of <hi>Riphei</hi> mountains, the end of the great mount <hi>Caucaſus,</hi> and the beginning of the great fludd <hi>Nile:</hi> and only the little hart of man, touching deſire to rule &amp; commaund, can neuer fynd end. Thinſatiable coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes is ſuch, that it cannot bee contented with the things wee haue, but only with thoſe wee repute of leſſe price. Lykewiſe ambition and pryde to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund cannot bee conteined within bounds, but only by obeying. For neuer no vyce can haue end, if hee that hath it dooth not leaue it, and baniſh it from him. After <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had conquered all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and had ſubdued the great <hi>India,</hi> hee was one day reproued of the great Philoſopher <hi>Anacharſes,</hi> who told him theſe woords. Sith thou art now, O <hi>Alexander,</hi> lord of all the earth, why dooſt thou weary thy ſelf ſo much in thy affairs, as no payn ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth troubleſom to thee? To whom <hi>Alexander</hi> anſwered. Thou haſt told mee many times <hi>Anacharſes,</hi> that beſides this world there are alſo three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And if it bee ſo (as thou ſayſt) how great a reproche and infamy were it to mee, that beeing three other worlds, I ſhoold bee lord but only of one. Therefore I doo dayly ſacrifyce to the gods, that though they take mee out of the lyfe of this world, yet at leaſt that they wil not deny mee of ſo glorious a conqueſt. I confeſſe that the Scriptures excepted, I haue no woords ſo ryfe in memory as theſe, whereby may eaſely bee perceiued, that to quiet and content a proud hart, the ſeignory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world is not yet ſufficient, and how ended the pryde of this glorious prince? euen thus. Hee that hoped to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer &amp; bee lord of the three other worlds, dyd not rule this one only aboue .iii. yeres. Wee may boldly ſay this, &amp; ſwere it, &amp; may alſo playnly proue it to any that deſire to ſee it, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee wanteth both wit &amp; knowledge, that taketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21411:328"/>
to bee proud, and preſumptuous. For the more hee looketh into him ſelf, and conſidereth and reconſidereth his ſtate and calling, &amp; what hee is, hee ſhall fynd in him a thowſand occaſions fit to humble him, but neuer a one only to make him proud and haughty. How great, rych, myghty, noble, and woorthy ſo euer the parſon bee, euery tyme that wee happen to ſee him, and that wee haue no acquayntaunce of hym. And that wee deſyre to know what hee is, wee doo not aſk of what element, of what ſea, of what fyre, of what planet, of what clymat, of what ſunne, of what moone, nor of what aier, but only of what countrey hee is of, and where hee was borne. For wee are all of the earth, wee liue in the earth, and in thend wee haue to turne into the earth, as to our naturall thing. If the planets and the beaſts coold help vs wyth the inſtrument and benefite of the tongue, they woold take from vs the occaſions of vayn glory. For the ſtarres woold ſay, that they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the firmament, the Sunne in the heauens, the byrdes in the ayer, the Salamaunder in the fyer, and the fyſh in the water: but only the vnhappy man was made of earth, and created in the earth. So that in that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, wee cannot glory to haue other kinſfolk neerer to vs, then are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, the flyes, and horſeflyes. If a man did conſider well what hee were, hee woold aſſertain vs that the fyer burnes him, water drownes him, the earth wearies him, the ayre troubles him, the heate greeues him, the cold hurts him, and the day is troubleſom to him, the night ſorowfull, hunger and thirſt makes him ſuffer, meat and drink filles him, his enemies daily follow him, and his frends forget him. So that the tyme a man hath to lyue in thys wretched world, cannot bee counted a lyfe, but rather a long death. The firſt day wee ſee one borne, the ſelf ſame wee may make rekening that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes to dye: and although that parſon lyued amongſt vs a hundreth yeres after in this world, wee ſhoold not ſay therefore that hee lyued along tyme, but only that hee taryed a great tyme to dye. Therefore that parſon that hath his lyfe tyed to ſo many trybutes, I can not deuyſe or think with my ſelfe why, or wherefore hee ſhoold bee proud. But now returning againe to our purpoſe, let vs ſay, and exhort the ſeruaunts and familiers of princes, that they take heede they bee not proud and preſumptuous. For it ſeeldom happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that the fauored of kings and princes fall out of fauor and credit for that they haue, or can doo much, nor for that they craue and deſyre much: but for that they are to bold, and preſume to much. For in the court of kings &amp; Princes there is nothing more hurtfull and leſſe profitable, then pryde and preſumption. For oft tymes the ouerweening of the courtier, and the foolyſh vayne pryde and reputacion hee hath of hym ſelf, brings him to bee in the princes diſgrace, and makes the people alſo to bee offended and angry wyth him. For till this day wee neuer ſaw, nor hard tell of any that euer got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the princes fauor and credit, for that hee was proud and high mynded: but only for that hee hath ſhewed himſelf an humble, obedient, curteous, louyng, and a faithful ſeruant. I woold bee of this mynd, that the courtier that ſeeth hee is receiued into fauor in the princes court, ſhoold euer waxe better in ſeruing well, then grow woorſe in preſuming to much. And I dare boldly ſay and affirme, that it is a mere point of folly, by his pryde and raſheneſſe to loſe all that good in one day, that by great good fortune hee hath attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:21411:329"/>
to in many yeres. And though that the fauored courtier (ſubiect poſſible to his fantaſticall humor) bee ſometymes ouercome wyth cholor, carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre, drawen with auaryce, and addicted to the gorge, enuenomed with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, plunged inſloth and ydlenes, or ſome other vyce and imperfection, it ſhal not ſkill much, neither bee any great wonder, ſince all mankynd is ſubiect to thoſe paſſions: and neither the prince, nor the common weale, will recken much of that. For of all theſe faults and vyces there can come no greater hurt to him, ſaue only that that the common people woold murmure againſt him. But his pryde and pecokes glory once knowen and eſpied, euery man caſteth his eys vppon him to beehold his princely gate, and curſeth hym in woord and deede. Therefore let a man bee in as great fauor as hee can deuyſe to bee, as woorthy, noble, ritch, and of as great power and aucthority as hee deſyreth to bee: I neuer ſaw any yll in al my lyfe, if with al theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues hee were proud and high mynded, but in thend hee was perſecuted of many, and hated and enuyed of all. For thoſe that are in greateſt fauor about the prince, haue ſecret enemies enough to hinder their credit, although they doo not purchaſe them new, to accuſe them of their pryde and preſumption. And as wee are taught by experience, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> burning coal cannot long bee kept alyue, without it bee couered with the whot ymbers. Euen ſo I mean, that the fauor of the prince cannot bee long maintained, without good bringing vp, and ciuile maners, gentle conuerſation, and familiarity. The great me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of auctority about the prince runne eſtſones into great and many daungers: and this happeneth, becauſe they woold not bee reproued in any thing what ſo euer they doo, much leſſe here any woord that ſhoold diſpleaſe them, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they abyde to bee told of their faults, much leſſe ſuffer to bee correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them. Nether doo they ſuffer willyngly to bee counſelled in any thing, bee it neuer of ſo great weight and importance, neyther woold they haue any compaygnion with them in fauor and credit with the Prince, but they deſire to bee both on the right hand of the prince, and of the left: ſtyll they only woold bee the fauored of the prince, and none other: aſpiring to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them in all their dooings, and to bee thought and reputed the ſole and only rulers of the affairs of the prince, and his common weal, and to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in all things of the prince, and to bee obeyd alſo of the comon people. Thoſe therfore that are continually reſient in the court of princes, and that haue the cheefeſt roomes and offices of auctority in the court, let them well conſider, and keepe in memory this one woord that I will tell them. And that is this. That the firſt day that they take vppon them to bee ſuperinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and gouernors of the common weal, euen in the ſelf ſame day they ſhal come to put in haſard their honor, fauor, and credit, how great ſo euer it bee. For with great difficulty are the leſt things the prince himſelf co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeth, executed or doon in his realm or common weal: and therefore may the fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the court ſee, how much more hard it is for him to rule, (as ſole &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute lord) the affairs of the realme, and to bee obeied in the common weal: ſince the kyng him ſelf cannot doo it by his regall auctority. And therefore the leſſe hee ſhall deſire to meddle with thaffairs of the people, the more ſhall hee lyue in quiet and contented. For naturally the common people are ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and vncertain in their dooings, vnthankfull of benefits receiued, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21411:329"/>
ſo ingratefull of a good turne doon them: that the beloued of the court or any other perſon in fauor with the prince can euer doo any thing for the people, (bee it neuer ſo well) but they will ſpeak ill, and miſlyke of him, and fynd fault with ſome of his dooings. It is impoſſible that thoſe that will commaund many things in the court of princes ſhoold alwais doo their things ſo, but they ſhoold ſometime tread awry. And admit their faults bee but light, and of ſmall moment, yet they may bee aſſured there wilbee enow that will both open them to the comon weal, and tell them alſo ſecretly to the prince alone. For thoſe that ſeeke to deuorce the fauored of the court from the prince, doo not complayn or fynd fault for that they are more in fauor with the prince tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> others, but they will ſhew they take it in yll part, they haue more aucthority, and commaund more then others in the comonweal. Saying that by mean of their place &amp; autority, &amp; vnder colour of good zeal to miniſter Iuſtice, they geeue comonly foul &amp; iniurious woords, farre vnfitt for the aucthority of the perſon, &amp; woorthynes of the place. So that it cannot bee otherwiſe choſen, but that continuing this diſorder, they muſt needes make the king ſuſpect them, &amp; beſides that bring a great diſcord betwixt the king &amp; thoſe that hee fauoreth, &amp; make him meruelouſly offended with them. For in thend, princes woold alwais bee ſerued, &amp; obeyed, but not ruled, &amp; commaunded. And yt is a moſt true ſaying. Ouer much familiarity bredeth contempt, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> although yt may bee borne betweene men of lyke degree &amp; equality, yet is it not tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble betweene the prince &amp; the beliked of the prince. But rather euery day, hower, &amp; moment that the fauored courtier entreth into the princes palace, or into his priuy chamber, hee ought euer to doo it with as great curteſy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, humility, &amp; honor, &amp; in ſpeaking to the king, as if hee had neuer ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, nor ſeene him. So that hee ſhoold let all men ſee, that though it pleaſe the kings maieſty to make of him, and to accept him into his fauor, yet that hee leaue not to ſerue him, &amp; doo him that duity that all other ſeruants doo, &amp; are bound to doo. The ſuereſt and moſt certain way to maintain thoſe that are ſublimed, &amp; exalted in the court of princes, &amp; to raiſe &amp; bring thoſe to auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority that are low &amp; of baſe condition, is: that the eſteemed repute him ſelf euer a ſeruaunt, &amp; that the ſeruant neuer vaunt nor boſt him ſelf to bee fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or eſteemed. The familiers of princes ought euer to be ware that there come no complaints of them to the princes ears. For as a drop of water, by tyme &amp; continuall fall cometh to perce the hardeſt ſtone: ſo it myght happen that the nombers of complaints, might bee occaſion for the prince to w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>draw his fauor &amp; loue from the courtier again. If his only ſeruyces were ſufficient to induce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince to fauor &amp; loue him: ſo the nomber of his ſubiects co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints againſt him, were occaſion enough to make him miſlike him, &amp; put him out of fauor clean, changing his loue &amp; fauor, to hate &amp; diſcredit it. For it a certeyn thing, that when the prince dooth looke well into his own dooings, hee had rather bee beloued of all, then ſerued of one alone. The honored of the court may not regard ſo much the honor &amp; credit hee is called to by his prince, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baſenes &amp; pouerty hee was in, when it pleaſed the king to lyke of him, &amp; that hee came firſt acquainted with the king. For if hee did otherwiſe, it myght happen, that like as fortune had brought him to that high eſtate hee had: So pryde might ouerthrow him agayn, &amp; bryng him as low as hee was before.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:330"/>
For I ſhoold haue ſaid more truely a great deal, ſaying that it woold haue made him fall down right, beeing the right property of fortune, to ſuffer the baſer ſort (whom ſhee had called to honor) only to returne them to their mean eſtate &amp; call, they were of at the firſt, &amp; neuer to leaue the fauored of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, &amp; men of auctority (nor neuer ſatiſfied) till ſhee haue throwen them down hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into extreme miſery, neuer to ryſe againe. <hi>Agathocles</hi> (firſt the ſonne of a Potter, &amp; afterwards made king of <hi>Scicillia</hi>) whileſt hee liued, hee euer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this maner, that in his treſory or iewel houſe, yea and alſo at his table, amongſt all his cupps and diſhes of gold &amp; ſiluer, hee had ſome alſo of earth amongſt them: and beeing aſked the occaſion, why in ſo great a treaſure, and maſſe of gold &amp; ſiluer hee had ſo vyle a thing as earth, aunſwered thus. I drink in golden cupps and eat in earthen diſhes, to geeue thanks to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods, which of a potters ſonne that I was, brought mee to this royall ſtate of a mighty king. And I doo it alſo to haue euermore cauſe to bee hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, &amp; to fly pryde. For it is an eaſier thing, and more lyker for a king to become a potter, then for a potter to attayn to the greatnes and ſtate of a king. Theſe woords of <hi>Agathocles</hi> were euer woorthy to bee noted &amp; had in memory, ſince wee ſee plainly, that to geeue a man a fall, a little ſtone ſufficeth to make vs ſtum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble and fall to the ground: but to raiſe vs vp again, wee muſt needes help vs with power of hands and feete. It may well bee, that this braue courtier &amp; fauored of the court before hee came to this degree of honor, was but of a mean houſe, and baſely borne, and beſydes that eſteemed of few, for his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of blood: of an vnknowen contrey, of poore parentage, of ſmall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and no better nor otherwiſe fauored of fortune in his birth or lynage. of all which things hee hath no cauſe to bee aſhamed, but rather to glory, and praiſe god. For hee ſhall euer bee more eſteemed in the court, &amp; well thought of, to remember from whence hee came, and to regard his firſt eſtate: then hee ſhall, if hee wax glorious, and hygh mynded, by reaſon of the fauor hee is in at this preſent vtterly forgetting his firſt ryſing. <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> reciteth that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> renowmed Romayn <hi>Quintus Cincinatus,</hi> before hee came to bee made captain of Rome, hee was taken out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feelds a laboring man, plowing &amp; tilling y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground. And this ſo noble perſon, being occupied in great affairs of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common weal, either in prouiſions, or munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or in expeditions of warre, was woont to ſygh before all the captains, and ſay. Alas, who coold tell mee now any newes, how my beefes doo in my graunge, my ſheepe in the mountains, and whether my ſeruaunts haue prouided them of hay and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to keepe them the next yere? Surely it is to bee thought, that who ſo euer ſpeaks theſe woords with his mouth, muſt needes haue lytle pryde in his hart. And vndoubtedly hee proued his woords true, and ſhewed that hee ſpake as hee thought, and in good earneſt, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out intent of ieſt: ſince after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hee returned home again, to folow the plough, to plant his vynes, &amp; to ſee his own things gouerned, leui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g behind him a perpetual teſtimony of his noble &amp; worthy dooings. And his comon weal alſo gretly enryched by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous acts. <hi>Saul</hi> was king of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> &amp; taken for a god, &amp; was anointed of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell</hi> his father a poor huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dman of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey, &amp; hee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his youth brought vp in that trade to hold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plough: &amp; yet when hee was king, hee neuer diſdei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to plough his ground, to ſow his otes, and to dryue hys beaſtes, now to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21411:330"/>
paſture them home again. So that the good king did glory this day to hold the plough, and to morow to fyght with his ſwoord. When fortune therefore ſheweth her ſelf enemy to any, and that from great dignity and high cal, ſhee ouerthroweth him, and bringeth him to low and mean eſtate: it is then that hee hath good cauſe to complain of fortunes cruelty, and to bewail his wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched happ, aſhamed to ſee his lothſom miſery. But when ſhee woorketh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, and from mean eſtate brings him to great honor &amp; credit, that muſt needes bee great honor and glory to him. Therefore I ſay let them beware, beware, that bear rule and aucthority in the court, that they bee not proud, glorious and high mynded, neither otherwiſe detected of any kynd of vyce, though the bee neuer ſo much in fauor and eſtimation. Sith fortune ſheweth moſt her ſpight againſt the proud, and diſdainfull hart, rather then to the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and meeke. To ſtopp the enemies mouth, there can bee found no better means, then for the derlyng of the court not to bee too proud and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, ſince no man is found ſo mad or fooliſh in the ſame, as once to dare to ſay, I accuſe this man, becauſe hee is in fauor and eſtimation: but hee may boldly doo it, when hee ſeeth in deede that hee is a proud glorious foole. If wee ſee the fauored of the court offended one with the other, wee will ſay it is but heat, if wee ſee him eat to much, wee will ſay it is but of a good ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack. If hee ryſe late, wee will excuſe him, and ſay it was late ere hee went to bedd, and that hee was wery with watching. If hee play oft, wee wil ſay hee dooth it for paſtime: yf hee bee careful in keeping that hee hath together; that hee is wiſe and pollytike: if hee ſpeak much, that hee is a pleaſant man &amp; geeuen to bee mery: yf hee ſpeak litle, that hee is wiſe and modeſt: yf hee ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d much, that hee is liberal and bountiful: but if hee bee glorious &amp; proud, what ſhal a man ſay on him, &amp; with what honeſt mean can wee excuſe him? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let others looke, For I know not. Truely for all other faults and errors of men, they may honeſtly bee excuſed, ſaue only that of pryde. For though many tymes wee commit other offences, it is but through frailty: but if wee offend in pryde, it commeth of a great folly, &amp; want of diſcretion. And for the contrary, the lowly &amp; curteous condition of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courtier, doo not only depreſſe &amp; reſiſt the detractions and murmurings of their enemies, but dooth inforce them againſt their willes to ſay wel of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For god dooth ſuffer many times that the peruerſe nature &amp; condition of one, is ſubdued &amp; ouercome, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good &amp; gentle vſage of an other. Therefore the beloued of court ſhoold take great heede, that they ſhew not them ſelues proud in their woords, &amp; much leſſe in their ceremonies w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they vſe in the court: as in going vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtairs, in entring in at the doores, in taking the ſtoole to ſitt down, &amp; alſo in putting of his cap. And though perhaps hee that ſhall read theſe our aduertiſments, will thynk them rather precepts for children, then for men: yet I will aunſwer him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles, that they are very neceſſary for thoſe that are in fauor in the court, and for all other courtiers, without the vſe of which hee may happely nooriſh a venemous Serpent in his breſt. And therefore not without great reaſon wee haue ſpoken that wee haue, that of too little heede taking, ſometymes there may folow great trouble to the fauored courtier. For many tymes they murmure more againſt him, in not putting of his capp, when hee is curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſaluted: then they doo, if they deny their fauor when they are requeſted.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:331"/>
If one courtier leaue to doo curteſie to an other, they ſay hee dooth yt not for that hee beareth him yll will: but for want of bringing vpp. But if hee bee great with the king, then they ſay it is not for want of good maner, but for that hee is too proud. To ſay truely, it is an vnhappy life, the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beloued in the court, ſith they attribute all their faults and errors to folly: although they committed them rather through negligence, and want of foreſight, then of pretenſed malyce, or yll will, as it is taken and thought. <hi>Gneus Flaccus</hi> a noble Romayn, going in company with other Romains to viſit a ſick man, and comming alſo an other romain to ſee the ſame ſick perſon lykewiſe, and being no place commodious in the chaumber wher the laſt might ſit down, neither any ſtoole left to ſitt down vppon: they ſay, hee roſe of on his ſtoole, and gaue him place that came laſt. The which humanity and curteſy was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards publiſhed among al the Romains, and after alſo greatly prayſed of the wryters. And the Romains alſo, beeing very true, graue, curious, and woorthy of great faith and credit in all that they wrote, it is to bee credited, that that act of curteſy was much noted and eſteemed, ſith they woold wryte it in the moſt noble and heroycall acts of their common weale. When the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uored courtier is accompanied with knights and gentlemen of the court, that brings him to the court, and it happen any to goe vp the degrees before him, hee ſhoold not paſſe for that, much leſſe ſhew any token that hee made any rekening of it. For to ſay troth, it is no great matter for him to goe vp bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him on the degrees of ſtone, ſith hee went beefore all on the degrees of fauor. What matter is it to the fauored or officer of the court, to ſee an other enter in at the ſtaier doore beefore him, if afterwards when they ſhall come where the king is, hee ſhall goe into the priuy chamber, as one that in deede is in fauor and beloued, and the other ſhal ſtand wythout like a ſheep? And to conclude I ſay, if I were in the nomber of thoſe that are thus bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and fauored of the king, I woold in the kings chamber vſe my fauor and credit, and abrod, all curteſy and ciuility.</p>

                        <hi>AVlus Gelius</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> render true teſtimony in their writings, that the honeſty of the Romains was ſo great in their eating, and their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty in their mainteining of them ſelues ſuch, that they did not ſuffer any romain citezen to haue any moe houſes then one to dwell in, nor but one gown to put on his back, one horſe to ryde vppon, not aboue two yoke of oxen to till his land. <hi>Titus Liuius, Macrobius, Cicero, Plutarch, Saluſt, Lucan, Seneca, Aulus Gelius, Herodian, Eutropius, Trebellius, Vulpitius,</hi> and all the other romayn writers doo neuer ceaſe to praiſe the auncient romain pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſaying the common wealth of Rome neuer loſt one iott of her greatnes, &amp; honor, during the tyme that they went abroad to conquer other realmes and dominions: but only ſince they began to geather treaſor together. <hi>Licurgus</hi> the Philoſopher (who afterwards was king of the Lacedemonians) or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined in his lawes hee made, that no neighbor ſhoold haue any more goods then an other: but that all houſes, lands, vynes, &amp; poſſeſſions, gold, ſiluer, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21411:331"/>
mouables, and generally all other things what ſoeuer, ſhoold bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently holden among them to the common vtilitie of all. And beeing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, why hee woold not conſent the common weal ſhoold haue her own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate commodities and particulers, anſwered thus: The payns and trauels men indure in this mortall life, and the great troubles &amp; diſorders that come dayly to the comon weal, chaunce not ſo much for that men haue neede of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to maintain them ſelues with all, but for that they doo deſire to leaue to their heirs and ſucceſſors. And therefore I haue appointed euery thing in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſubiects, becauſe that during their liues they might haue honeſtly to maintain them ſelues w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all, &amp; that they ſhoold leaue any thing to diſpoſe by will after their deaths. <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſayth alſo, that it was decreed by thinha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bitans of the Iles <hi>Baleares,</hi> that they ſhoold ſuffer none to come into theyr countrey to bring them any gold, ſiluer, ſilk, iewels, or precious ſtones. And this ſerued them to great profit. For by means of this law, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of .iiii. C. yeres that they had warres with the Romains, the Carthagians, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniares, neuer any of theſe nations once ſtirred to goe about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer their land, beeing aſſured that they had neither gold, nor ſiluer, to robbe or conuey from them. <hi>Promotheus</hi> that was the firſt that gaue lawes to the Egiptians, did not prohibit gold nor ſiluer in <hi>Egipt</hi> (as thoſe of the Iles <hi>Bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ares</hi> did in their territories) neither did hee alſo comand that all thing ſhoold bee common, as <hi>Licurgus:</hi> but only commanded, that none in all his kingdom ſhoold bee ſo hardy once to gather any maſſe or quantity of gold or ſiluer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp; to hoard it vp. And this hee did vpon great penalties: for as he ſaid, auarice is not ſhowed in buylding of fair houſes, neither in haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g rich moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, but in aſſembling &amp; gathering together great treaſure, &amp; laying it vp in their coffers. And <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his booke <hi>De conſolatione</hi> ſaith alſo, that if a rich man dyed among the Rhodians, leauing behind him one only ſonne &amp; no more ſuruyuing him, they woold not ſuffer that hee ſhoold bee ſole heyre of all that his father left: but they left him an honeſt heritage, &amp; lyuing, ſo hys ſtate &amp; call, &amp; to mary him well withall, and the reſt of all his ſethers goods they diſſipated among the poore &amp; orphans. The <hi>Lydians,</hi> that neither were Greekes nor Romains, but right barbarous people, had a law in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weal, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery man ſhoold bee bound to bring vp his children, but not to bee at tharges in beſtowing them in mariage: So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſonne or daughter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were now of age to mary, they gaue them nothing to their mariage, more then they had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their labor. And thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will exactly conſider this law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable cuſtom, ſhal fynd that it is rather a law of true philoſophers, then a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of barbarous people. Since thereby y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were inforced to labor for their lyuing, &amp; the parents alſo were exempted from al maner of couetouſnes or auarice, to heap vp gold &amp; ſiluer, &amp; to enrich them ſelues. <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> ſecond king of the romains, &amp; eſtabliſher of their laws &amp; decrees, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of the ſeuen tables w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> hee made, hee left them order only, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> way the Romayns might rule their comon weal in tranquility: &amp; put in no clauſe nor chapter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhoold make their willes, wherby their children might inherit their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers goods. And therfore being aſked why hee permitted (in his laws) euery man to get aſmuch goods as hee coold, &amp; not to diſpoſe them by wil, nor leaue them to their heirs: Hee anſwered, becauſe wee ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> albeeit there are ſome
<pb facs="tcp:21411:332"/>
children that are vnhappy, vicious, &amp; abhominable, yet are there few fathers notw<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding this, that will depriue &amp; diſherit them of their goods at theyr death, only to leaue them to any other heir: &amp; therefore for this cauſe I haue comaunded, that al the goods that remain after the death of the owner of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhoold bee geuen to the comon weal, as ſole heir &amp; ſucceſſor of them: to thend that if their children ſhoold become honeſt &amp; vertuous, they ſhoold then bee diſtributed to them: if they were wicked &amp; vnhappy, that they ſhoold neuer be owners of them, to hurt &amp; offend the good. <hi>Macrobius</hi> in his booke <hi>De ſomno Scipionis</hi> ſaith, that there was in the old tyme an old and ancient law amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the <hi>Tuſcans</hi> duly obſerued, &amp; kept, &amp; afterwards taken vp of the Romayns: that in euery place, where ſo euer it were, (in town or village) within their territories, on new yeres day euery man ſhoold preſent him ſelf beefore the iudge or magiſtrate of the place hee was in, to geeue him account of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of lyfe, &amp; now hee mainteined himſelf, &amp; in this examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtome to puniſh him that lyued ydlely, &amp; with knauery &amp; deceipt maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them ſelues: as minſtrels, ruffyans, dycers, carders, &amp; iuglers: coggers, foyſters, coſiners of men, &amp; ſylching knaues, with other loytering vacabo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds &amp; rogues, that lyue of others ſwett &amp; toyl, without any pain or labor they take vpon them to deſerue that they eat. I woold to god (if it were his will) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this <hi>Tuſcan</hi> law were obſerued of chriſtians: then wee ſhoold ſee how few they be in nomber, that geeue them ſelues to any faculty or ſcience, or other trade, to lyue by their own trauell &amp; induſtry: and how many &amp; infinit a nomber they bee that liue in ydle ſort. The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Timee</hi> ſayth, that although an ydle man bee more occaſion of many troubles &amp; inconueniences in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weal, then a couetous man, yet is it not alwais greater: for the ydle ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that gladly taketh his eaſe, dooth but deſire to haue to eat: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> couetous man dooth not only deſire to eat, but to bee rich and haue money enough.</p>
                     <p>All the eloquence and pleaſant ſpeche that the Orators ſtudyed in their ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the lawyers in their law, and the famous philoſophers in their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne and teaching, was for no other cauſe, but to admoniſh and perſwade thoſe of the common weal, to take very good heede in chooſing of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors, that they were not couetous and ambitious in thadminiſtration of their publyke affairs. <hi>Laertius</hi> recyteth alſo, that a Rhodian ieſting wyth <hi>Eſchines</hi> the philoſopher ſayd vnto hym. By the immortall gods I ſwere to thee O <hi>Eſchines,</hi> that I pity thee to ſee thee ſo poore, to whom he aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. By the ſame immortall gods I ſwere to thee agayn, I haue compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on thee, to ſee thee ſo rytch. Syth ryches bring but payn and trouble to gett them, great care to keepe them, diſpleaſure to ſpend them, peryll to hoard them, and occaſion of great daungers and inconuenyences to defend them: and that that greeueth mee moſt, is, that where thou keepeſt thy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure faſt lockt vp, there alſo thy hart is buryed. Surely <hi>Eſchines</hi> woords ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med rather ſpoken of a chriſtian, then of a philoſopher. In ſaying, that wher a mans treaſure is, there is alſo his hart. For there is no couetous man, but dayly hee thinks vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his hid treaſure: but hee neuer calleth to mind his ſinns hee hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring therfore thoſe things wee haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe things wee wil ſpeak, I ſay: that yt beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fauored of princes to know, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is leſſe ſeemly for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee couetous then others: For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gretnes of their fauor ought not to be ſhewed only in bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g rich, but alſo in bei<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g noble &amp; worthy

                        <hi>Plutark</hi> ſheweth, that <hi>Denis</hi> the Siracuſan commyng one day into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the prince hys ſonne, and fyndyng gryat ryches of gold and ſiluer that hee had geeuen hym, hee ſpake very angerly to hym and ſayd, thou hadſt beene farre fytter for a marchaunt of <hi>Capua,</hi> then to bee as thou art the kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſonne of <hi>Scicilla</hi> ſyth thou haſt a wyt to gather, but not to ſpend. Which is not fyt, nor lawfull for thee, if thou wylt ſucceede mee after my tyme in my kyngdome. And therefore I doo remember thee, that kyngdomes and hygh eſtates are not maynteyned with keepyng of ryches, but onely wyth geeuing, and honorably beſtowyng them well. And to this purpoſe alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyteth <hi>Plutarke,</hi> that <hi>Ptholomeus Philadelphus</hi> was demaunded, why hee was ſo ſlow, and with ſo great difficulty receyued the ſeruices of others: and was ſo liberall and noble in geeuing, and grauntyng fauors: hee aunſwered. I wil not get reputacion amongſt the gods, nor good renowne amongſt men for beeyng rych, but onely I will bee prayſed and eſteemed for makyng of others, rych, and hauyng vnder mee rich ſubiects. Theſe woords that <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomee</hi> ſayd to a frend of his, &amp; thoſe that <hi>Denis</hi> ſpake to his ſonne mee thynks the beloued of the court ſhould not onely bee contented to read them, but to ſeeke to keepe them ſtyll in mynd, ſyth by them wee may manifeſtly ſee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are euer more profytable for a man that oweth them, and geeueth them bountifully: then to haue them, and with couetouſnes to hoord &amp; lock them vp in their coffers. And the fauored of prynces ſhould not bee enuyed, for the goods that they can get by their fauor and credit, but onely for the good that thereby they may doo to their frends and kynſfolk. For they are thoſe that wyth others goods, make the people ſlaues to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. What greater nobility can there bee in thys world, then to make others noble? what greater ryches, then to make others rich? and what more lyberty, then to make others free? The glory y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the princes, and thoſe that they eſteeme and haue in their ſauor ought to haue, ſhould not conſiſt in getting together much goods, but in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng many ſeruaunts and frends. Great are the priuileges that the noble and lyberall men haue, for their chyldren are obedient to them, their neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors loue them, their frends doo accompaigne them, their ſeruaunts ſerue them faythfully, ſtraungers vyſyt them, and the enemies they haue, dare not ſpeak againſt them: for although they ſpight at their greatnes and fauor, yet they dare not once preſume to rebuke or reproue their lyberalyty. <hi>Phalaris</hi> the Agrigentine, <hi>Denis</hi> the Siracuſan, <hi>Catelyne</hi> the Romayn, and <hi>Iugurth</hi> the <hi>Numidian:</hi> Theſe fower famous tyraunts dyd not mayntayn their ſtates and roial kingdoms with the vertues they had, by only but force &amp; ample gifts they gaue. So that wee may well ſay, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world there is no ſtone ſo phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall, nor hand ſo liberal as treaſor &amp; riches: ſyth that in geeuing it, good men become great, &amp; tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts therby are ſupported. I would thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are princes familiars woold note wel this woord, that is, that great fauor ioined w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> much couetouſnes is a thing vnpoſſible to continew long in any. For if hee mean to keepe him ſelf in fauor, he muſt needes flye auarice: and if hee wil needes ſtick to auarice, hee muſt of neceſſitie loſe his fauor. There is no better means for hym that ſeekes the princes fauor, to get into fauor: then to ſerue him dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and to trouble him ſeldomly. The kyngs officer that ſerueth him in his houſe, muſt endeuor to make the kyng know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee ſerueth him more for the loue hee beareth him, then for any gayn or profyt he hopeth at his hands.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:333"/>
For in dooing ſo, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king wil not only w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his fauor &amp; benefits beſtowed on him, treat &amp; handle him as one hee loueth &amp; maketh account of, but alſo loue hym as if hee were his own ſonne. It is moſt iuſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beloued of the prince, loue &amp; honor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al his hart, ſence hee loueth him, &amp; needeth not. Thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are beloued, made of, &amp; fauored in princes courts, ſhould make great account of yt, &amp; therefore they ſhayld ſerue willingly. For the loue wee beare to princes, cometh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly rather of the neceſſity wee haue of them, then of our own proper willes. But the loue of princes to vs, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of meere good will, &amp; not of neceſſitie. If any man doo company mee, ſpeak to mee, &amp; ſerue mee: yt ys onely in that reſpect that I euer geeue him, &amp; for that hee hopeth I wil gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue him in tyme to come. And to ſuch a man I might truely ſay, hee rather flaterith then loueth mee. The eſteemed of the court muſt note if it pleaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that though the prince haue others about him, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee fauoreth &amp; loueth as well as him ſelf, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee bee not therefore offended nor diſpleaſed a whit. For els all thoſe hee ſeeth accepted into fauor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, hee woold make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp; becauſe they may auoid this inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, they muſt take it in very good part. For albeit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince geeue his fauor to one alone, yet hee imparteth his gifts to diuers. Thoſe that newly begun to riſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, &amp; to doo much: may not euen vpon a ſoden ſhow them ſelues to bee rich, but onely ſtudy dayly to increaſe in fauor. For euery time that the courtier dooth aſſure mee hee dooth not diminiſh in fauor, I will bee bound to him hee ſhal neuer bee poore. The way they muſt obſerue in the court to bee great, &amp; to bee able to doo is this: That is, to viſit oft, to ſuffer, to preſent to ꝑſeuer, to bee beloued, &amp; to continew in the princes fauor: Which I aſſure you, is a great ſecret, &amp; right alchimyne of court, ſodeinly to riſe in fauor, and to bee rich, &amp; al in ſhort time. By thys I inferre, that the wiſe man euer deſireth firſt to bee in fauor, before hee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet to bee rich: but the foole &amp; Ideot deſireth firſt to bee rich, &amp; then in fauor laſt. Not few but many wee haue ſeen in princes courts, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> though fortune in ſhort time hath exalted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt degree of riches &amp; made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cheefe in fauor, yet w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in ſhort ſpace after, ſhee hath made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo loſe their riches, &amp; fal from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> top of their honor. It is moſt certain, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if one haue enemies in the court, onely for that hee is infauor, hee ſhal haue as many moe, if beeing in fauor, hee bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo rich. For wee are al of ſo ill a condicion, in things that touch our particular profyt, that all that wee ſee geeuen to others, wee think ſodeinly taken away from our ſelues. Wee haue heretofore ſayd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not fit for the courtier, and thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are in fauor, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund for his profit al that hee liſt, neither al thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee may. And wee now at this preſent alſo aduiſe them to take heede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they doo not accept &amp; take al that is offered &amp; preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, although they may lawfully doo it. For if hee bee not wiſe in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, &amp; moderatin taking, a day might come y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould ſee himſelf in ſuch extremity, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee ſhould bee inforced to cal his frends not to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel him, but rather to help &amp; ſuccor him. It is true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a natural thing for a courtier that hath 20. crownes in his purſe, to deſire ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinly to multiply it to a .100. from a .100. to .200. fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 200. to a .1000. fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a .1000. to 2000. and from .2000. to 10000. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this poore wretched creature is ſo blinded in couetouſnes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee knowth not, nor feeleth not, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as this auar ce ꝯtinually increaſeth &amp; augmenteth in him, ſo his life dayly diminiſheth and decreaſeth, beeſides that that euery man mocks &amp; ſcornes him, that thinketh the true co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:21411:333"/>
much riches. For to ſay truly it is not ſo, but rather diſordinat riches troubleth &amp; greeueth the true contentacion of men, and awaketh euer in them dayly a more appetite of couetouſnes. Wee haue ſeen many courtiers rich &amp; beloued, but none in deede that euer was contented, or wearied w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> commaunding, but rather his life ſhould faile him then couetouſnes. O how many haue I ſeene in the court, whoſe legges nor feete haue ben able to cary them, nor their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtrong inough to ſtand alone, nor their hands able to wryte, nor their ſight hath ſerued them to ſee to read, nor their teeth to ſpeak, neither their iawes to eat, nor their eares to heare, nor their memory to trauaile in any ſuyt or matter, &amp; yet haue not their tongue fayled them to require preſents and gifts of the prince, neither deepe and fyne wit, to practiſe in court for his moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile and vantage. So incurable is the diſeaſe and plague of auarice, that hee that is ſick of that infirmity, can not bee healed neither with pouerty, nor yet bee remedied with riches. Sence this contagious malady and apparant dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is now ſo commonly knowen, and that it is crept into courtiers, and ſuch as are in high fauor and great autoritie by reaſon of this vile ſinne of auarice, I would counſell him rather to apply him ſelf to bee well thought of, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed, then to endeuor to haue inough.

not onely before he haue determined how hee ſhould lay out or ſpend this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but alſo before hee haue made his will. I haue many times told it to my frends, yea &amp; preached it to them in the pulpit, and wrytten yt alſo in my boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that it is farre greater trouble to ſpend the goods of this world wel, and as they ought to bee ſpent: then it is to get them. For they are gotten wyth ſwet, and ſpent with cares. Hee that hath no more then hee needeth, it is hee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knoweth wel how to part from them, &amp; to ſpend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but hee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; more then needeful, dooth neuer reſolue what hee ſhould doo. Whereof fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth many times, that thoſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> in his life time were enemies to hym, ſhall happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee heires after his death of all the goods &amp; money hee hath. It is a moſt ſuer &amp; certain cuſtome among mortal men, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> commonly thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are rych men (while they are aliue) ſpend more money vaynly in things they would not, &amp; that they haue no pleaſure in, &amp; where in they would leaſt lay it out: and after their death they leaue the moſt part of their inheritance to thoſe, whom they loued leaſt. For it happeneth many times, that the ſonne which he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued woorſt, inheryteth hys goods, and that ſonne whych hee loued beſt, and made moſt of, remayneth poore. Therefore contynuyng ſtyll our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I ſay, that I know not the cauſe why the fauored of the court deſire to bee ſo rych, couetous, and inſatiable, ſyth they alone haue to get the goods whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re afterwards to ſpend them, they haue neede of the counſell and aduiſe of many. Let not thoſe alſo that are in fauor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince, make too great a ſhew openly of their riches, but if they haue aboundaunce, let them keepe it ſecret. For if their lurking enemies know not what they haue, the woorſt they can doo, they can but murmur: but if they ſee it once, they will neuer linne til they haue accuſed him. To ſee a courtier buyld ſumptuous houſes, to furniſh them with woonderfull &amp; rich hangyngs, to vſe exceſſe &amp; prodigalitie in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, to haue their cubberds maruellouſly decked with cups, and pots of gold and ſiluer, to ſee infinit preſents brought into his houſe, and to bee greedy of mony in taking, and to haue a great trayn of ſeruants to wait vppon them: al theſe are things not onely to make them murmur &amp; repine at, but alſo whan tyme and place ſerueth, to condempne and accuſe them, to the prince. And this were but lytle to murmur at them, and accuſe them, ſo that they dyd not defame them, and diminiſh their honor and reputacion. For they tell yt abrode afterwards, eyther that they are corrupted with preſents, or that they doo robbe and ſteale from the prince their maiſter. And therefore I returne once agayn to admoniſh them, and ſpecially the officer of the court, that they ſhall not neede, neyther is it requiſit they make any oſtentacion of their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, if they bee wiſe at leaſt. For beſydes that euery body will murmur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt hym, they wyll not ſpare to bring it to the princes eares quyckly, ſo that by myſfortune yt myght happen to him, that the kyng would doo that with his ſeruaunt the hunter dooth oft with his beaſts hee taketh, that many tymes hee cheeriſheth hym and geeueth him meat to eat, not to bring him vp, but to fatte hym, and kyll him for his own eating.</p>

                     <p>Among all the noble and renowned Romains, hee onely would neuer ſuffer ſtature or Image of his, to bee ſet vp in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> high Capitol.

For yt happeneth many tymes, that thoſe whom vnconſtaunt fortune fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mean and low eſtate hath rayſed to high degree and ſteppe of honor, doo become afterwards by the ſame occaſion rather defamed, then prayſed. For there are many that are reuerenced, and honored openly, by reaſon of their honor and dignity they haue at this preſent, of whom they make a ieſtyng ſtock after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when they ſee them fall. <hi>Lucan</hi> ſayeth, that <hi>Pompeius</hi> woold ſay many tymes, whan hee would ſpeak of theſe worldly things, my frends, I can tell you a trew thyng, whereby you may know the lytle occaſion wee haue to truſt humayn felycityes. Example you may ſee in mee, whych attayned to the Romayn Empire, without any hope I had euer to come vnto yt: &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards alſo not myſtruſting any thyng, euen ſodeinly it was taken from mee, and I depryued of yt. <hi>Lucius Seneca</hi> beeing banyſhed from Rome, wrote a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his mother <hi>Albuina,</hi> in which hee did both comfort her, and him ſelf, and wrote thus. O my deere mother <hi>Albuina,</hi> I neuer in all my life beleeued or truſted vnſtable fortune, although there haue been many peaces and leagues made betwyxt her and our houſe. For if at a tyme the traytereſſe conſented that for a ſpace I ſhould bee quyet and at reſt, ſhee did it not of good wyll ſhee had to leaue to purſue mee, but to geeue mee a more cloked ſecurity. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhee ſeeth wee think our ſelues aſſured, then w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al her force &amp; fury ſhee geueth vs the aſſault, as if ſhee came to aſſault y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies camp. And I tel thee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet (good mother) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al the good ſhee wrought in mee, and the honor ſhee heaped on mee, &amp; al the faculties &amp; aboundaunce of riches ſhee brought to my houſe, ſhee told mee ſhee gaue mee them freely, but I always aunſwered her I did accept them in way of impreſt, &amp; not of gift. Her promiſſes therefore ſhe offered mee, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honor ſhee layd vpon mee, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> riches ſhee gaue mee, ſhee layd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp in ſuch a corner of my houſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eyther by day or by night ſhee might at her pleaſure when ſhe would take them al from mee, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee ſhould trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at al therefore my iudgement, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee ſhould ſorow my hart awhit. And becauſe thou ſhooldſt know how I did eſteeme of fortune, I tel thee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I euer thought it good neuer to let any thing come w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in mee, nor into my hart, but only neere vnto mee: &amp; ſo I was conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to eſteeme it, &amp; kepe it vnder good ſafty,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:335"/>
but not that I therefore applyed and gaue all my affection and mynd to yt: I was glad to haue fortune my frend, but if I loſt her, I was neuer ſory for her. Fynally I conclude, that when ſhee came to aſſault mee &amp; to robbe my houſe, ſhee might well conuey all that was put in the arke, but not that ſhee could euer cary away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt ſigh of my hart. They ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kyng <hi>Phillip</hi> father of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great beeing aduertiſed of three great victories happened in ſundry places to his army, kneeled down on both his knees, and holding hys hands vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauens ſayd. O cruell fortune, O mercifull gods, O my good luck, I beſeech you moſt humbly, that after ſo great a glory and victory as this, you haue hitherto geeuen mee: you will moderate your correction and puniſhment, which after this I looke for that you wil geeue mee, that you pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh mee with pyty, and not with vtter deſtruction and ruyn. And yet hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this furder to his woords. Not without cauſe I coniure thee O fortune, &amp; doo beeſeech you immortal gods, that you will puniſh mee fauorably, but not to vndoo mee: becauſe I am aſſured, that ouermuch felicity and proſperyty of this life, is no more but a prediction and preſage of a great calamity &amp; ill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuyng happe. Truely al the examples aboue recited are woorthy to bee noted, &amp; to bee kept always beefore the eyes of our mynd, ſith by them wee come to know, that in the proſperity of this our thrawled life there is litle to hope for, &amp; much to bee afrayd of. It is true wee are very frayle by nature, ſince we are borne fraile, wee liue frayl, and dayly wee fall into a thowſand fraylties: but yet notwithſtanding wee are not ſo frayl, but wee may if wee will reſiſt vice. And all this commeth onely, becauſe one ſort of people foloweth an other, but one reaſon ſeeldome foloweth an other. If wee fall, if wee ſtomble, if wee bee ſick, if wee break our face, are wee ſuer (that ſeruing as wee doo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world) that the world will recure &amp; remedy vs? No ſure, it is not ſo. For the remedy the world is woont to geeue to our troubles, is euer notwithſtanding grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trouble then the firſt, So that they are like to ſearing yrons, that burn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh and heale not the wound. For the world is full of guile &amp; diſceyt, &amp; ſubtill to deciue, but very ſlow to geeue vs remedy. And this wee ſee plainly. For if it perſwade vs to reuenge any iniury receyued, it dooth it only in reuenging of that, to make vs receiue a thouſand other iniuries. And if ſometimes wee think wee receiue ſome comfort of the world, of our payns and troubles of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, it afterwards ouer lodeth our mynds, with a ſea of thoughts &amp; cogitaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: So that this accurſed and flattering world maketh vs beleeue, and perſwadeth vs the right &amp; perfyt way, &amp; in the end wee are caſt vnwares in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the nettes of all wickednes, priuily layd to ſnare vs. How great ſo euer a man bee in fauor with the kyng, how noble of blood, how fyne of wyt, &amp; how ware ſo euer hee bee, let euery man bee aſſured that practiſeth in the world, hee ſhall in the end bee deceyued by him. For hee coſteth vs very deere, &amp; wee ſell our ſelues to him good cheap. I told you but litle, to tell you wee ſold our ſelues good cheap, for I ſhould haue ſayd better, in ſaying wee haue geeuen our ſelues in pray wholly to him, without receiuing any other recompence. And in deede they are very few, and rare, that haue any reward of him: &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit are they that ſerue him, without any other recompence, more then a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and vayn hope. O trayterous world, in how ſhort a time dooſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs, and afterwards with a glimſe of an eye ſodeinly dooſt put vs from
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21411:335"/>
thee, thou gladdeſt and makeſt vs ſorofull, thou calleſt vs to honor and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt vs, thou puniſheſt vs, &amp; dooſt vs a thouſand pleaſures. And fynally I ſay thou dooſt make vs ſo vile, and poyſoneſt vs with thy vile labors, that wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee, wee are yet euer with thee: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that greeues vs woorſt of all ys, that hauing the theefe in the houſe, wee goe out of the houſe to geeue him pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and make him owner. When the world knoweth one once that is proud and preſumptuous, hee procureth him honor: to another that is couetous, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to an other that is a glutton, good meats: to an other that is carnall, the commodity of women: to an other that is idle, quiet and eaſe: &amp; all thys dooth the traterous world, to the end that after as fyſh whom hee hath fed, hee may loſe the net of ſinne vpon vs to catch vs in. If wee would reſiſt the firſt temp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tacions y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world offereth vs, it is impoſſyble hee durſt ſo many times aſſault vs. For to ſay truely by our ſmall reſiſtaunce, increaſeth his ouer great auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. I woold theſe louers of this world woold but tel mee a litle, what reward or what hope they can hope of him, why they ſhould ſuffer ſo many incombers broiles and troubles as they doo. To think the world can geeue vs perpetual life, it is a mockry, and extreame madnes to hope of it. For wee ſee when life is moſt deere to vs, and that wee are lotheſt to leaue the world, then ariueth death in an vnhappy hower to ſwallow vs vp, and to depriue vs of all thys worldly felicity. To hope that the world will geeue vs aſſured mirth, this ys alſo a madnes. For the days excepted wee muſt lament, &amp; the due hours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted out to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain, alas wee ſhal ſee a ſmall ſurplus of time left, to laugh and bee meery. I can ſay no more, but exhort euery man to looke well about him what hee dooth, and that hee bee aduiſed what hee thinketh. For when wee thynk, and beleeue wee haue made peace with fortune, euen then is ſhee in battell againſt vs. And I doo aſſuredly beleeue, that that I now prepare my ſelf to ſpeak euen preſently, ſhalbee read of many, but obſerued of few: and that is, that I haue ſeene thoſe come out of their own propre houſes, moorning &amp; lamenting that had ſpent and conſumed all their time in laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and making good cheere, &amp; ſeruing this miſerable world. Which is but on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly a geeuer of al euels, a ruyn of the good, a heap of ſinne, a tyrant of vertues, a traytor of peace and warre, a ſweete water of errors, a riuer of vices, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor of the vertuous, a combe of lyes, a deuiſer of nouelties, a graue of the ignorant, a cloke of the wicked, an ouen of lechery, and fynally a <hi>Caribdis,</hi> where all good and noble harts doo periſh, and a right <hi>Silla,</hi> where all noble deſires and thoughts are caſt away togeethers. For it is moſt certayn, that this worldling, that is not content with this world, and that leaueth his fyrſt ſtate, and that taketh vppon him a new maner of life, and chaungeth from houſe to houſe, and contrey to contrey: hee ſhall neuer notwithſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him ſelf, nor quyet his mynd. And the cauſe heereof is, that if a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling depart out of his houſe, neuer to come agayn into it: there are yet at hand immediatly other tenne licentious perſons, that doo but watch to enter into his houſe. Speaking more particulerly I ſay, that in the court of pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they account them happy, and fortunat, that bee in fauor with the prince, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue great affairs in court, that bee rich and of power, that bee ſerued and honored of euery man, and that take place and goe beefore euery man. So that it may bee ſayd, that the common people doo not call thoſe fortunat, that
<pb facs="tcp:21411:336"/>
deſerue to bee fortunate: but onely thoſe that haue inough. But the auncient phyloſophers were not of this mynd, and much leſſe are the wiſe men &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men at this day: For wee ſee that in the court of prynces many rather lack fauor, then lyfe: and others lack both fauor, and lyfe togethers: and others not onely their lyfe and fauor, but alſo all their goods and faculties. So that, all that that their fauor and credit haue geeuen them in many yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and by ſundry greefes and troubles, they come afterwards to loſe them euen vppon a ſodeyn, and in ſhort time. I graunt notwithſtanding that it ys a great honor, profyt, and furtheraunce, for the courtier to bee in his princes fauor, but neuertheles hee cannot deny mee, but that it is a daungerous thing alſo. For naturally a great famyliarity, bringeth alſo a great enuy wyth yt, ſyth the beloued of the prince is commonly ill willed of the common weale. And that, that is yet moſt daungerous is, that to obtayn the ſauor of hys prince, hee muſt ſo behaue him ſelf, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſeruice muſt bee more rare, better, and exquyſite, then all others: and otherwiſe, to fall in diſgrace, and to make the prynce forget all the good ſeruice hee hath doone hym hys whole life tyme, hee neede but the leaſt diſpleaſure and fault hee can commit. <hi>Euſeni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des</hi> was maruelouſly beloued with <hi>Tolomey,</hi> who after fortune had exalted and brought him to honor, and that hee was growen to great wealth, ſayd one day to <hi>Cuſpides</hi> the phyloſopher theſe woords. O my frend <hi>Cuſpides</hi> tell mee I pray thee, of thy fayth, is there any cauſe in mee to bee ſad, ſyth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath placed mee in ſo great autoryty and honor, as ſhee can deuiſe to doo, and that the kynk <hi>Tolomey</hi> my lord hath now no more to geeue mee, he hath alredy beene ſo bountyfull to mee? To whom the philoſopher aunſwered, ſaying. O <hi>Euſenides,</hi> yf thou wert a phyloſopher, as thou art a beeloued ſeruaunt, thou wouldſt tell mee an other tale, then that thou telleſt mee now. For although kyng <hi>Tolomey</hi> hath no more to geeue thee, knowſt not thou that ſpyghtfull fortune hath power to take away from thee many thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? For the noble hart feeleth more greefe, and diſpleaſure, to come down one ſtaire, or ſtep, then to clymme vp a hundred. Not many days after theſe woords paſſed betweene <hi>Cuſpides,</hi> and <hi>Euſenides,</hi> yt happened that one day Kyng <hi>Tolomey</hi> found <hi>Euſenides</hi> talkyng w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> aleman or curteſan of hys w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> hee loued deerely, whereat hee was ſo much offended, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee made her ſtraight drink a cuppe of poyſon, and cauſed him to bee hanged before his own gates. The emperor <hi>Seuerus</hi> had one in ſo great fauor and credit which was called <hi>Plautius,</hi> &amp; hee loued hym ſo extreamely, &amp; truſted him ſo much, that hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer read letter, but <hi>Plautius</hi> muſt read it, and hee neuer graunted commiſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or lycence to any man, but it muſt paſſe vnder <hi>Plautius</hi> ſeale: neither dyd hee euer graunt any thyng, but at the requeſt of <hi>Plautius,</hi> nor dyd make war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res or peace, without the counſell and aduice of <hi>Plautius.</hi> The matter fel out ſo, that <hi>Plautius</hi> entring one night into the emperors chamber armed with a priuy cote, his yll hap was ſuch, that a litle of his breſt before was open, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby was ſpyed the mayle, which <hi>Bahhian</hi> ſeeyng, beyng the emperors el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonne ſayd vnto hym theſe woords. Tell mee <hi>Plautius,</hi> doo thoſe that are the beloued of prynces vſe to come into theyre bed chamber at theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, armed with Iron coate? I ſweare to thee by the Immortall gods, and let them ſo preſerue mee in the ſucceſſion of the Empire, that ſyth
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:21411:336"/>
thou comeſt armed with Iron, thou ſhalt alſo dye with Iron. Which preſently tooke place. For before hee went out of the chamber, they ſtrake of his head. The Emperor <hi>Comodus</hi> (that was ſonne of the good Emperor <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius</hi>) had a ſeruaunt called <hi>Cleander,</hi> a wiſe and graue man, old, and very pollytyck: but with all a litle couetous. This <hi>Cleander</hi> was oft times requeſted of the pretoryne compaigny, that is to ſay of the whole band of ſouldiours, that hee woold commaund they might bee payd their pay dew to them: and to perſwade him the better to pay it, they ſhewed him a bill ſigned from the Emperor, to which bill hee aunſwered. That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperor had nothing to doo in the matter. For although hee were lord of Rome, yet had hee not to deale in the affaires of the common weale. Theſe diſcourteous, and vnſeeme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly woords related to the emperor <hi>Comodus,</hi> and perceiuing the ſmall obedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reſpect of duty that <hi>Cleander</hi> ſhewed to him, hee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded foorth with hee ſhould bee ſlayn to his great ſhame, &amp; that all his goods ſhould bee confiſcat. <hi>Alcimenides</hi> was a great renoumed kyng among thee <hi>Greekes,</hi> as <hi>Plutark</hi> writeth of him, and hee fauored one <hi>Pannonius</hi> entierly wel, to whom only hee did not commit his perſon, his truſt, but alſo the whole affaires and dooings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the comon weale, &amp; hee might diſpoſe of the goods of the kyng, at his wil and pleaſure, without leaue or licence. So that al the ſubiects found, they had more benefit in ſeruing of <hi>Pannonius</hi> then in pleaſyng of the Kyng. Therefore the king &amp; the beloued <hi>Pannonius</hi> playing at the balle togethers, they came to contend vppon a chaſe, and the one ſayd it was thus, the other ſayd it was contrary, and as they were in this contention, the kyng commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded preſently thoſe of his gard, that in the very place of the chaſe where <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonius</hi> denied, they ſhould ſtrike of his head. <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Emperor alſo had one whom hee lyked very well, and made much of, called <hi>Hortentius,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> in deede might well bee counted a princes derling, for hee dyd not onely rule the affaires of the common weale, of the pallace, of warres, his goods, and perſon of the emperor: but alſo hee was euer placed aboue all the Imbaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours at his table. And when the emperor went in progreſſe, or any other iorny, hee euer had him to his bedfellow. Thus things beeing in this ſtate, I tel you, it happened that one day a page geeuing the emperor drink in a glaſſe, the glaſſe by myſhap fell out of the pages hand and brake in peeces, whereat y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> emperor was not a litle diſpleaſed and offended. And euen in this euil &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy hower came <hi>Hortentius</hi> to the Kyng to preſent hym certayn bylles to ſigne of haſty dyſpatch (which was a very vnapt tyme choſen) and the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror contented yet to ſigne yt, could neither the firſt nor the ſecond tyme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the penne was ill fauordly made, and the ink ſo thyck that yt would not wryte: whych made the kyng ſo angry, that euen preſently for anger hee commaunded <hi>Hortenſius</hi> head to bee ſtriken of. But to the end wee may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to the knowledge of many things in few woords, I wyll ſhew you how <hi>Alexander</hi> the great ſlew in hys choller hys deere accounted <hi>Cratherus,</hi> and <hi>Pirrhus</hi> Kyng of the <hi>Epirotes, Fabatus</hi> hys ſecretory. The Emperor <hi>Bitillion</hi> hys greateſt frend <hi>Cincinatus. Domitian</hi> the emperor, <hi>Rufus</hi> of his chamber. <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor hys onely fauored <hi>Ampromae, Diocleſian</hi> hys frend <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritius,</hi> whom hee loued as hym ſelf, and always called hym frend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignion. <hi>Diadumeus, Pamphilion</hi> hys great treaſorer. For whoſe death hee
<pb facs="tcp:21411:337"/>
was ſo ſorowfull, that hee would haue made him ſelf away, beecauſe hee cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to bee ſo cruelly ſlayn. All theſe aboue named, and infynyt others alſo, ſome were maiſters, ſome lords, ſome kyngs, and ſome of great autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and fauor about princes, by whoſe tragicall hiſtories and examples wee may plainly ſee, that they did not onely loſe their goods, fauor and credit, but alſo vpon very light occaſions were put to death by ſweord. Therefore mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men ſhould put no truſt in worldly things, ſyth that of lytle occaſion they become ſoone great, and of much leſſe they ſodeinly fall, and come to woorſe eſtate then before. And therefore kyng <hi>Demetrius</hi> aſkyng one day <hi>Euripides</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> philoſopher, what hee thought of humayn debility, and of the ſhortnes of this lyfe aunſwered. Mee thinks O Kyng <hi>Demetrius,</hi> that there is nothyng cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn nor ſuer in this vnſtable life: ſyth all men liuing, and al things alſo that ſerues them, indure dayly ſome clipſe: and hereunto replied ſodainly <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> &amp; ſayd. O my good <hi>Euripides,</hi> thou hadſt ſayd better that all things vegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, and ſenſitiue, and ech other liuing thyng dooth not onely feele the eclipſes efforce, and chaunge from day to day, but from hower to hower, and minute to minute. Meaning kyng <hi>Demetrius</hi> by theſe woords hee ſpake, that ther is nothing ſo ſtable in this world, bee it of what ſtate or condicion yt will bee, but in a twyinkling of an eye, is ready to runne into a thouſand dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils: &amp; albeit wee bee all ſubiect (of what ſtate or degree ſo euer wee bee) to ſundry &amp; diuers thrales, &amp; miſhaps, yet none are ſo neere neighbors to them, as thoſe that are in higheſt autority, and greateſt fauor with princes. For the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re are many that ſhoots to hit down the white of their fauor, but few that (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng down) will once put it vp agayn and reſtore yt to his place. For to lyue a contented life, a man had neede to want nothing: neither to haue any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to trouble him. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things that trouble vs in this vale of miſery, being ſo many and of ſuch aboundaunce, and thoſe things contrarily ſo few, &amp; rare to come by, that wee neede and want: wee may iuſtly account this life wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and myſerable aboue all others. For ſure farre greater are the greeues and dyſpleaſures wee receyue, for one onely thing wee want: then the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are great wee haue for a hundreth others, whereof wee haue aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce. Beſides that, the familiars of princes cannot think them ſelues ſo mighty and fortunat, that any man may preſume to cal them bleſſed or happy. For if ſome ſerue and honor them, others there are that perſecute them, and if in their houſes they haue that flatter them, and make much of them, there wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not in the court others that murmur at them, and ſpeak ill of them. And yf they haue cauſe ſome times to reioyce that they are in fauor: ſo haue they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe continuall trouble and feare that they ſhal fall, and bee put out of fauor: And if they glory to haue great treaſure, they ſorow alſo to haue many enemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. And if the ſeruices and company they haue doo delight them, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all buyſines they haue doo vex them: So that wee may ſay of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as of plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering of houſes, which are neuer ſo faire, but they become black with ſome ſpot in time, and woormes and other vermine do eat and waſt them. If there bee none that dare once admoniſh theſe great men in authority, and tell them their faults by woord of mouth: yet I will take vppon mee to doo yt wyth my wrytyng, and ſay, that they ſpeake nothyng but it is noted, their ſteps
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21411:337"/>
they tread are ſeene, euery morſell of meat they eat ys marked, they are accuſed for the pleaſures they take, and all thyngs that they haue are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, All the pleaſures that is doone them is regyſtred, and all ill that that they know by them is publiſhed: And fynally I conclude, that the fauored of prynces, are a game at tables, whereat euery man playeth: not wyth dyce, nor cardes, but onely with ſerpents tongues. And therefore I haue ſayd it, and once agayn I returne to ſay: That all thoſe that are accepted of pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces muſt lyue contynually very wiſely, and aduyſedly in all their dooyngs, for it is trew, and too trew, that euery mans tongue runnes of them, and much more yf they had tyme and opportunity, like as they defame them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their tongues, ſo would they offend them with their hands. Wee doo not ſpeak thys ſo much that they ſhould looke to defend their lyfe: but to foreſee that they may preſerue their honor, and goods from perill, and to geeue them by thys precept a good occaſion to looke about them. For to put them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace wyth the Kyng, all the days of theyre lyfe (to their vtter vndooyng and ouerthrow) the kyng neede but onely geeue eare to his enemies.</p>

                     <p>WHan kyng <hi>Alderick</hi> kept <hi>Seuerine</hi> the Romayn conſull priſoner, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe named <hi>Boetius:</hi> that conſull complayned much of fortune. Saying alas fortune, why haſt thou forſaken mee in my age, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce thou dyddeſt fauor mee ſo much in myne youth, and that I had ſerued thee ſo many years, why haſt thou left mee to the hands of myne enemy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. To which complaynts fortune made aunſwer thus. Thou art vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to mee O <hi>Seuerius,</hi> ſith I haue vſed my things with thee in ſuch maner, as I neuer vſed the like with any other Romayn. And that this ys trew I tell thee. Conſider, O <hi>Seuerius,</hi> that I made thee whole, and not ſick: a man and no woman: of excellent wyt and vnderſtandyng, and not groſſe and rude: rych and not poore: wyſe, and not foolyſh: free, and not bond: a Senator, and no plebeyan: noble and valyaunt, and not cowardly: a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn, and no barbarus, or ſtraunger born: in great, and not mean eſtate: a graue man, and no light nor vayn perſon: fortunat, and not vnlucky: woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of fame, and not obliuyon: to conclude I ſay, I gaue thee ſuch part in the common weale, that thou hadſt good cauſe to haue pyty of all others, and all others cauſe to haue ſpight and enuy at thee. Agayn replyed <hi>Seuerius</hi> to this aunſwer and ſayd. O cruell and ſpightfull fortune, how liberall thou art in the things thou ſpeakeſt, and reſolute in the things thou diſpoſeſt, ſith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thou dooſt what thou wilt and ſeldome that thou oughtſt. And thou knoweſt there is no ſuch myſhap, as to remember a man hath once been rich, and fortunat in his tyme: and to ſee him ſelf now brought to extreame myſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Heare fortune thou oughtſt to know yt, yf thou knoweſt yt not, that hee that neuer was rich, ſcant knoweth his pouerty. But alas for pyty, hee that
<pb facs="tcp:21411:338"/>
was rych, and had once all pleaſures and eaſe, dooth ſorrow much for the preſent extreamyty and bewayleth the forepaſſed felycity. And I tell thee alſo, and thou oughtſt to beleeue mee, that wee repute them more happy who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou neuer exalteſt nor gaueſt honor to: then wee doo thoſe whom thow haſt called to high honor, and afterwards haſt ouerthrown them, and brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght them lower, and in woorſe ſtate then before. And as for mee, O fortune, I tell thee truely, I think no man fortunat, but him that neuer knew what good fortune ment. And this was the diſcourſe betwixt fortune and the conſul <hi>Seuerius.</hi> By which wee may perceyue and comprehend, that truely none may bee thought vnfortunat and myſerable, but ſuch as haue beene beefore in great honor and reputacion: and hee cannot bee thought abaſed of his ſtate, or countenaunce, if hee were not beefore in proſperity, and fauored of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. So that wee may well ſay, that neuer no man in this world was ſo free, as hee that neuer ſuffered fortune to enter into his gates. I haue beene deſirous to tell you of theſe thyngs, becauſe that ſuch as are in fauor and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyt with prynces, ſhould not recken too much of their fauor: neyther that thoſe that are not in fauor wyth them, ſhould bee ſory for it a whyt. For the great aucthority and credyt that a man hath by the court, is in thys mortall lyfe in the end nothyng els, then as a lytle woorme in an appell, a wyuell yn the corne, and a maggot in peaſe: which wythout ſeeme very good, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are all rotten and eaten. Princes aucthority aboue all others ys moſt ſupreme, for they are not ſubiect to the Cenſors and iudges, to reprooue them of their woords and ſayings, neither to magiſtrates, to whom they ſhoold render any account of their dooings, whereof proceedes, that as they haue free will to loue, ſo haue they a free lybertie to hate, and abſolute power to punyſh. Therefore thoſe that are in fauor in court, and that ſhall read theſe writings of mine, muſt wel conſider what wee mean by all thoſe thyngs wee haue ſpoken: whereby they ſhall eaſely know, that princes are no leſſe apt to hate him to day they loued yeſterday: then to loue him to morow, whom they hated y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other day. The firſt and cheefeſt thing the courtier ought to haue, is to feare god, and to follow the profeſſion of a good chriſtyan. For in thend they lyue in court with more ſafty, hauing a good and pure conſcience: then wyth all the great credit and fauor they can haue. And therefore let euery courty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er beleeue mee, aſwell in fauor as out of fauor, that it is the beſt and ſureſt way to get the goods of this world, as alſo for the preſeruacion of their ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, to eſteeme and make account of the ſcriptures and gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And if hee doo otherwiſe, it ſhall happen many tymes vnto him, that in the diſpatch of his weightyeſt affaires, and needefull buſines, euen when hee thynks his matter brought to a good end, and that it is wythout al doubt of dyſpatch: then ſteppes in crooked fortune w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her wonted poyſon agaynſt hym &amp; eyther makes him in manner beegynne his ſuyt anew agayn, or at leaſt vtterly ouerthroweth yt quite. For there are in prynces courts many tymes certeyn ſuytes, that haue a good and better end then looked for: and contraryly many others that are at the point of diſpatchyng, and yet by ſyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter accident clean ouerthrown, and ſucceding contrary to their aſſured ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectacion. And yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it ſeemeth to the ſuter, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe hereof
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21411:338"/>
commeth, eyther through the ſoliciters negligence and default, and lyttle care to follow it, or els through the malyce and yll will of the fauored of the court, that tooke vppon hym the ſuite: and yet neyther the one, nor the other was cauſe of the diſorder, but only the diuine prouydence of God, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh vs that in all our actions and dooings it little preuayleth vs to mooue the kyng or his officers in all our matters, if wee doo not deſerue at gods hands to obtein it. And therefore ſayd the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in hys <hi>Timeon,</hi> that theſe that haue honor and proſperity in this lyfe, haue as much neede of good counſell, as the poore afflicted creatures haue, of help and remedy.</p>
                     <p>And ſurely it was wyſely and profoundly ſpoken of hym. For as neede and miſery in this wretched lyfe bringeth men to diſpair: So lykewiſe wee ſee proſperity induce men, to forgett them ſelues, and theyr ſtate. And that that I haue hytherto ſpoken of, and that I hope yet to ſpeak: none can vnderſtand nor conceiue, but ſuch as once in their tyme, in theyr nauigation had a fortunat and lucky wynd, and afterward turnyng contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, euen at ſhore ſyde haue caſt them on rockes, and vtterly periſhed them. To thend that thoſe in readyng theſe my writings, may yet lament and moorne for pity: where the other can but only read, and goe no further. If wee compare and put togeether the rych with the poore, the ſorowfull wyth the mery, the fortunat with the vnfortunat, the fauored with the banyſhed, the vertuous and noble, wyth the vycious and defamed: wee ſhall fynd without doubt the nomber of thoſe farre greater, that coold ryſe agayn bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, and had taken a fall: then thoſe that coold keepe them ſelues in the aucthority and fauor, that fortune had brought them to. I haue not ſaid it a few tymes, but euery moment I woold return to ſay it agayn, that thys trayterous world in all hys dooings is ſo deceiptfull, and Fortune in all that ſhee promyſeth ſo doubtfull, that they make them beleeue whom they make rych, beloued, and rayſe to hygh eſtate, that they doo it but to honor them: and afterwards contraryly they ſpinne a thouſand deceypts and trumpryes, to make them ſooner fall to the ground. Surely I haue ſeene but few, and I remember I haue read of none, to whom Fortune euer ſhewed herſelf ſo benygne and curteous, that euer putt a man in hys cheefeſt topp of proſperity &amp; fauor, but in few days after ſhee tooke his lyfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym, or at leaſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of his iorney ſhee made him runne into ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete diſgrace or miſhap. And therefore I woold that the courtier that obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth fauor in the court, and ryches in the common wealth, that hee ſhoold recken and eſteeme them as lent him, not geeuen him, and that hee ſhoold ſo gouern the things of fortune, as hee woold that man, whom hee truſted not at all. For as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth. No man is afficted with fortune, but hee only y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> truſted to her, without fear or ſuſpect at all of her. For courtiers and thoſe that are in great fauor and auctority ought to know, that lyke as in the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt ſeas, ſooneſt periſh the ſhippes: and as in the hygheſt mountains the Sunne hath always leaſt force and power, and as in the greeneſt bows is ſooneſt hidd the fowlers little nett, to katch the ſely byrds: And as wyth the fulleſt bayts of meat the fiſh are ſooneſt taken, and that wyth great force the wynd dooth blow on hygheſt trees, and as the moſt proud and ſtately
<pb facs="tcp:21411:339"/>
buyldings, the earthquake dooth moſt hurt, and ſooneſt ouerthrow them: euen ſo by this I mean, that Fortune neuer ſtroue to throw down any, but ſuch as ſhee had made great in honor and fauor. For I doo not take yt for no great good luck, (though all thyngs ſucceede to bee fauoured of the court better then hee looked for) nor to ſee them brought by their fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, to great eſtate and honor. For albeeit fortune for a tyme dyſſemble with him, it is not for that ſhee hath forgotten him, but afterwards to geeue him a greater puniſhment. Thoſe that will maruell at that I will ſpeak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen now, it proceedes of nothing els, but wantyng witt, and capacity to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand yt. There is no greter ſicknes in this world, then to bee in health: No greater pouerty, then neuer to haue neede of any thing. And there ys no greater temptation, then to bee neuer tempted: Nor there can bee no greater ſadnes, then to bee always mery: Nor greater daunger, then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to bee in daunger. For many tymes it ſo happeneth, that where a man thinketh to paſſe ouer a daungerous flood ſafe enough, his horſe falleth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer head and eares, and drowneth his maiſter, or hee eſcapeth hardly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Socrates</hi> beeing one day demaunded which was the moſt ſure and certayn thyng of this lyfe: aunſwered thus. There is nothing more certayn in thys lyfe, then to account all things vncertayn hee hath: nor among ryches any greater, then to haue lyfe and health: But if the lyfe bee doubtfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, what ſurety or certeinty may bee found in it? Surely none. Kyng <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> beeing requeſted of certain of his Grecian captains, to goe ſee the <hi>Olimpiade</hi> in mount <hi>Olimpus,</hi> where all the Philoſophers dyd aſſemble to diſpute, and where all the rich men of the countrey came to bye and ſell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, hee aunſwered them. If in mount <hi>Olimpus</hi> they ſold and exchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſorow for myrth, ſycknes for health, honor for infamy, and lyfe for death, I woold not only goe to ſee yt, but I woold alſo ſpend all that I am woorth, and that I haue: But ſince the byer is mortall, and the thyng alſo hee by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth condemned to death, I wil buy nothing in this lyfe, ſince I cannot carry yt with mee into my graue. Yet is there an other deceipt whych the poore courtiers falleth into dayly, and that is: that in lyuing many yeres, they thynk and aſſuredly beleeue in thend to lyght of a tyme, when they hope to haue eaſe and reſt, whych is a mockry to thynk it, and an extreme madnes to hope for yt. For if their yeres grow by ownce and ownce, their ſorows and troubles increaſe by pounds. Who can deny, but that mylk that is kept many dayes dooth corrupt and becometh ſharp and ſower? Yea the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are now very old, and haue beene long worne, (without that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer moth dyd touch it) dooth in the end alſo become rags and duſt. By this therefore I doo inferre, that if it bee a moſt certeyn thing for yong men to dye quicly, much more ſhoold old men bee aſſured that they haue no long tyme to lyue. And there are many in the court of Princes alſo, that fynd them ſelues ſo laden with ſinnes and wickednes, that they think aſſuredly, that in changing their age, tyme, and fortune, they ſhal not only leaue their vyces, but ſhalbee diſcharged alſo of many greeues and troubles. Which wee ſee afterwards happen contrary to them. For there is no way ſo playn in this world, but there is ſome aſcent or diſcent for vs to goe vp to the toppe,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:21411:339"/>
or ſome ryuer for vs to paſſe ouer, or ſome terrible mountayn to fear, or ſome crooked yll fauored way to loſe vs in, or ſome caue or hole to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Thoſe alſo that thynk certeynly that the ſunne cannot loſe hys lyght, nor that the moone can bee Eclipſed, nor that the ſtarres may bee darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that the earth ſhall not ceaſe to bring foorth, the ſeas to flow, the water to runne, the fyre to burne, and winter to bee cold, let them alſo bee aſſured, that man cannot bee excuſed to ſuffer and abyde much. For ſure it is impoſſible hee ſhoold paſſe one day without ſome trouble or ſiniſter happ of Fortune. And the greateſt trompery and deceipt that courtiers for the moſt part are abuſed in, is, that the more they wax in yeres, the more they enter dayly into greater affairs and buſines: with a vayn hope and aſſuraunce they haue to diſpatch them, and bring them to ſuch end, as they liſt or deſyre. But afterwards whan they come to looke into their matters, it is the wil of god, and their deſerts doo procure it, that the poore old men fynd (when they think to goe home to their houſes) that they ſee death approch neere them, and they afterwards are caried to bee buryed in their graues.</p>
                     <p>O how many are there in court that beecome aged men, by long ſeruing in court, wyth a vayn hope afterwards in their age to depart from the court, and to repoſe their aged yeres in their own houſes, in quiet and tranquility, which abuſeth them very much: So that they may bee called Chriſtians in name, and thoughts, but right wordlings and courtiers in dooings. And therefore many tymes I reprooued dyuers old courtiers my frends, for that they dyd not leaue the court when they myght haue left it, wyth honor, and commodity: tellyng them it was more then tyme now they ſhoold depart from the court, ſince age had ſtollen vppon them. Which coold not tell how to aunſwer mee, nor what to ſay, more then that they woold within a ſhort tyme goe home to their houſes, wyth deliberation and intent to take theyr eaſe at home, for the better health of their perſons, which they had not tyll then: and ſo to ſeclude them from all dooings, ſaue only in the morning when hee ryſeth, to goe to the church and ſerue god, and from thence to goe to the hoſpitalles, to viſite the ſick and diſeaſed, to ſeeke out the poore orphans and wydows amongſt his neighbors, to make peace betweene neyghbor and neyghbor, and to releeue the poore. And albeeit they haue told mee thys tale many a tyme and oft, yet I neuer ſaw any of them put it in execution wyth good wyll. And I ſaw once an honorable and rich courtier, that was ſo old, that for very age hee had neuer a black hear on his head, nor any teeth in hys mouth, neither any children, ſonnes, or daughters to inherit his goods, who notwithſtanding was of ſo foolyſh and fantaſticall oppinion (brought to that madnes by his ſinnes) that hee ſware to mee, that for diſcharge of his conſcience only hee woold neuer leaue or geeue vp his office hee hadd in court, to chaunge that ſeruile trade of lyfe for quiet reſt at home. Thinking aſſuredly, that enioying reſt at home in his own houſe, hee myght eaſely bee damned, and abyding the payns and ſeruyce of court, hee beleeued vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly hee ſhoold bee ſaued. Surely wee may aptly ſay, that thys old cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier was more then a dotard, and that hee had mard the call of his conſcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, ſince hee beleeued it was a charge of conſcience to depart the court.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:340"/>The a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bition to doo much, &amp; the couetouſnes to haue much, maketh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable courtiers beleeue that they haue yet tyme enough to lyue, &amp; to repent them when they will. So that in the court, thinking to lyue two yeres only in their age good men, they lyue fifty and three ſcore yeres wicked &amp; naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perſons. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Apothegmes</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Eudonius,</hi> that was Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Greekes, ſeeing <hi>Xenocrates</hi> reading one day in the vniuerſity of <hi>Athens,</hi> hee being not of thage of eyghty fyue yeres, aſked what that old ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was: &amp; it was aunſwered him, that it was one of the philoſophers of <hi>Greece,</hi> who followed vertue and ſerched to know wherein true philoſophy conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted.

If <hi>Xenocrates</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> philoſopher tell mee, that hee being now eyghty fyue yeres old, goeth to ſeeke vertue in this age, I woold thou ſhooldeſt alſo tell mee what tyme hee ſhoold haue left him to bee vertuous. And hee ſaid more ouer, in thoſe yeres that this philoſopher ys of, it were more reaſon wee ſhoold ſee him doo vertuous things, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this age to goe and ſeeke it. Truely wee may ſay the very lyke of our new courtier, that <hi>Eudonius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Xenocrates</hi> the philoſopher, the which if hee did look for other three ſcore yeres, or three ſcore yeres and tenne to bee good, what time ſhoold remain for him to prooue and ſhew that goodnes. It is no maruel at al, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old courtiers forget their natiue countrey and bringing vp, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that begat them, their frends that ſhewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fauor, &amp; the ſeruants that ſerued them: but at that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I doo not only woonder at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo it geeueth mee cauſe to ſuſpect them, is, that I ſee they forget them ſelues. So that they neuer know nor conſider that they haue to doo, till they come afterwards to bee, that they woold not bee. If the courtiers, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> in princes courts haue been rich, noble, &amp; in auctority, woold counſel with mee, or at leaſt beleeue my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they ſhoold depart from thence in time, to haue a long tyme to conſider before of death, leaſt death vnwares &amp; ſodeinly came to take executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their liues. O happy &amp; thriſe happy may wee call y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſteemed courtier, whom god hath geeuen ſo much wit &amp; knowledge to, that of him ſelf hee doo depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, before fortune hath once touched him w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> diſhonor, or layd her cruell hands vpon him. For I neuer ſaw courtier but in the end did complain of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, &amp; of their yll lyfe that they lead in court. And yet did I neuer know any perſon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> woold leaue it for any ſcruple of conſcience hee had to remain there, but peraduenture if any did depart from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, it was for ſome of theſe reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects or altogether, that is to ſay. Either that his fauor &amp; credit diminiſhed, or that his money failed him, or that ſome hath doon him diſpleaſure in the court, or that hee was driuen from the court, or that hee was denyed fauor, or that his ſyde &amp; faction hee held with, had a fal, or for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee was ſick, to get his health, hee went into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey. So that they may ſay hee rather went an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry &amp; diſpleaſed with him ſelf, then hee dyd to lament his ſinnes. If you aſk pryuatly euery courtier, you ſhal find none but will ſay hee is diſcontented w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the court, either becauſe hee is poore, or afflicted, enuyed or yll willed, or out of fauor, &amp; hee wil ſwere &amp; reſwere again that hee deſyreth nothing more in the world, then to bee diſmiſſed of this courtiers trauel &amp; painfull life. But if afterwards perchaunce a lytle wynd of fauor bee put ſtirring in the entry of his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>berdore, it wilſodeinly blow away al the good &amp; former thoughts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his mynd. And yet that, that makes mee wonder more at theſe vnconſtant
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:21411:340"/>
courtiers &amp; vnſtable brains, is, that I ſee many buyld goodly ſtately houſes in their countrey, &amp; yet they neither dwel in them, nor keep hoſpitality there. They graffe &amp; ſet trees, plant fruits, &amp; make good gardeins, and ortchyards and yet neuer go to enioy them: they puchaſe great lands and poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and neuer goe to ſee them. And they haue offices and dignities geeuen them in their countreys, but they neuer goe to exerciſe them. There they haue their frends and parents, and yet they neuer goe to talk with them. So that they had rather bee ſlaues and drudges in the court, then lords and rulers in their own countrey. Wee may iuſtly ſay that many courtiers are poore in riches, ſtraungers in their own houſes, and pilgrimes in their own countrey, and banyſhed from all their kinreds. So that if wee ſee the moſt part of theſe courtiers, bakbyte, murmure, complayn, and abhorre theſe vyces they ſee dayly committed in court. I dare aſſure you that this diſcontentation &amp; dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyking proceeds not only of theſe vyces and errors they ſee committed, as of the ſpight and enuy they haue dayly, to ſee their enemies grow in fauor and credit with the prince. For they paſſe lytle of the vyces of court, ſo they may bee in fauor as others are. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his booke <hi>de exilio</hi> ſheweth, that there was a law amongſt the <hi>Thebans,</hi> that after a man was fyfty yeres of age, if hee fell ſick, hee ſhoold not bee holpen with phiſitians. For they ſay that after a man is once aryued to that age, hee ſhoold deſire to lyue no lenger, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to haſt to his iorneys end. By theſe exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples wee may know that infancy is till vii. yeres. Childhood to .xiiii. yeres: youth, to xxv. yeres: manhod till .xl. and age, to three ſcore yeres. But once paſſed three ſcore, mee think it is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tyme to make clean the nets and to content themſelues with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fiſh they haue til now, then to goe about to put their nettes in order again to fiſh any more. I graunt that in the court of princes all may bee ſaued, and yet no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can deny mee, but that in princes courts there are mo occaſions to bee dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then ſaued. For as <hi>Cato</hi> the Cenſor ſaith, the apt occaſions bring men a deſire to doo yll, though they bee good of them ſelues. And although ſome do take vppon them and determyne to lead a godly and holy lyfe, or that they ſhew themſelues great hipocrits, yet am I aſſured notwithſtanding that they cannot keepe their tongue from murmuring, nor their hart from enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And the cauſe heereof proceedeth, for that there are very few that follow the court long, but only to enter into credit, and afterwards to waxe rich, and grow in great aucthority. Which cannot bee wythout hearing a lytle ſecrete hate and enuy againſt thoſe, that doo paſſe them in this fauor and auctority, and without ſuſpect and fear of others, which in this are their equals &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. It were a good counſel for thoſe that haue lyued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces til they bee growen old &amp; grey headed, that they ſhoold determine &amp; liue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of their yeres as good chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; not to paſſe them as courtiers, ſo that though they haue geuen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world the meal, yet they ſhoold in thend geeue the bran to Ieſus Chriſt. I know euery man deſireth to liue in princes courtz, &amp; yet they promiſe they wil not dye in court. And ſince it is ſo, mee thinks it is a great folly &amp; preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption for ſuch men to deſire to liue long in ſuch ſtate, where they woold not dy for al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gold in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. I haue liued in court many yeres, &amp; at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t I haue forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it quite: wherfore I dare boldly ſai, that if once
<pb facs="tcp:21411:341"/>
a man come to enioy a quiet life and repoſed reſt, I am aſſured hee woold for euer hate and diſlike to bee a courtier longer. But alas, like as theſe ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les courtiers remember not the lyfe to come, but only account of their vain &amp; courtly lyfe preſent, reputing that the moſt bleſſed and happy of any other: So god ſeeing their folly and fond addicted mynd to the vanity of court, to plague them with all, and ſcourge them with their own rodd, dooth graunt them no other nor better reſt, then that they only inioy in princes court, and ſo feedes them with their own humor. And therefore it is truely ſaid. That reſt &amp; contentation neuer entreth into a ſinners houſe. O you woorthy and noble courtiers, O you beloued, and fauored courtiers, I wil remember you, yea and again remember you, that you preſume not to cutt or pull of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wings of tyme, ſince you neither ſhall haue tyme nor mean to pluck one fether from him: much leſſe the leaſt knowledge how to doo it. And therefore it is ſayd. Yll cutteth the knife if the edge bee broken: and yll can hee gnaw bones that lacketh his teeth. And if it ſeeme good vnto you and mee alſo, that to day it is tyme to gather the fruit of the vyne of our youth, let vs goe now again to ſeeke it about by the means of our amendement. And if the pype or caſke wherein wee ſhoold put our wyne bee fuſty, with the malignity and peruerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our wicked dooings: Let vs ſeaſon them with new and better wyne of good and holy deſires. And now to conclude if to ſequeſter them ſelues from court, it bee a holſom counſell for courtiers: much more holſome and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it is for ſuch as bear ſway and reputation about the prince. For other cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers dayly lyue in hope to enlarge their countenaunce, and credit, &amp; to grow into fauor and auctority: but theſe darlings, and belyked of princes, are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually afrayd to fall, and vtterly to bee put out of fauor.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>TItus Liuius</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> wryteth, that the Romains had in ſuch vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thoſe men that lyued chaſt, and thoſe weomen alſo that profeſſed virgins life, that they erected ſtatures of them in the ſenat houſe, cary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them thorough the citie in tryumphant chariots, recommending them ſelues to their deuout prayers, and geeuing them great giftes and preſents: and finally adored them as gods. And this was their reaſon in that they honored them as gods: for that they being of fleſh, &amp; lyuing in fleſh, did leaue to vſe the woorks and inſtinct of the fleſh: which they held a thing more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine then humayn, <hi>Filoſtratus</hi> ſayth, that <hi>Appolonius Thianeus</hi> was borne without any payn or grief to his mother in all her trauell. And that the gods ſpake to him in his eare, that hee raiſed the dead to lyfe, healed the ſick, knew the thoughts of men, diuined of things to come, how hee was ſerued wyth princes, honored of the people, and folowed of all the philoſophers: &amp; yet they dyd not make ſo great a woonder of all theſe things ſpoken of him, as they did for that hee was neuer maried, and more ouer neuer detected with the knowledge of any woman liuing, much leſſe ſuſpected. Whileſt <hi>Carthage</hi> was enuironed with ſeege one eche ſyde, a virgin of <hi>Numidia</hi> taken priſoner, was
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:21411:341"/>
preſented to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and ſhee was very faire: which <hi>Scipio</hi> notwithſtanding woold not only not deflower, but ſet her at lyberty, and maried her very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably. Which act of his was more appriſed of the romayn writers, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was his conqueſt of <hi>Numidia,</hi> the reſtoring of Rome her liberty, the deſtruction of <hi>Charthage,</hi> the ſocour and relife geeuen to <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the enobling of his co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon wealth. For in all theſe enterpriſes, hee ſtill fought againſt others: but in the effects of the fleſh, hee fought agaynſt hym ſelfe. And therfor he muſt needs bee maruelous wiſe and of good iugement, that can ſubdew the deſiers and motions of the fleſh. For wee doo as much couet to follow theſe carnall deſiers, as wee are apt to our meate when wee are a hongred. Cruel and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are the aſſauts of the fleſh to the ſpirit, and wonderfull is the payn the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit abideth, to reſiſt the motions of the ſame, which by no meanes can bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, but by eſchewing the occaſions therof. As in brideling the deſires, puniſhing the fleſh, liuing with ſpare diet, increſing learning, geeuyng hym ſelfe to teares, and all together ſhutting the gates of our deſires. O, yf this vice of the fleſh came of abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of heate, or rage of blood, wee might ſoone remedy yt with letting our ſelues blood. Yf it wer by any ſicknes of the hart, yt ſhould bee cured by interior medecines: Yf of the lyuer, wee would refreſh it with oyntments. If of melancony humor, wee would waſh away al the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilations. If of cholex, wee would procure eſy purges. But alas it is a diſeaſe ſo farr from pitty, that it miſliketh wee ſhould call for phiſitions, and cannot abide wee ſhould offer it any remedy. It cannot bee denied but that ciuil warr is moſt greeuous and dangerous in a comon wealth: But much more perilous is that at home beetwixt the huſband and the wyfe: but moſt ieoperdious of all is, that a man hath with him ſelfe. For wee cannot recken any other our enymy, but our owne deſyers. I remember I ſaw once written in a courtiers houſe theſe woords, which truly deſerued to bee written in golden letters: and the woords were theſe.</p>
                     <q>The dredfull warrs, that I alas ſuſtaine againſt my ſelf, perforce my ſelf dooth ſtraine where blind deſier, becomes my mighty ſo the wreckfull gods, vouch ſaue it doo not ſo.</q>
                     <p>Surely hee that wrote this for his woord, mee think hee was no foole, nor euil chriſtian, ſyth hee nether ſought for mony, nor by ſlyght of wytt procured to deceyue or begyle, nether hee called his frends to help hym to withſtand his enemies, but only craued remedy, againſt his vnhoneſt and vaine deſires. And vndoubtedly hee had reaſon. For a man may eaſely abſent hym ſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his enymys, but to fly from hym ſelfe, it is an impoſſible thing. And therfor mee thinkes it is a thing more to bee lamented then writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſee that a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of corporall enymes, cannot vanquiſh and ouercome vs: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding when wee are alone, and think nothing of it, this only vice of the fleſh doth not alone make vs ſtumble, but fall downe ryte on the ground. For nether to become religious a prieſt, a fryer, nor to dwell in churches, nor to bee ſhut vp in cloyſters, to ſequeſter our ſelues from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, nor to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ſtate and condition: For all this I ſaye, I ſee none of all theſe things helpe vs mortall me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to defend vs from this vyce and ſinne, But the further wee ſeeke to fly from yt, the more danger wee find to fal in to it. And albeit to auoide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices and ſynnes it ſhall ſuffiſe vs to bee admoniſhed: yet againſt that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone of the fleſh, it behoueth vs to bee armed. For ther is no ſynne in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world
<pb facs="tcp:21411:342"/>
but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are meanes for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to auoid it: this only excepted of the fleſh, where with all wee are ouercome, and taken pryſoners. And to proue this true it is aparant, thus. Where rayneth pryde, but amongſt the potentates, where en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, but amongſt equalls? anger, but amongſt the impatient? glotony, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt gourmans: auarice, but amongeſt the rych? ſlothe, but amongeſt the idle? And yet for all theſe the ſynne of the fleſh generally raigneth in al men. And therfore, for not reſiſting this abhominable vice, wee haue ſeene Kings loſe ther Kyngdoms, noblemen ther landes, and poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: the maried wiues their auowed fayth: the religion nonnes, their profeſſed virginity: ſo that wee may compare this ſynne, to the nature and condicion of the venomus ſerpent, which beeing aliue ſtings vs, and after hee is dead, offendeth vs with his noyſome ſtink. Examples by Dauid, who for all his wiſedom could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayl againſt that ſynne: nor Salomon, for al his great knowledge: nor Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon for al his diuine bewty: nor Sampſon, with his mighty force: which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great fame they had for their renowmed vertues: yet thorough this onely defect they loſt al, acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paniyng with harlots &amp; licencious weomen.

They write alſo of <hi>Denis</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Siracuſan,</hi> that albeeit of nature hee was more cruel then the wilde beaſt, yet hee beecame in the end ſo tractable, &amp; pleaſant, by the meanes of a curtiſan his frend called <hi>Mirta,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee onely did confirme al the prouiſions, &amp; depeches, of the affaires of the weale publike, &amp; hee onely did but ordein and appoint them. And if the hiſtories written of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gothes deceyue vs not, wee fynd that <hi>Antenaricus</hi> the famous kyng of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> after hee had triumphed of Italy, &amp; that hee had made hymſelf lord of all Europe, hee beecame ſo farre in loue with a louer of his called <hi>Pincia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hee enflamed thus with loue of her, &amp; ſhee like wiſe ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with couetous deſire of his goods, in fine they agreed, that hee ſhould geeue her al the ſpoyle hee had wonne in the warres of <hi>Boetia:</hi> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhee ſhoold let him lye with her in her houſe, onely one night. <hi>Annibal</hi> made warres ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteen yeares w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the romains, &amp; in all that time hee was neuer vanquiſhed, till that hee was ouercome with the loue of a yong mayden in the City of <hi>Capua,</hi> which prooued a moſt bitter loue to him, ſith thereby it happened, that where as hee had ſo many yeares kept in ſubiection all Italy, hee now was made a ſubiect at home in his own country. <hi>Plutarke</hi> in his booke <hi>De republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> writeth, that <hi>Phalaris</hi> the tirant woold neuer graunt a man any thing hee deſired, nether euer denied any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a diſſolute woman requeſted. No ſmal, but great diſorder happened to the comon weale of Rome, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occaſion of the Emperor <hi>Calligula,</hi> who gaue but 6000. ſexterces onely to repaire the wals of Rome: &amp; gaue otherwiſe for ſurring one gown alone of his lemans, a 10000 ſexterces. By al theſe exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples aboue reſyted, wee may eaſely vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, how daungerous a thing it is for the courtier, to haue frendſhip &amp; acquaintance w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> weomen of ſo vyld a faculty. For the woman is of like quality, that a knot tyed of cords is: w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is eaſely tyed of ſundry knots, and very hardly afterwards to bee vndoon agayn. Heretofore wee haue beeſought courtiers, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fauored of princes, that they ſhoold not bee ſo liberall in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding: &amp; now once agayn wee pray them to bee ware of fornication &amp; adultry, for albeeit this ſinne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh bee not the greateſt in faut, yet is it the moſt dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous in fame. There is no King, prelat, nor knight in this world ſo vicious, and diſhoneſt of life, but woold bee glad to haue honeſt, vertuous, &amp; wel condicioned ſeruants, ſo that it is impoſſible therefore for the fauored courtier (lyuing diſhoneſtly) to conty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nue any long time in fauor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his prince. For wee haue ſeen many in prynces courts, &amp; common weales alſo, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue loſt their honor, fauor, &amp; ryches, not for any pride they ſhewed in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, nor for Enui y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had, nor for any trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure nor riches that they robbed, nor for any euel woords y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhoold ſpeak, neither for any treaſon that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted: but only thorough y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euill fame y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> went of them for hau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of naughty weome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For weomen bee of the right nature of hedgehogges, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> without ſeeing or knowing what they haue in their hart, doo not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding draw blood of vs with their pricks. And let not any man deceaue him ſelf, hoping y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if hee do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit a fault thorough y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh that it ſhallbee kept from the princes ears, or that it ſhall not bee blaſed abrode in the court. For this ſinne is of ſuch a quality, that though it may bee hidden within curteins, yet it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bee kept ſilent with tongues. How wiſe and ſlye ſo euer a woman bee, yet at all times when ſhee geeueth eare vnto mens requeſts, euen at that preſent ſhee reſolueth to impart the whole w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſome frend of hers. For theſe weomen doo glory more, to bee the frend of a courtier: then to bee a trew wife vnto their huſbands. I haue my ſelf ſeen in princes courts many weomen, very hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, courteous, piteful, pacient, charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wiſe, deuout, &amp; otherwiſe maruelous honeſt, &amp; yet amongſt al theſe I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer found any one ſecret.

world, let him hardly tell it a woman in great ſecret. I maruell how it ſhoold come to paſſe, that wee ſee dayly weomen cary vpon their heads a forreſt of heares, a coyfe, a hood, gimmeus hanging at theire eares, partleſs vpon their ſhoulders, ſmocks on their bodies, peticotes, gownes, kertels, hoſe, clokes, bardingales, hattes, cheyns, braſlets, ryngs, plumes of fethers in their hands, &amp; many other trinkets not named, all w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they cary lightly vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; think it no burden: and yet they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abide in no caſe to keepe or cary one ſecret in their breſt. Alas what pity is it to ſee theſe affected courtiers, what meanes they vſe to winne a ladyes fauor, what pleaſant purpoſes &amp; diſcours they put foorth vnto them, what bitter ſighs they let fal, what ſeruice they offer them, what iewels they geeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what caſtels in the ayre they promiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what ſorows they fayn, and what lyes they make them beleeue: &amp; theſe ſeely weo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (by nature proud, &amp; fooliſh) are w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> a few gifts ouercome, and with a few flattering woords beguyled. Now let this courtier &amp; his lady continew this mutual frendſhip between them, one, two, three, fower, or fiue years, though perhaps not fully theſe yeares complete neither many months alſo, &amp; you ſhall ſee in the end vndoubtedly a maruelous breach, &amp; hate beetwixt them. For this amorus courtier, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo dearely ſeemed to loue his lady, wil now make court a freſh to others, &amp; diſlyke that heretofore hee loued, and fly from her whom erſt hee folowed, abhorring y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee, once delyted in, miſlyking the taſt of thoſe meates that once were ſweete &amp; pleaſant to him: and cannot abide her face now, whoſe Image before hee had ingraued in his mynd. So if hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had ſpent three years ſeruice in making her his miſtris, hee ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth now ſix other yeares in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forgetting of her. And therfore theſe noble courtiers, &amp; beloued of princes, muſt beware they make not theſe yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and diſhoneſt loues como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in euery place. For the ſweete &amp; fragrant roſe w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> they ſeeke to gather, continueth ſcantly one hower: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pricks &amp; plagues of the perſing thorn, reſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teth hydden in their fleſh, their whole life time after. A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> erreth in nothing more in this world, then in taking to his charge a diſhoneſt woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For if hee will bring her w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, ſhee ſhall ſhame him, put him to an vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable charge, beſides y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his conſcience. And if afterwards hee woold put her away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, ſhee wil not depart for any thing: &amp; if hee woold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel her to it, ere ſhee depart it wilbee al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court ouer: ſo what thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs haue paſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them two alone in ſecret, ſhal afterwards bee knowen of euery man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade. And therfore wee haue not cauſeles told you, that it muſt needes bee a maruelous expence to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courtier, to bring his louer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him to the court. For hee muſt always bee at the charges to keepe a page, mayd or gentle woman to waight vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her. Hee muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hoſtice of his houſe to lodge her ſecretly, pleaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marſhal to ſeeme not to know of it, the harbinger y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee prepare him a good lodging, the page that hee bee dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; at her hand: &amp; her ſelf alſo muſt haue to liue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; charge hee ſhal bee at w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her, muſt needes farre exceede all the benefits and commodity hee hath by court. Beeſids that hee may aſſure him ſelf, that this their lewd and fond loue cannot long e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dure, neither can care alſo of her ſelf bee kept ſecret. For either his hoſtes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lodged her, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bawd that procureth their meeting, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> page that bringeth comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacions &amp; meſſenges beetwixt them, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> neighbors that ſeeth him freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe, or the ſeruant that ſhal ſuſpect him, or the mother that ſold her to hym,

in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end will beewray their ſecret practiſe &amp; frendſhip. Wherof ſpringeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diſdain, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſdayn, to defame eche other: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of extreme louers they were firſt, thei afterwards beecome mortal enemies. And therefor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiuel is not ſo hurtful to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corne, nor the locuſt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> otes, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woormes to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vines, nor maggots to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruyt, nor the moth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> garments, as the woman is to a man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> once was his frend, &amp; now become his enemy.

Truely I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tel what to ſay of this man, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it had been better for hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee had neuer been borne, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue kept co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany with ſuch vyle &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And I ſpeak but ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to ſay that the mouth &amp; ſinne are coſin germayns togethers: for by theyre effects and operations mee thinketh them ſo knyt and combined together, as the father and the ſonne: Syth burning leachery acknowlegeth none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for her mother, but onely the inſatiable and gurmand throte. And the dyuerſity of meats is but a continual &amp; importunat awaking of diſhoneſt tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ughts. Doo wee not read of ſaint Iherom, that albeit hee remayned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, burned of the ſunne, his face dryed vp and wrinckled, barefooted, and alſo bare headed, clothed with ſackcloth, his body ſcourged with bitter ſtripes, watchinge in the night, and faſting in the day, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually exerciſing his penne, and his hart in contemplacion, and yet for all this greeuous penance, hym ſelf confeſſed, that in his ſleepe hee dreamed and thought hee was among the courtiſans of Rome. And ſaint Paule the apoſtle, who was a man of rare and exquiſite knowledge, and deſerued to ſee the very ſecrets of paradiſe, neuer heretofore ſeen, trauailing in his vocation more then any other of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, did not hee get his liuing with his own ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds? and alſo went a ſoote prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching through all the world, bringyng infynit barbarous people to the fayth of chriſt, being beaten in the day tyme by others, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee was a chriſtian, and in the night tyme hee beat him ſelf for that hee was a ſinner, puniſhing the fleſh, to make it ſubiect to the ſpirit. And yet neuertheles hee ſayth alſo of hym ſelf, that hee coold not defend him ſelf from diſhoneſt thoughts, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> did euer let him to preach and pray with a quiet mynd. Saint Auſtin reciteth of him ſelf in his booke <hi>de confeſſionibus,</hi> that al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> while hee inhabited in the deſerts hee eat litle, wrote much, prayd oft, and ſharply chaſtiſed his body, with continuall faſts, and greeuous diſciplines. But yet perceauing that notwithſtanding all this his diſhoneſt thoughts ſuppreſſed hys holy deſires, hee beganne to crie with a lowd voyce thorough the deſerts, &amp; rocky hills, ſaying. O lord my god, thou commaundeſt mee to bee chaſt, but this frayle and accurſed fleſh can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer keepe yt. And therefore I humbly beſeech thee fyrſt to indue mee w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy grace to doo that thou wilt haue mee, &amp; then commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mee what ſhall pleaſe thee: otherwiſe I ſhal neuer doo yt. If therefore theſe glorious ſaints with their continuall faſts and contemplations, and extreame puniſhing of theyr bodyes, could not defend them ſelues from the burning motion of the fleſh: how ſhall wee beleeue that a company of dronkards, and gluttons, can doo yt, which neuer lynne bibbyng and eatyng. Wee may bee aſſured that the
<pb facs="tcp:21411:345"/>
leſſe wee pamper and feede our bodies with delicacy &amp; idlenes, the more wee ſhall haue them obedient, and ſubiect to our willes. For though wee ſee the fier neuer ſo great &amp; flaming, yet it quickly waſteth, &amp; is brought to aſhes, if wee leaue to put more woode vnto yt. Exceſſe is not onely vnlawful for the boddy but it is alſo occaſion of a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d dyſeaſes, both to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoule. For to ſay troth, wee haue ſeene more rych me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dye through exceſſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſity. And in my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, mee thynkes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinne of Gluttony neede not to bee other<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wiſe punyſhed by diuine iuſtice, ſyth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of yt ſelfe yt bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth penance inough. And to prooue this trew, let vs but require theſe glutto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to tel vs, vpon theyr othes, how they fynd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues in te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per beeyng ful pau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ched: &amp; they wil confeſſe to vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are worſe at eaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yf they had faſted: That their mouth is dry, their body heauy, &amp; yl diſpoſed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their head aketh, their ſtomack is colde, &amp; that their eyes are ſlepy, &amp; their bellyes ful, but yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they deſire to drink ſtyll. And therefore <hi>Diogenes Cinicus,</hi> deryding the <hi>Rodians,</hi> ſayd theſe woords. O you dronken &amp; gluttonus <hi>Rodians,</hi> tell mee I beſeech you, what occaſion mooues you to goe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, to pray to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods to geeue you health, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at al tymes, keeping ſober diet, you may keepe yt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you?

Alſo <hi>Socrates</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> philoſopher was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſay to his diſciples, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnyuerſity of <hi>Athens:</hi> Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber O you <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wel gouerned pollycies, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyue not to eat, to glut the body: but doo onely eat, to lyue &amp; ſuſtayn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body. O graue ſaiyng of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good philoſopher, &amp; I woold to god euery good chriſtian would cary this leſſon in mynd. For if wee woold but let nature alone, &amp; geeue her lyberty &amp; diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of her ſelf, ſhee is ſo honeſt, &amp; of ſuch temperau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that ſhee will not leaue to eat y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that ſhall ſuffice her, neither wil alſo trouble vs with that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is ſuperfluous. Yet an other foule offence bringeth this vice of Gluttony, &amp; that is, that many put them ſelues in ſeruice to wayt on others, not ſomuch for the ordinary fare that is commonly vſed in their houſe, as for the deſire they haue to fyll theyr bellies with dainty and ſuperfluous meats. And in eſpeciall whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they know they make any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, or feaſts for their frends, then they geeue double attendance, not conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that profeſſeth to bee a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ought to inforce himſelf neuer to engage his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for that, that his ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſual appetite incyteth him to: but onely for that that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon byndeth hym to. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> the phyloſopher, waſhyng lettyſe one day w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds for his ſupper, by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <hi>Plautus</hi> paſſing by that way, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng hym ſayd: If thou wooldſt haue ſerued Kyng <hi>Dioniſius,</hi> wee ſhould not haue ſeene thee eat lettiſes as thou dooſt now: <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered him again, O <hi>Plautus,</hi> if thou wert co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to eat of theſe lettyſes that I eat, thou ſhooldſt not ſerue ſo great a tyraunt as thou dooſt. The exceſſe of meates ys greater in theſe days, both in quantity, and in dreſſing of them, then in tymes paſt. For in that golden age, which the philoſophers neuer ceaſe to beewaile, men had no other houſes but naturall caues in the ground, and apparelled onely

When the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> returned out of <hi>Cicill</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> hee ſayd one day in his colledge. I doo aduertiſe you my diſciples, that I am returned out of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill</hi> maruelouſly troubled, and this is by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a monſter I ſaw there. And beeing aſked what mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter it was, hee told them that it was <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. who is not contented with one meale a day, but I ſaw him ſuppe many tymes in the night. O diuine <hi>Plato,</hi> if thou wert alyue as thou art dead, and preſent with vs in this our peſtilent age, as thou wert then in that golden tyme: how many ſhouldſt thou ſee, that doo not onely dyne and ſuppe wel, but beefore dinner breake their faſt with delycate meats and wynes, and banket after dynner and ſupper alſo beefore they goe to bed. So that wee may ſay, though <hi>Plato</hi> ſaw then but one tyrant ſuppe, hee might ſee now euery body both dyne and ſuppe, and ſcant one that conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth hym with one meale a day, in which the brute beſts are more moderate, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reaſonable men. Syth wee ſee that they eat but ſomuch as ſatiſfyeth them: and men are not contented to eate inough, yea till they bee full, but more then nature wyl beare. And brute beaſts haue not alſo ſuch diuerſity of meats as men haue, neither ſeruants to wayt on them, beddes to lye in, wyne to drink, houſes to put their heads in, money to ſpend, nor phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to purge them as men haue. And yet for al the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe commodities, wee ſee men the moſt part of their tyme ſick. And by theſe things recyted, wee may perceyue, that there is nothing preſerueth ſo much the health of man as labor, &amp; nothing conſumeth ſooner then reſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>tyme</hi> on ſpake a notable ſentence, and woorthy to bee had in mynd, and that is this. That in that city where there are many phiſicions, yt muſt needes follow of neceſſity that the inhabitaunts there of, are vicious, &amp; ryotous perſons. And truely wee haue good cauſe to cary this ſaying away. Sith wee ſee that phiſitions commonly enter not into poore mens houſes, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trauell and exerciſeth their body dayly: but contrarily into the rych and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy mens houſes, which lyue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually idlely, &amp; at eaſe. I remember I knew once a gentleman (a kynſman of myne, and my very frend) which hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken phyſyck, I came to ſee how hee did, ſuppoſing hee had beene ſyck, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding of him the cauſe of his purgacion: hee told mee hee tooke it not for any ſicknes hee had, but o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ely to make him haue a better appetite againſt hee we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the feaſt, which ſhould bee a two or three days after. And with in ſyxe days after I returned agayn to ſee hym, and I found him in his bedde very ſick, not for that hee had faſted too much, but that hee had inglutted hym ſelf with the variety of meats hee eat at the feaſt. So it happened, that where hee purged him ſelf once onely to haue a better ſtomack to eat, hee needed af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terwards a douzen purgacions to diſcharge his loden ſtomack of that great ſurfet hee had taken at the feaſt, with extreme eating: And for the fower ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers hee was at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table where this feaſt was, hee was lodged afterwards in his chamber for two moneths, to pay vſery for that hee had taken, &amp; yet yt was the great grace of god hee eſcaped with lyfe.

the ſynne of Gluttony is not only dangerous for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciens, hurtfull to the health of the body, and a diſpleaſing of god: but it is alſo a worme that eateth, and in fine conſumeth wholly the goods, &amp; faculties of him that vſeth yt. Beeſyds that, theſe gurmands receyue not ſo much pleaſure in the eatyng of theſe dainty morſells, as they doo afterwards greefe and diſpleaſure, to heare the great accounts of their ſtewards, of their exceſſyue expenſis. Yt is a ſwete delight to bee fed daily with dainty diſhes, but a ſower ſawce to thoſe delicat mouthes to put his hand ſo oft to the purſe. Which I ſpeake not with out cauſe, ſyth that as wee feele great pleaſure and felicity in thoſe meates that enter into our ſtomack, ſo doo wee afterwards think that they pluck out of our hart that mony that payeth for thoſe knacks. I remember I ſaw wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in an Inne in <hi>Catalogia</hi> theſe woords. You that hoſte heere muſt ſay, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you ſit down to your meat, <hi>Salue regina,</hi> yea &amp; when you are eating, <hi>Vitae dul cedo,</hi> yea and when you recken with the hoſt, <hi>Ad te Suſpiramus,</hi> yea and when you come to pay him, <hi>Gementes, &amp; flentes.</hi> Now yf I would go about to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe by parcells the order and maner of our feaſts and banckets, newly in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uented by our owne nation, there would rather appeare matter to you, to lament and bewaile, then to write. And it had been better (by way of ſpeach) to haue inuented dyuers faſhions of tables, formes, and ſtooles, to ſit on, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch diuerſity of meates to ſet vpon the tables, as wee doo vſe now a dayes.</p>
                     <p>And therefore by good reaſon did <hi>Licurgus</hi> (King of <hi>Lacedemonia</hi>) ordeyne &amp; comaund, that no ſtranger comming out of a ſtrange country into his, ſhould ſo hardy bring in any newe cuſtomes vpon pain, that if it were knowen, hee ſhould bee ſtreight baniſhed out of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, and if hee did vſe and practiſe yt, hee ſhould bee put to death. I will tell you no lye. I ſaw once ſerued in at a feaſt xlii. ſortes and kyndes of meates in ſeuerall diſhes: In an other feaſt of diuers ſortes of the fiſh caled Tuny. And in an other feaſt, beeing fleſh day, I ſaw dyuers fiſhes broyled with lard. And at an other feaſt wheare I ſaw no other meate but Troutes, and Lampereis of dyuers kyndes of dreſſinge. And at an other feaſt, wheare I ſaw only, vi. perſons agree togethers to drink ech of them .iii. pottels of wyne apeece, with this condition further, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould bee .vi. howers at the table, and hee that drank not out his part, ſhould pay for the whole feaſt. I ſaw alſo an other feaſt, where they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared iii. ſeuerall tables for the bidden gueſts, the one boord ſerued after the Spaniſh maner, the other after the Italian, and the third after the faſſhion of Flaunders: And to euery table there was ſerued xxii. ſortes of meates. I ſaw alſo at an other feaſt ſuch kyndes of meates eaten, as are wont to bee ſeene, but not eaten: as a Horſe roſted, a Cat in gely, litel Lyſars with whot broth, Frogges fryed, and dyuers other ſorts of meates which I ſaw them eate, but I neuer knew what they weare till they weare eaten. And for gods ſake what is hee that ſhall reade our writings, and ſee that that is comonly eaten in feaſtes now adayes, that it will not in maner breake his hart, and water his plants. The only ſpices that haue been brought out of Calicut, and the maner of furniſhing of our boords brought out of Fraunce, hath diſtroied our nation vtterly. For in the old tyme, they had no other kinds of ſpice in Spaine, but Saffron, Comyn, Garlick, and Onyons, and when one frend inuyted an other, they had but a peece of beefe, and a peece of veale, &amp; no

I ſay that it is a diſpleaſure: for the great care they haue continually to ſeeke out diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſityes of fine and curious meates: great peril, becauſe they plo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge their bodyes into many diſeaſes: and in vnmercifull charge, for the curioſity and nombers of diſhes. So that for a litel pleaſure, &amp; delight, wee take in the ſweete taſt of thoſe deinty meates, beeing but a ſatiſfaction to the mind for a ſhort tyme: wee afterwards haue infinite greefes, and trobles, with a ſower ſawce, to oure no ſmal payne. And therfor <hi>Ariſtotell</hi> mocking the <hi>Epicuriens</hi> ſayd, that they vpon a tyme went all into the temple togethers, beſeeching the gods they would geeue them necks as long as the cranes and herens, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and taſt of the meates ſhould bee more long, beefore yt came into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mack, to take the greater delight of their meate, complayning of nature that ſhee had made their necks to ſhort: affirming that the only pleaſure of meats co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſted in the ſwallowing of yt downe, which they ſayd was to ſoone. Yf wee ſaw a man euen vpon a ſodein throw al his goods into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea or riuer, would wee not imagine hee were mad, or a very foole? Yes vndoutedly. Euen ſuch a one is hee that prodigally ſpendith al his goods in feaſting and bancketing. And that this is true: doo wee not ſee manifeſtly that all theſe meates that are ſerued to noble me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s boordes to day, and to morrow co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueighid into the pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uy from the eaters by their page or ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Suerly mans ſtomack is nothing els but a gutt or tripe forſed with meate, bread, and wyne, a paueme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fyld with wyne lees, and a veſſel of ſtincking oyle, a recepit of corrupt ayre, a ſynke of a kitchin, and a ſecret place, wherinto wee caſt all our goods and faculty as into the ryuer. And therfore <hi>Eſay</hi> ſayd, that all theſe noble cityes of <hi>Sodome,</hi>
                           <pb n="164" facs="tcp:21411:347"/>
and <hi>Gomorra,</hi> by this only curſe did incurre into ſuch execrable ſinnes, for w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> afterwards they were diſtroied: and this was euen through exceſſe of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and drinking, and to much ydlenes: and it is no maruel. For it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible thing, that where ydlenes and glottony reigneth, there muſt needes come ſome yll end to that man. The Greekes, the Romans, the Egiptians, &amp; the Scithes, although they were detected of many other ſinnes and vices, yet were they alwais ſober &amp; temperat in eating &amp; drinking. <hi>Iuſtin</hi> that wrot of <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> reciteth, that among the <hi>Scithes</hi> (w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> were the rudeſt and moſt barbarous that came into <hi>Aſia</hi>) vſed to reproue thoſe that let go wind, &amp; to chaſtiſe &amp; puniſh thoſe that vomited, ſaying that breaking wynd &amp; vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, came only of too much eating &amp; drinking. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his <hi>Apothegmes</hi> ſayd, that there was a philoſopher in <hi>Athens</hi> called <hi>Hyppomachus,</hi> that was ſo great an enemy to Gluttony, that hee vſed in his colledge ſuch &amp; ſo great an abſtinence, that his diſciples by that were knowen amongſt all the other phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers. And not for no other thing, but to ſee them buy their cates &amp; proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to lyue with all: for they neuer bought meats to fatt them &amp; keepe them luſty, but only to ſuſteyn nature, &amp; that but lyttle. The Romains made dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers lawes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old tyme to expell out of their cities dronkards &amp; Gluttons, whereof wee wil recite ſome vnto you, to thend that thoſe that ſhall read our preſent writings, ſhall both know, and ſee what great care our forfathers tooke to aboliſh this horible vyce of gluttony. Firſt ther was a law in Rome called <hi>Fabian</hi> law, ſo called, becauſe <hi>Fabian</hi> the conſull made it, in which it was prohibited that no man ſhoold ſo hardy in the greateſt feaſt hee made, ſpend aboue a hundred ſexterſes, which might bee in value a hundred peeces of .vi. pence, ſalets &amp; all other kynds of fruit not compryſed within the ſame.</p>
                        <p>And immediatly after that, came out an other law called <hi>Meſſinia,</hi> which the conſull <hi>Meſſinius</hi> made. By which they were alſo inhibited in all feaſtes to drink no ſtrange wynes, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> only were permitted to bee geeuen to thoſe that were diſſeaſed. After which folowed alſo an other law <hi>Licinia,</hi> made by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull <hi>Licinius,</hi> forbidding in all feaſts all kinds of ſawces, beecauſe they incite appetit, &amp; are cauſe of a great expence. An other law <hi>Emillia,</hi> of <hi>Emilius</hi> the conſull alſo, commaunding the Romains ſhoold bee ſerued in their bankets but only w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fyue ſorts of diuerſities of meats, becauſe in them there ſhoold be ſufficient for honeſt refection, &amp; no ſuperfluity to fill the belly. And then was there the law <hi>Ancia</hi> made by <hi>Ancius</hi> the conſull, charging al the Romains to indeuour to learn all kynd of ſciences, except cookry. For according to their ſaying, in that houſe where there was a cooke, thoſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſe became poore quickly, their bodyes diſeaſed, their mynds vitious, and altogeether geeuen to Gluttony. After this law there came forth an other called <hi>Iulia,</hi> of <hi>Iulius Ceſar,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding all romains, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> none ſhoold bee ſo hardy to ſhut their gates when they were at dinner, and it was to this end, that the cenſors of the city might haue eaſy acceſſe into their houſes at meal tyme, to ſee if theyr ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry were reſpondent to their ability. And there was alſo an other law made afterwards called <hi>Ariſtimia,</hi> of <hi>Ariſtmius</hi> the conſull, by which it was enacted that it ſhoold bee lawfull for euery man to inuite his frends to dinner to hym at noone, as they liked, prouided that they ſupped not together y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> night. And this was eſtabliſhed thus, to cut of the great charge they were at with theyr
<pb facs="tcp:21411:348"/>
ſuppers: For the Romayns exceeded in ſuperfluity of daynty &amp; fyne meats, and more ouer they ſat to long gulling &amp; eating at their ſuppers. Of all theſe laws heretofore recited, were auctors <hi>Aulus Gelius,</hi> and <hi>Macrobius.</hi> And for this was <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi> well reputed of, of the Romays, who not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hee had been conſull indyuers prouinces (and that many tymes) &amp; was a man of great grauity &amp; auctority in Rome, yet hee woold neuer keepe cook in his houſe, but when hee was at Rome, his wife was his only cooke: &amp; tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueling, his hoſteſſe of his houſe where hee lay dreſſed hys meat. <hi>Marcus Mantius</hi> in tymes paſt, made a book of dyuers ways how to dreſſe meat, and an other of the taſtes, ſawces, &amp; diuers maners of ſeruing of them in at the bankets, and a third book how to couer the table, ſett the ſtools in order, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cubberd, &amp; alſo how ſeruants ſhoold wayt &amp; geeue their attendance at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table: which three bookes were no ſooner imprinted and publiſhed, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently &amp; publikly they were burned by the ſenat of Rome, and if his aucthor had not quickly voided Rome, &amp; fled into <hi>Aſia,</hi> hee had acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyed his books in the fyer. The auncient writers neuer ſeaſed to reproue enough <hi>Lentulus, Ceſar, Scilla, Sceuola,</hi> and <hi>Emilius:</hi> For a banket they made in a gardein of Rome, where they eat no other meats but black byrds, torteiſes, mallard, nettles, pigs brayns, and hares in ſawce. But yf the Romain writers wrot in theſe days. I doo not beleeue they woold reproue ſo ſimple a banket made by ſo noble &amp; famous perſons as they were. For now a days they doo ſo farre exceed in variety of diſhes at noble mens bourds, that neither they haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to eat, nor yet they can tell the names of the diſhes. But now retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to our purpoſe, I ſay the intent why wee haue layd beefore you theſe forepaſſed examples, was only to this end, to admoniſh the fauored of princes to looke into them ſelues y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they auoyd this fylthy ſinne of gluttony, Beeing a foul blott in a courtier, to bee counted a greedy gutt, &amp; Carmarant at hys meat, &amp; being one, whoſe maners &amp; behauior euery man marketh. For ſure it is more ſitting for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee moderat &amp; ſober, in eating &amp; drinking then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp; good reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why. For as they are more noble then others, ſo haue thei many that ſue vnto them, &amp; they haue alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> weightieſt matters of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, paſſing vnder their charge: by reaſon where of if they ſurcharge them ſelues w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> exceſſe, they are then very vnapt to diſpatch any matters: for much eating cauſeth ſleepe, &amp; much drinking depriueth them of their iudgement, &amp; ſences both. Is it not to be wondered at, yea &amp; to bee reprooued alſo, to ſee a magiſtrat or counceller ſet in his chair to heere poor mens cauſes &amp; ſutes, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuter opening his cauſe vnto him, hee ſitteth nodding w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his head in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom redy to ſleepe? Euen ſo doo I ſay like wiſe, that it is a great reproch to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beloued of the prince, &amp; great damage to the comon wealth, that it ſhoold bee ſpoken amongſt courtiers &amp; ſuters, that to day hee was of this opinion, &amp; to morow hee is of an other. So that the courtier or ſuter ſhoold haue hope to diſpatch that to morow, hee coold not doo to day. King <hi>Phillip,</hi> father of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great, although hee was a prince, noble &amp; fortunat, yet was hee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; rebuked for drinking of wyne, wherof folowed that after hee had geuen iudgement vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a tyme againſt a poor wydow woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhee anſwered ſtreight ſhee appealed. The noble men that were preſent, heering what was ſaid by the king, aſked her to whom ſhee woold appele, ſince y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king in perſon gaue
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:21411:348"/>
ſentence of her, &amp; no other: And this was her anſwer ſhee made them. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to king <hi>Philip</hi> w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is now dronk: that when hee is ſober, hee returne to geeue ſentence. And as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hiſtoriographers ſay, that writeth this hiſtory, thys poore woman was not deceiued in her appellation at all: for after King <hi>Philip</hi> had repoſed &amp; ſlept a little, hee reuoked &amp; repealed that ſentence that hee had before geeuen againſt her. And therefore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this matter, I ſay, that how wyld or tame ſo euer a beaſt bee, hee ſtill continueth a beaſt in his kind, only man except, who very oft through too much exceſſe of meat and drynk, ſtrayeth ſo farre from reaſon, forgetting him ſelf, that neither he him ſelf, nor any other knoweth wel, whether hee bee then a man, or a beaſt. Thoſe that are the fauored of princes muſt bee very circumſpect, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they bee not too ſump<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuous, &amp; prodigall, in their feaſts &amp; bankets, for that they haue many eyes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of them. And ſome will ſay, that they make not theſe great feaſts of them ſelues, but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gyfts &amp; preſents of others: others will not ſtick to ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they make it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that they haue robbed of others. I wiſh them in this caſe that they ſhoold not hope to excuſe themſelues by ſaying that they only feaſt their kinſfolks, &amp; familier frends. For the enuy that comonly one beareth againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power &amp; auctority of a man, is ſo great, &amp; extreme, that it ſpareth not fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, remembreth not kinſfolks, neither maketh account of the benefits receyued: but rather aſſoon as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bidden gueſts are departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his houſe that bad the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they goe talking among them ſelues, &amp; murmuring amongſt others, ſaying many tymes that it is more woorth, that is loſt by the vayn &amp; lauiſh expences of the fauored courtier: then that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſerued to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes own boord. Alſo I counſell the belyked of princes, that they take heede whom they truſt, &amp; whom they inuite to their tables. For many tymes if they bee but fower y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are bidden, one of them ſure goeth to eat &amp; banket, &amp; the other three to fleere, &amp; mock, &amp; to mark all that is brought in, &amp; the maner of the ſeruyce. And the woorſt is yet, that hee ſhall many tymes bring ſuch to eat w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, that woold more willingly eat his fleſh, then his meat. Theſe reputed courtiers muſt be wel aduiſed, that though they be too delicat &amp; ſuperfluous in their meats, yet at leaſt that they bridle their tongues. For they may bee aſſured, that as their gueſts they bad goe full paunched from them, ſo cary they away with them, all the ſuperfluous &amp; vayn woords they hard at the table. Beſydes that, that what ſo euer the courtier ſaid at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boord, reporting it otherwhere, they wyll not ſay that hee ſpake yt of him ſelf, but that the king him ſelf told it him. And yet is there a farre greater danger &amp; peril then this wee haue ſpoken of, and that is: that they will not ſimply tell that they hard of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beloued courtier, but will adde to it of their own heads, what they think beſt, &amp; what was his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſpeaking of it. So that wee may ſay, that ther are not ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vppon the byble, as they make gloſes vpon the ſame reports (by their raſh iudgements and fond interpretacions) which they did deſcant, vpon one only woord ſpoken vnwares perhaps, by ſome at the table of this fauored courtier. It is a general cuſtom, amongſt all eſtates &amp; conditions of people: that where there are ſumptuous tables, and aboundaunce of diſhes, there the inuyted ſitt long at their meat, &amp; are liberall to ſpeak euill. Which ſure ſuch as are in fauor with the prince, neither ought to doo, nor ſuffer it to bee doon by others at his boord. For the good and honorable feaſt, ought only to bee ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:349"/>
with good and dainty meats: but in no wiſe marred with the defaming of his neighbor. O how many feaſts &amp; bankets are made in princes courts, where without all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon there are more detractions vſed of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, then there are diuerſities of diſhes to eat. A pernitious thing doubtles, and not to bee ſuffered nor abidden: For no man hurteth the reputation of an other with his tongue, but with the ſelf ſame hee condemneth his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: and therefore let men bee aduyſed of their ſpech, and what they ſpeak of others. For it is alwais an eaſy matter to detract and hinder the fame and reputation of a man, but very hard afterwards to ſatiſfy the party. Therfore I councell, &amp; admoniſh theſe courtiers, that they doo not oft feaſt others: but alſo that they doo not accept to goe to others tables where they are bidden.</p>
                        <p>For they may bee aſſured, that they are beloued of few, and hated of all: and beſides that it might ſo happen, that others ſhoold bee at the charge of the feaſt, and that they ſhoold loſe their lyues. Alſo let not the fauored courtyer truſt thoſe to much, that come ordinarily to his table, &amp; that doo rebydd him again to theirs, yea though they ſeeme euen to bee wholly his to diſpoſe, and poſſible as it were his right hand, &amp; that they be thoſe whom hee happely too hath doone much for, in diſpatching their affairs. For lightly in ſuch lyke feaſts, treaſons &amp; poiſonings are not practiſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the maiſter of the feaſt, but only with him that waiteth at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table to geeue drink, or els by the cooks that dreſſeth the meat. Alſo let not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courtier truſt too much thoſe whom hee hath been in company with all at dyuers feaſts (where hee neuer had hurt) much leſſe knew any little occaſion to ſuſpect yll of them, touching any treſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment towards him. For ſo at a tyme when hee ſuſpecteth leaſt, hee may be in moſt daunger, &amp; find him ſelf deceiued. And therefore by my councell hee ſhall not eaſely bee intreated to euery mans boord, vnleſſe hee bee firſt well aſſured of the company that are bidden as alſo of the ſeruants that wayt. For the holes &amp; ſpaces of the french rydles (with which they duſt their corne) ſometimes is euen ſtopped with the very graines of the ſame corne, and letteth the cleere paſſage of all the reſt. One of the greateſt troubles (or to terme it better) one of the greateſt daungers I ſee the fauored courtiers in, is this: that al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and in maner all the citizens, deſire to ſee them out of fauor, or dead, by ſome means. For euery man is of this mynd, that with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chaunge of things, by his fall or death hee hopeth hee ſhal riſe, to ſome better ſtate, or happely to catch ſome part of his offices, or lyuings. An other miſchief &amp; inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce yet happeneth to this fauored courtier, by haunting others tables, &amp; that is: that many times it chaunceth, vnſeemly &amp; vnhoneſt woords are let fall at the table, &amp; perhaps quarel riſe vppon it, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> though hee bee preſent, yet hee can neither remedy, nor appeaſe it. And becauſe theſe things were done &amp; ſpoken in the preſence of the eſteemed of the prince, hee that ſpake them hath credit, and thoſe that hard it diſcried it. Yet ys there an other diſorder that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by theſe feaſts, that is, that hee that maketh the feaſt, and biddeth gueſts, dooth it not for that they are of hys acquayntaunce, his kinſfolks, or his faithfull frends, nor for that hee is bound and beeholding to them, but only to obtayn his deſyre in his ſutes that hee hath in hand: for they are few that ſeeke to pleaſure men, but in hope to bee greatly recompenced.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="166" facs="tcp:21411:349"/>Therefore thoſe that are in fauor &amp; auctority about the prince, &amp; that accept others bydding, ſure one of theſe two things muſt happen to them. Eyther that hee muſt diſpatch his buſynes that inuyteth him, yea although it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, &amp; ſo vniuſt &amp; damnable, that obtaining it, both hee &amp; the fauored courtier goe to the deuyll togeethers for company, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrong &amp; iniury they haue doone to an other: or on the other ſyde refuſing to doo it, the bydder is ſtricken dead, &amp; repenteth his coſt beſtowed vpon him. Aboue all things, I chiefly admoniſh the courtiers, and officers of princes, not to ſell change, nor engage their liberties as they doo, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame day that they begin to follow ſuch feaſts, or to receiue gyfts or preſents, or to lynk them ſelues in ſtreight frend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip with any, or to deal parcially in any cauſe. For by theſe foreſaid occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they ſhall oft bynd them ſelues to doo that that ſhal not bee fitt for them, beſydes the loſſe of their liberty they had beefore, to doo that was moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and commendable.</p>

                        <hi>ANaxagoras</hi> the philoſopher, diſputing one day of the cauſe why nature had placed the members of mans body in ſuch order as they are, and of the property and complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery one of them, and to what end they had been ſo orderly placed by nature, eche member in his place: falling in the end to treat of the tong, ſaid thus of it. You muſt vnderſtand my good diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that not without art &amp; grete miſtery nature gaue vs ii. feete, ii. hands .ii. eares, &amp; ii. eyes, &amp; yet for all this but one tongue, whereby ſhee ſhewed vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> in our going, feeling, ſmelling, hearing, and ſeeing, wee may bee as long as wee will: but in ſpeking wee ſhoold bee as ſparing, &amp; ſcant, as coold bee: alle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ging further that not without great reaſon alſo nature ſuffered vs to goe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen &amp; bare faced, the eyes, the eares, the hands, the feete, &amp; other parts of the body bare alſo, except the tongue, which ſhee hath enuironed with lawes, &amp; inured with teeth, and alſo ſhut with lips: w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſhee did, to geeue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there is nothing in this preſent life that hath more neede of gard, &amp; defence, then hath this our vnbrydled tong. And therefore ſaid <hi>Pithachus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> philoſopher, that a mans tong is made, lyke the yron poynt of a launce, can but yet that it was more daungerous then that: For the point of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> launce can but hurt the fleſh: but the tongue perſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart. And truely it was a true ſaying of this philoſopher. For I know not that man how vertuous or pacient ſo euer hee bee, but thinks yt leſſe hurt, the bloody ſwoord ſhoold perce his fleſh, then that hee ſhoold bee touched in honor, with the venimous point of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentyen tong.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. We ſee men refuſe to goe by water for fear of drowning: not to come too neere the fyer, for fear of burning: not to goe to the warres, for fear of killing: to eat no yll meats, for being ſick: to clym vp a high, for fear of falling: to goe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dark, for fear of ſtumbling: to auoid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yll ayer, &amp; rayn, for fear of rewmes: and yet I ſee very few, or none, that can beware of detractors, &amp; yll tongs. And that this is true I tell you, I doo not think that in any thing a man is
<pb facs="tcp:21411:350"/>
in ſuch perill and daunger, as when hee lyueth accompanyed with men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt in their dooings, and vyle and naught in their tongues. I haue alſo read touching this matter, that <hi>Aformius</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> philoſopher, being aſked what he ment to goe the moſt part of his tyme amongſt the deſert mountains, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſard euery hower to bee deuoured of wyld beaſts, anſwered thus. Wild beaſts haue no other weapons to hurt mee, but their horns &amp; nayls, &amp; their teeth to deuour mee: but men neuer ceaſe to hurt, and offend mee, with al their whole members. And that this is true, behold I pray you how they looke at mee w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their eyes, ſpurne mee with their feete, torment mee with their hands, hate mee with their hart, and defame mee with their tongue. So that wee haue great reaſon to ſay, that a man lyueth with more ſecurity, amongſt wyld beaſts: then among malignaunt and enuious people. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in his booke <hi>De exilio</hi> ſaith, that the Lydians had a law, that as they ſent the condemned murtherers to row in the gallyes, ſo they confyned thoſe that were detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and yll tongued men, into a ſecrete place (farre of from all company) the ſpace of half a yere. Inſo much as many tymes theſe lewd mates choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to row in the galley iii. yeres, then to bee exempt from company, and ſpeaking with any, but ſyx moneths. Much lyke vnto this law dyd <hi>Tiberius</hi> the emperor make an other, and condemned a great talker and rayler of hys tongue, and commaunded ſtraightly that hee ſhoold neuer ſpeak woord, the ſpace of a whole yere. And as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hiſtory ſaith, hee remayned domme, &amp; neuer ſpake during the whole terme: but yet that hee did (with his domnes) more hurt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nods, &amp; ſignes with his fingers: then many other woold haue doon with their yll tongues. By theſe two exaumples wee may ſee, that ſith theſe naughty tongs are not to bee repreſſed by ſylence, in ſecret, nor to entreat them as frends, nor by doing them good, nor by ſending them to galleys, nor to make them hold their peace, and to bee as domme men: by my aduyce, I woold haue them baniſhed (by generall counſell) out of al colleges, counſels, chapters, townes and common wealths.

Whereuppon all the Athenians one day aſſembled in their hall, or common houſe, &amp; there they appointed him a great ſtipend of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goods of the common wealth, telling him that they gaue him this, not that hee ſhoold read, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſhoold hold his peace.

O what a happy good turn were it for the common weale, if (as they haue in al townes &amp; well gouerned policies penal laws prohibiting to weare or cary weapon) they had like laws alſo to puniſh detractiue &amp; wicked to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gues. Surely there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bee none ſo great a blot or vice in a noble man, knight, or gentleman of honeſt behauior &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as to bee counted &amp; reputed a tatler of his tongue, &amp; there w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>al a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracter of others. But let not ſuch deceiue them ſelues, thinking y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for theyre countenaunce or eſtates ſake they bee priuileged aboue others, at their willes and pleaſure to enlarge their tongues on whom they liſt in ſuch manner, but that their inferiors farre, will as liberally ſpeak of them, yea and aſmuch to their reproche, as they before had doone of them: reputing aſmuch of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and credit for their calling (being inequiualent in eſtate or degree to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) as they doo of their dignitie &amp; reputacion. At that tyme when I was a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, and lyued in princes court, there dyed out of the court a woorthy knight, who at his noble funeralls was recommended of vs all, and prayſed in hys lyfe to bee a noble, valyaunt, woorthy, and wiſe man, and a good and deuout chriſtian, &amp; cheefely aboue all his noble &amp; heroycall vertues, hee was only landed and renowmed, for that they neuer hard him ſpeak ill of any man. So one of the company that was preſent, hearing this great prayſe of him, tooke vpon him to ſay this of him. If hee neuer ſpake ill of any, then did hee neuer know what pleaſure thoſe haue that ſpeak ill of their enemies. Which woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des when wee hard, though wee paſſed them ouer with ſilence, yet was there none but was greatly offended at them, and good cauſe why. For to ſay true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the firſt degree of malignitie is, for a man to take a felicyty in ſpeakyng ill of his neighbor. Kyng <hi>Darius</hi> being at dinner one day, there were put foorth of the weighters and ſtanders by, certayn arguments of the acts and doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great: in whych diſpute, one <hi>Mignus</hi> (a Captayn of the kynge, and greatly in fauor with him) was very earneſt againſt <hi>Alexander,</hi> &amp; went too farre in ſpeach of him. But <hi>Darius</hi> perceiuing him thus paſſioned ſayd to him: O <hi>Mignus</hi> hold thy tong, for I doo not bring thee into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warrs with mee that thou ſhouldſt infame <hi>Alexander,</hi> (and touch his honor with thy tongue, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou ſhouldſt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy ſweord ouercome him, By theſe examples,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:351"/>
wee may gather, how much wee ought to hate detraction, &amp; ill ſpeaking, ſyns wee ſee that the very enemies the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues can not abide, to here their enemies ill ſpoken of in their preſence: and this is always obſerued of the honorable, graue, and wiſe men that are of noble mynds. For ſuer ech noble hart dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daigneth to bee reuenged of his enemy wyth his tongue, for his iniures doon hym: if hee cannot bee reuenged on him with his ſweord. It is ſyttyng for all in generally to bee modeſt, and honeſt in their ſpeach, but much more yt is dew for hym that embraceth the fauor and credit of his prince. For it is hys profeſſion to doo good, to help euery man and to ſpeak ill of no man. They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſuch Centinells of ſpies vpon them continually (which are officers in court and about the prince) to mark what they ſpeak and doo, that treading once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry (how litle ſo euer it bee) it is ſtraight blowen into the princes eares, and they perhaps accuſed of that that they neuer thought, delyghtyng and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng great pleaſure to tell openly what they hard them ſay. Such therefore as are dayly courtiers, attendyng vppon the prince, and infauor wyth him, muſt (if they mean to continew that fauor and credit) bee gentle, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in their woords, and bountifull to thoſe that ſtand in neede of them. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the eſteemed courtier muſt beeware hee doo not onely ſpeak ill of no man, but alſo that hee be not too great a talker. For commonly theſe great talkers beſides that they are not eſteemed, bee alſo reputed of ſmall iudgement, and of ſimple counſell. <hi>Pithias,</hi> that was the great gouerner, and Duke of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> nation, was a noble prince, beloued and feared, hardy and valyaunt, and yet in the end as ſayth <hi>Plutark,</hi> the aboundaunce of woords, obſcured the glory of his heroicall deedes. Although theſe great talkers, and men too full of woords, bee of noble byrth or woorſhip, wealthy in poſſeſſions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe of auctority and eſtimacion, yet neuertheleſſe all that time they ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in ſpeaking too much, others that here them, occupye the ſame in deriding &amp; ſcornyng of them. I beſeech you what greater reproche could a courtyer ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, then to bee called a babbler a prater of his tongue, and a lyer? For when hee thynks euery man is attentiue, and liſtening to hym, it is quyte contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for euen at that inſtant doo they laugh him to ſcorne, and yet this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng to the ſhame they doo him afterwards. For thoſe that talk to hym, whilſt hee is thus babblyng, pots at him wyth their mouthes behind his back, nodde with their heads, holds down their eyes, and ſoothes him in all that hee ſayes, and all this not to prayſe or commend hym: but to bee meery after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at the matter, when they are togethers. And it is a ſport to note, and here one of this great talkers, if any man talk of warre, of the liberall ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of hunting, or of huſbandry, hee will ſtraight leap into the matter, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee bee vtterly ignoraunt in the thing preponed, takyng vppon hym to reaſon of the matter, as if hee were very ſkilfull, or maiſter of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, And to make the herers beleeue that, that is trew hee ſayeth hee bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in an example, ſaying that hee hath ſeene yt, read yt, or hard yt, and all perhaps a ſtark lye, that hee neither ſaw yt, read yt, nor hard yt of any, but onely deuiſed of hys own head, on a ſodeyn, vnder the colour of troth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke a falſe lye. <hi>Acaticus</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> philoſopher, being one day at a feaſt, where hee ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpake, nor offered once to ſpeak: aſked after dinner what was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> occaſion
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:21411:351"/>
of his ſylence, anſwered them thus. It is better for a man to know his tyme whan to ſpeak, then it is to know to ſpeak. For to ſpeak wel, is geuen vs by nature: but to chooſe time to ſpeak, procedeth of wiſedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Epimenides</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> painter, after hee had dwelt long time in <hi>Aſia,</hi> retorned to <hi>Rhodes</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence hee firſt departed, &amp; becauſe none of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Rhodians</hi> euer hard him ſpeak any thing, either of that hee had ſeene, or doon in <hi>Aſia,</hi> they marueiled very much, and prayed him to diſcourſe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome part of that hee had ſeene, and ſuffered in <hi>Aſia.</hi> To whom hee made this aunſwer. Two yeares I ſulked the ſeas, abydyng the perill of the water, and tenne other years I was reſient in <hi>Aſia,</hi> to learn the perfection of a paynters ark: ſyx other yeares I ſtudied in Grece to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome my ſelf to bee ſilent, and now you would I ſhoold feede you with tales and newes. O <hi>Rhodians,</hi> come to mee no more with any ſuch motion: for you ſhould come to my houſe to bye pyctures, and not to here newes. Albeit in ſo many yeares and in ſuch farre and ſtraunge contreis yt could not bee but <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pimenides</hi> had ſeene many things woorthy to bee recounted, and pleaſaunt to here: yet hee woold neuer tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor ſhew them: &amp; ſuer herein hee did like a good philoſopher, and aunſwered like a wiſe and graue perſon. For in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng of ſtraunge things, and of dyuers countreys, there are few that wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them, and many that will ſtand in doubt whether they bee trew or no. And therefore touching this matter alſo, <hi>Pithagoras</hi> the philoſopher was one day aſked vpon what occaſion hee made his ſcholers vſe ſo great ſilence in his colledge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in two yeres after they were entered, they might not ſpeak. He aunſwered thus. In other philoſophers ſchooles they teach their diſciples to ſpeak, but in myne there is taught nothing but to hold their peace. For in the whole world there is no better nor higher philoſophy, then to know to bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del the tongue. It is a maruelous thing to ſee a man, that with tyme his beard and heares of his head become all white, his face wythered, his eares deaf, hys legges ſwollen, his breath ſtynk, his ſpleene ſtopt, and his body faint and feeble with age, and all the parts thereof conſumed, ſaue onely the hart, and tongue, which wee neuer ſee waxe old in maner, how aged or impotent ſo euer hee bee, but rather dayly become green: and that that is woorſt of all is, that what euell the wretched hart thinketh in that crooked and myſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable age, that dooth the accurſed tongue with all celeritie vtter. There ys a company of courtiers in the court, that preſume to bee eloquent, and wel ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, &amp; of courtly enterteignement, which when they will talk of ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant matter, they muſt firſt tell you a lye, and ſurely theſe kynd of courtiers wee may better cal them detracters of others, then cyuil enterteigners. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed bee hee that to the preiudice of his neighbor, maketh profeſſion to bee a courtly interteigner, and you ſhall hardly ſee none of theſe recyted courtiers ieſt of any, but they haue in ſecret ſpunne the threede, to weaue a great cloth of mallice. And yet wee doo theſe men great honor &amp; reuerence, not for any good wil wee beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee are afrayed of their ill tongs. And although to diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble otherwile, it is a graue &amp; wiſe mans part, yet for al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee may not iudge il of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſince wee ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt mans honor &amp; credit co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly to bee no greter nor leſſe, then a maligna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t perſon ſhal ſeeme to vſe his tongue to ſpeak of him. I remember there was in the court in my tyme a noble man, noble of byrth and perſon both, whom I reprooued diuers times (as hys familiar frend)
<pb facs="tcp:21411:352"/>
of his prodigall lyuing, and ill ſpeakyng. And hee made mee thys aunſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Truely ſir, thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> report that I ſpeak ill of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is them ſelues y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doo yt of mee: &amp; if I follow them therein, it is for nothing els, but to bee a witnes for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if any ſeeke to impugne their ſaiyngs: but ſuer of my ſelf I neuer vttered, or deuiſed woord, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> might bee to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preiudice of any. O what ill cauſeth he, that ſpeaketh ill of an other, hee onely offendeth not that beginneth, but hee that aſſiſteth him, &amp; much more hee that heareth him, &amp; after publiſheth it: but abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue all hee that telleth it abrode, &amp; addeth more then hee hard. The fauored of princes muſt alſo think, that though they are prohibited to ſpeak much, yet it is moſt fyt and decent for them to bee true &amp; faithful ſecretaries. For there is no thing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince priſeth more, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecret breſt of his fauored courtier. And therefore I ſay not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out cauſe that they ought to bee ſecret, but moſt ſecret. For the eſteemed courtier muſt haue a better conſideracion of his princes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets committed to him, then of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefits hee receiueth of him. Suer yt ys no ſmall, but a great &amp; moſt neceſſary vertue in a man, to bee cloſe, &amp; of few woords, &amp; ſo ſecret in deede, that hee make no more countenance of that was told him priuily, then if he had neuer hard it ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of. I know an other maner of people ſo prone ro ſpeak ill, that they cannot keepe ſecret their own faults, much leſſe others faults, publiſhing them in euery corner. <hi>Cecilius Metellus</hi> being aſked one day of a Centucion, what hee ment to doo the next day follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng: aunſwered thus. Think not Centurion that thoſe things I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to doo, my ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds ſhal ſo lightly diſcouer: for I am of this mynd, if I knew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my ſhirt had any knowledge of that I will doo to morrow, I woold put it of, &amp; throw it ſtraight in the fyer &amp; ſee it burned before my face. It is not a like truſt, to put money into one mans hands of truſt, &amp; to commit ſecrets to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breſt of an other, &amp; this to bee true wee ſee it plainly, that the prince deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his goods and treaſure to the cuſtody of many, but his ſecrets hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytteth onely to one. The fauored of princes ought to bee ſo ſecret, that what ſo euer they ſee the prince doo or ſay (bee it in the preſence of dyners, and that they are told of it by many) Yet they ought not to bee acknowen of it. For in deede the prince ſpeaketh many things commonly for his pleaſure, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reported agayn of the fauored courtier, wilbee thought true, &amp; moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn. Therefore ſpeakyng generally of this matter I ſay, that ſurely frendes are greatly bound to keepe the ſecrets of their frends: For that day I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my intent to any, the ſelf ſame I make him lord of my liberty. Therefore let that man think hee hath woonne a maruelous treaſure, that hath a ſecret frend. For without doubt it is no ſuch matter of importaunce, to keep trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſaflye locked vp in a cheſt, as it is to commit &amp; truſt ſecrets to the hart of an other. <hi>Plutark</hi> writeth, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> hauing warres with king <hi>Phillip</hi> becauſe there came certayn letters of kyng Phillips to their hands (intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by their ſcouts) directed and ſent vnto his wife <hi>Olimpa:</hi> Which they no ſooner vnderſtoode, but they preſently returned agayn ſafely ſealed, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched of them, as they came firſt vnto them ſaying: that ſyth by their law they were bound to bee ſecret, they would not reueale the ſecrets of others, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they were their mortal enemies, as king Phillip was to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; therefore they woold neither ſee them, nor read the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> openly. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſayeth alſo, that among the Egiptians it was a criminall act for any man,

to bewray the ſecrets of an other, which was prooued trew by thexample of a preeſt, that in the temple of the goddes <hi>Iſis</hi> had deflowered a virgine, &amp; they both truſting to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fydelitie of an other preeſt, making their loue knowen vnto him, euen as they were in <hi>Venus</hi> ſweete delights, hee not regarding any len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger their ſecrets, <hi>in ipſo facto</hi> exclamed &amp; cried out, &amp; therupon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uict &amp; appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iuſtice, theſe poore louers were myſerably executed, &amp; this ſpightful &amp; vnfortunat preeſt condignely baniſhed.

I woold bee very glad to bee in your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, knowi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you to be a fauorer of philoſophy: &amp; if you wil go to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> warres I wil follow you: &amp; if you truſt mee w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> your goods, I wil keepe them careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; faithfully: if you haue children, I wil teach them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al my hart: if you wil vſe my counſel in your affairs, I wil geeue you the beſt I can. And if you will alſo geeue mee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charge of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. I wil gouern it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> my beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. Only one thing I wil requeſt you that you wil neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund mee, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, not to make mee partaker of your ſecrets. For it might happen that what you had told mee in ſecret, your ſelf vnwares at a time might tell it openly, and yet not think of it: and beeing afterwards told you by ſome other, you woold preſently enter into ſuſpect y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it came to knowledge by mee. This phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher woold firſt indent wyth the prince (before hee woold come to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice) that hee ſhoold neuer here any of theſe things, the knowledge whereof bringeth many a man to their end, or at the leaſt to ſome great miſchife: onely to ſhew vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> imminent perill and daunger the ſecretary of a prince ſtandeth in. For our hart is ſuch a frend of newes, that euery hower it feeleth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaund temptations to vtter that to others, that was deliuered to it of ſecret. In this our age wee doo not vſe to keepe ſecrets ſo well, as in old time the Grecians were woont, ſyth wee ſee by experyence, that yf one frend haue to day tolde hys frend a thyng in ſecret, to morrow, yea perhappes the ſelf ſame nyght before, it was told amongſt the neighbors.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:353"/>There are alſo ſome kynd of men ſo deſirous to here news, that to know it, they will ſwere a thouſand othes neuer to reuele in agayn to any. But ſo ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne as they know it, they are like vnto the blood hounds, that follow the deare now here now there ſmelling with their noſes, till they haue found the hurt deare, then they open, and bay for their maiſter. Therefore I cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, &amp; exhort all wiſe &amp; diſcreete men, that they doo not accompany wyth thoſe whom they know are not ſecret. For the hurt that commeth by them, conſiſteth not onely to tell that they know, ſee, and here: but with this they tel that they haue ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined of their own wicked &amp; malicious heads. It cannot bee otherwiſe, but being men, wee are alſo ſubiect to the frailty of a man, as for example. To fal ſometimes into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſinne of the fleſh, &amp; in that to forget the ſinne of gluttony, &amp; to haue ſmall conſideracion of that of ſloth, to bee aſſured in that of auaryce or with that to bee ouercome with paſſion and rage, or to bee puffed vp in the ſynne of pryde. And if perhaps by miſfortune any one chaunce into ſuch mans company, that hath but part, or all theſe condicions, and ſuch one as doo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer and diſcloſe both his own ſecrets and others to, what other can there bee hoped of, then a fyer enflamed in his good fame and reputacion, and a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious plague and peſtilence in his houſe. For that that I haue hard, ſeen, &amp; read, yea and alſo prooued, I ſay and affirme, that there is no bread ſo il ſpent, as that that is geeuen to the ſeruants which open and reuele their mayſters ſecrets: And ſure it may bee ſayd, that ſuch are not ſeruants that ſerue them, but traytors that betray them, and ſell their maiſters liberty. And it is of ſuch importaunce, for the fauored of princes, to keepe ſecret, and not to reuele any part of the princes ſecrets, that euery man muſt think, that when the prynce telleth them any thing in ſecret, hee telleth it not alone vnto them, but rather hee confeſſeth it to them. Princes beeing men (as in deede they are) and much buſyed with the cares of the common wealth, yt cannot bee, but when they are withdrawen a part into their priuy cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, they wil both play, talk, ſleyt, ſygh, laugh, bee angry, threaten, &amp; make, much agayn of ſome before others: All which things though they doo before their ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in ſecret, it is not their pleaſure, neither wil they like, it ſhould bee told abrode amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt their ſubiects. And ſure they haue great reaſon, for men of grauyty &amp; authority, doo not loſe their reputacion for dooing things graue, and of good example: but they are iuſtly noted, when publikely they will ſhew any lightnes or folly, how li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſo euer it bee. Not onely thoſe that bee in aucthority and fauor about the prince but ſuch other officers of the court, &amp; ſeruants of houſhold of the prince alſo, ought not to tell nor reuele any thing they ſee their prince doo. For they may bee wel aſſured, that the prince wilbee more offended and diſpleaſed, to haue that hee dooth in his priuy chamber told abrode, by thoſe of the pryuy chamber, or other whom it pleaſeth him to make familier with him: then hee woold bee, if his treaſorers &amp; receiuers ſhould robbe him of his treaſure. It was told to <hi>Denis</hi> the Siracuſan on a time, that <hi>Plato</hi> the philoſopher was at the chamber doore to ſpeak with him: and hee preſently ſent <hi>Bias</hi> one of hys priuy chamber (that hee loued well) to him, to know what hee would with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng, and <hi>Plato</hi> aſked <hi>Bias</hi> what <hi>Denis</hi> did, &amp; hee au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered that hee lay ſtark naked vppon a table, which when <hi>Denis</hi> vnderſtoode, hee was ſo offended with <hi>Bias,</hi> that hee commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded foorthwith hee ſhould bee beheaded, ſaying

firſt theſe woords vnto him. I wil y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> like a traytor y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bee beheaded, ſith thou haſt traitorouſly betraied mee, <g ref="char:abpre">p̄</g>ſuming to diſcloſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecrets of my cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber. For I ſent thee not to <hi>Plato</hi> to tel him what I did, but to know what hee woold of mee. Now princes familiars &amp; beloued of them, as they muſt bee very circumſpect &amp; heedeful y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they tell no man y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes ſecrets, ſo they muſt bee much carefull y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they tel it not cheefly to women, yea though they were their own wiues. For as women are very good &amp; profitable, to looke to things of houſhold, &amp; ſafly to lock vp their huſbands goods: ſo are they on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide very dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous for a man to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any ſecrets to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

But to end my purpoſe, I will ſpeak thys one woord, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, that I counſell &amp; exhort, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al my hart requeſt princes fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars, or ſeruants, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit not their princes ſecrets to any, how great a fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d or neere kinſman ſo euer hee bee to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

frends &amp; louers of veritie, ſins they did ſo much enrich, and ſublime the ſame, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo many rare and excellent titles. But omitting now theſe philoſophers, who haue truely ſpoken that they knew: let vs come ſpeak of him, that aboue all the world hath exalted veryty, which was the diuine woord, and that was Iheſus Chriſt, the onely begotten ſonne of god, and true glaſſe of eternitie, who being aſked the ſelf ſame thing of <hi>Pylate,</hi> ſayd not to him, I am wiſedome, neither Iuſtice, nor chaſtitie, nor paciens, humilitie, nor charity: But onely ſayd to him, I am verity, to let him vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery creature might bee partaker of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But our lord Iheſus Chriſt, was not partaker of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> verity: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſole &amp; on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, hee being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very truth it ſelf. O, of how many is this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue deſired, &amp; of how few (yea moſt few) obſerued. For in effect it is nothing els, but a mark wherat all good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhoot w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their eyes, &amp; al il &amp; wicked perſons loſe their ſight. The emperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> triumph he made of <hi>Mark Antony,</hi> &amp; his loue <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt others brought to Rome an Egiptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preeſt, of 60. years of age, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenat beeing informed of a ſurety that days of his life hee neuer told lye, they agreed not onely to reſtore him to liberty but to make him hygh preeſt of their temple, and to erect a ſtature of him, among the noble and princely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Rome. <hi>Sparthianus</hi> writeth, that in the tyme of <hi>Claudian</hi> Emperor of Rome, there deceaſed a citizen of Rome called <hi>Pamphilus,</hi> whoſe dooings after his death examined, it was manifeſtly proued, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he neuer ſpake one true woord all his life time, but always lyed in that hee ſayd. Which related vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, hee commaunded hys body ſhould not bee buryed, his goods ſhould bee confiſcate, and hys houſe raſed to the foundacion, and hys wife and children for euer baniſhed Rome and all her territories, to the end there ſhould remayn no memory to the common wealth, of ſo peſtiferous and venemous a beaſt. At that time whan theſe two thyngs thus happened, the Romayns and Egyptians were mortall enemies, and therefore by theſe examples wee may ſee, of what force and power this vertue of veryty is, ſyth the romayns made a ſtature to their enemy, onely for that hee was a trew and iuſt man: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryued of ſepulture their natiue chyld, and a Romayn born, for that hee was a lyar. A trew man may goe in any place where hee lyſteth, freely without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, accompanied with al men not fearing to bee accuſed of any, and may wyth ſaftie reprooue the vicious and ill perſons: and fynally to conclude, hee may wythout the feare of any ſpeak in the face of the world, and ſhew hys face amongſt the beſt. If a man will chooſe a frend, hee neede not bee inquiſityue if hee bee wyſe, iuſt, chaſte, carefull, couragious, or noble, but onely if hee bee trew of hys woord. And if that bee ſo, it followeth that all vertues and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty muſt abound in hym. <hi>Helius Sparthianus</hi> recyteth of the life of <hi>Traian</hi> the Emperor, that beyng one nyght at ſupper, and accompanied with noble men at his boord, they argued of the fydelyty of frends, and infydelity of enemyes, whom <hi>Traian</hi> aunſwered: That hee neuer had frend in his life but hee was good, trew, honeſt, and faythfull: whereupon his lords beſought hym that yt woold pleaſe hym to tell them the occaſion of hys good happe in thys. And hee aunſwered thus. The cauſe why I haue euer been ſo fortunat herein was this, I neuer woold chooſe to my frend a lyar, and couetous man. For in him that raigneth auarice, and lying, there can neuer dwell perfyt frendſhip. Thoſe that are honeſt, &amp; like ſo to bee reputed, muſt endeuor them ſelues to ſpeak well allways, and euer to ſay that that is true: and if they will not doo thys for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:21411:354"/>
conſciens ſake, let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doo it yet to auoid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhame that followeth them. For there can bee no greater mockry or diſpight doon to a man, then openly to make him know hee hath lyed. Wee ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chyld whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee perceiueth hee hath told a lye, hee bluſheth ſtraight, &amp; is aſhamed: much more ought men growen of years, whoſe face is couered w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heares, not onely bluſh, but ſhame to tell a lye. Many tymes I think what a great greef the marchant ſuffereth euery hower not to bee cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a lyar, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee vttereth his ware, &amp; ſuer hee dooth it but becauſe hee woold not loſe his credit. And lo here why they ſweare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to bee more aſſured, where to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary wee ſee many other, that in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunce ſeeme to bee honeſt and graue men, that vſe not that manner: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they wil ſtick no more to tel you a lye, then to loſe a wheat grayn. But here I ſpeak not, neither doo mean to touch thoſe that are in deede vertuous and good men: but I ſpeak of thoſe that thinks them ſelues honeſt, and yet bee not god knoweth. And therefore wee may bee aſſertayned, that a marchaunt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemeth more his goods and marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diſe, then a lier dooth his honor, otherwiſe honeſty. There is nothing that preiudiceth troth ſo much, as a tattling tongue that neuer lyeth: being in maner impoſſible, that amongſt many woords ſome lye bee not enterlaced. All things conſiſteth not in other more, or leſſe, ſaue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the vſe that men haue of yt. For if a man doo vſe to eat lytle, hee always goeth from the table: yf wee vſe to ſleepe litle, wee alſo leaue our bedd: And if wee accuſtome our ſelues alſo to lye, wee ſhall haue it in ſuch a ꝯtinuall vſe, as though wee woold wee ſhall neuer leaue it after. For there are diuers ſorts of men, that as they accuſtome them ſelues to eat &amp; drink oft times in a day, ſo doo they vſe to lye euery hower. But I aſk what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt &amp; moſt parfyt thing in this life, that a man whilſt hee lyueth may enioy. I dare boldly ſay, that it is neither nobilitie, great parentage, nor fauor, neither the great eſtate, helth, nor ryches: but rather that it is the ſole honor, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> tatlers and liars may neuer enioy, becauſe they are neuer credited, nor beleeued in their woords. What fame, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyt, honor, reputacion, or good can hee haue, out of whoſe mouth there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth nothing but lies? A lyer deſerueth credit of no man, neither that any man ſhoold deale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him in any thing, much leſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any matter of truſt into his hands, no nor loue him, nor accept of him, but rather as detracter, &amp; defamer of mens good name, wee ſhould baniſh him our company. <hi>Anniball</hi> that was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> myghty prince of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Carthagians,</hi> ſo valyaunt in warlick prowes, ſo hardy to follow yt, &amp; therewithall ſo fortunat to ouercome his enemies: was yet notwithſtanding blamed of <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> and reputed for a malignant and periured perſon. For hee neuer gaue that hee promyſed to his frends, neither euer kept any couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or agreement made with his enemies. Such was not <hi>Gneus Pompeius</hi> (ſonne to <hi>Pompeie</hi> the great) with whom <hi>Octauian</hi> and <hi>Mark Antony</hi> (both, his mortal enemies) being at ſupper with him on the ſea: <hi>Menodorus</hi> the captayn of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſent him woord, if it were his pleaſure, hee woold ſo lyuely haue hoyſt vp the ſayles of the ſhip, that hee would ſoone haue peryſhed them, or ſunked the ſhyp they were in.

Woords ſuer woorthy of ſo noble a prince, ſonne of ſo great and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:355"/>

For that is a playn demonſtration, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a prepenſed lye hee woold make vs beleeue for a trueth. It is a ſport to ſee a true man, &amp; a lyar in argument together: for the true man enforceth his woords none otherwiſe but thus. Truely frend, it is euen thus as I tell thee, thou mayſt if thou wilt beleue mee. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other to defend &amp; maintayn his lye, hee will inuocate for witnes al the ſaynts in heauen, &amp; as many relicks as are on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, yea &amp; al the deuils of hell: ſo that for defence of the trueth, it ſufficeth to ſtand faſt on his feete: but for defence of a lye, hee muſt runne through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world. If I were a king or prince, to throw the beloued out of fauor, to put my men out of ſeruice, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue men of their office &amp; dignity, or to diſgrade a knight of his order of knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or to geeue no more fayth nor credit to an other: I woold deſire no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion or teſtimony, then once to take hym w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a lye. And I woold thynk it leſſe ill, that the fathers ſhoold rather pardon a great fault in their children, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> frend in his frend, &amp; the maiſter in his ſeruant, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beare w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them in one lye. For by time the wings of ſinne is cut: but to lye is of ſuch condicion, the elder a man waxeth, the more force &amp; power it hath of him. It is not inough for a man to bee free of this vice, but hee muſt alſo fly &amp; ſequeſter him ſelf fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the felowſhip of thoſe, that are poſſeſſed with that foule &amp; inueterate error. For it is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſeene, when a man woold bring out a ſodein lye, to geeue it more credit, hee will auouch his frend for a witnes, ſaiyng hee knoweth yt, &amp; was preſent with mee. Now thoſe that heareth this famous lye, &amp; knoweth the very troth in deede of the matter as it was, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth his frend hee auoucheth (although hee bee in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nocent in the matter) for that hee is brought in for teſtimony, as they doo this notorius and ſhameles lyar. I ſhould ly alſo for compagny, if I ſhould deny to tell you, that, being in the court vpon a tyme in a good preſence, a frend of myne ſtuck not to forge a lye amongſt others, and ſayd that hee had ſayled in a ſhyp made all of the canes of Synamon, and hee auouched mee for a wytneſſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrmyng that I was likewiſe wyth him in hys company in the ſhyp: and I to ſaue hys honor (hee beeyng my very frend) beeyng aſhamed hee ſhould incurre the name of a lyer, was compelled ſeriouſly to confyrm hys tale wyth hym, whereof I repented mee after wyth all my hart. For thereby I was in ſecret noted of the hearers, to bee as great a lyar as hee. Alſo an other time when I we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to preach at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> court, being diſeaſed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gout, I walked vp &amp; down w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ſtaff of a reede to ſtay mee w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al, the ſelf ſame ꝑſon I told you of before, told amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prelates y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were in the chappel where I preached, that hee had geeuen mee
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21411:355"/>
a reede or cane to walk withall, that from one knobb to an other, it woold hold three great pottes of wyne. Lo now by my exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple you may gather what ſhame and diſhoneſty an honeſt and vertuous man ſuſtaineth, to bee a frend and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyon of ſo ſhameleſſe and horrible a lyer. For to bee playn, I was brought to this paſſe, by means of this frend of myne, that I coold not tell what I ſhoold doo, but when I hard him begin to ſpeak, to fly from him, and leaue him, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I woold not bee reputed a lyke of reputacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him. Howbeit in thend I was forced to vſe this pollycy: that what hee had openly auouched mee a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in, ſecretly agayn I woold excuſe my ſelf, and deny yt. But now retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to our matter agayn, I ſay: That theſe courtiers, and familiers of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ought to exyle and baniſh from them this abhominable cryme of lyeng.</p>
                     <p>For if a mean gentleman or ſimple plebeyan happen ſome tymes to tell one thing for an other, it is but taken of the hearers ſtreight for a ſimple ly. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng ſpoken by one of the fauored of the court, or other gentleman of reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is thought a kynd of treaſon. For lyke as betwixt god, and the ſinner, our ſauior Iheſus Chriſt is our only meane and mediatour, being called vpon by the prieſt, euen ſo betwixt the king and his ſubiects, that are ſuters to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie: thoſe that are in fauour with the prince, are mediatours for them. Now therfore, if theſe prieſts be double in their words, and diſſemblers in that they ſpeak, how ſhall the ſinnes of the one bee pardoned, and the buſines of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpatched. O wofull and vnhappy ſinner, that putteth his ſinnes into the hands of a naughty and wicked priſt, and lyke wiſe vnfortunat and miſerable is the poore ſuter, that committeth his affaiers to the truſt and diſpatch of a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſſembling officer. There are many officers in Princes courts, that telleth the poore ſuters ſtill they will diſpatch them, but when it commeth to the puſh to folow the matter, al his fair woords are then but wynd, and in dede they make an art of it, to ſpeak all men fayer, to promis much, and to performe nothing, weaning with their ſwete flattering woords to winne the harts and good willes of all, little regarding the great expence and loſſe of tyme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poor ſuter, much leſſe alſo reſpecting their own honor, honeſties, and credyt. Sure it were leſſe diſhonor for them, to bee counted rough and churliſh, then to bee bruted for lyers, and breakers of their promys. The officer of the princes pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, that is a diſſembler, and lyer in his woords &amp; dooings, hee may for a time maintain his ſuits, and goe through with his matters: but in the end, his tret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries perceiued, him ſelf, his fautor, and all his dealing lye in the duſt, and are vtterly ouerthrowen. O how many haue I ſeene ryſe in court of nothing, to great matters and offyces, and this not through their painfull ſeruice, but altogeethers by means of their deceipt &amp; flattery they cunningly vſed: not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted alſo for their merits, but only by a ſubtil meane &amp; policy they had to draw water to their myll: not for any good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience they had, but only for their gret dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vſed in their practiſes. And al this not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preiudice of others, but rather to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gret hurt &amp; vtter vndooing of their neighbor: &amp; not for any bounty they had to geue liberally, but a gredy &amp; couetous deſire to get: not for any need<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful buſines, but to haue thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are ſuꝑfluous: &amp; not for to reliue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore &amp; needy, but only to ſatiſfy their inſatiable apetits: &amp; infyne, their accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t caſt, wee haue ſeen after their deth their goods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fiſcated, their ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts dyſꝑſed, &amp; gone away, &amp; their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for euer vndoon. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in brief ther was no more memory of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this world, &amp; god grant alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other lyfe their ſoules were not damned.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:356"/>
Courtiers may eaſely with their fauor and credit attaine to great poſſeſſions, as the Iudges may alſo in robbing, the counſellers in pleading, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining naughty cauſes, the captains in powling the prince of the ſoldiers wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the marchants in their falſe weights &amp; meaſures, &amp; their brokers, in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling lyes out of all meaſure. But in thend of their iorney, &amp; pilgrimage, they may bee aſſured that the ſoules of the fathers ſhal not only bee damned in hel, but the goods alſo ſhalbee taken from their children. And that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is truely and iuſtly gotten by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honeſt induſtry &amp; trauel of the man, with a good zeal &amp; holy intent, &amp; to a good &amp; iuſt end: it is written that it ſhalbee of long continuaunce, &amp; by the permiſſion of god, &amp; praier of the people, it ſhall alſo proſper, &amp; increaſe. For the true gotten goods, achiued by ſwet &amp; labor of man, god dooth always proſper &amp; augment and therefore continuing our matter I ſay, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes officers ought to determine with them ſelues, to bee vpright in all their acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; dooings, &amp; aboue all, true &amp; iuſt of their woords: w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> dooing they ſhalbee ſure to bee beloued of all, not alone of them that paſſe vnder their lee, but alſo of thoſe whom they haue denyed fauor. And alſo they neede not to bee afraid to ſpeak boldly in all places where they come, beſides that they ſhalbe reuerenced of all men. Where to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary, if hee bee a lyar, a babler, and diſſembler, there are few that wil fear them, much leſſe loue them, &amp; leaſt of all do them reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or honor. And although wee cannot deny, but that theſe officers of the court, &amp; other men of auctority bee wayted vpon, viſited, accompanied, reuerenced, and honored of much ſort of men: yet it were a folly for vs to beleeue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their trayn &amp; attendants doo them all that honor &amp; reuerence, for any deſire they haue to doo them any ſeruice: but only they vſe all that curteſy, &amp; capping, to get them ſelues &amp; their ſutes quickly diſpatched. And this to bee true, wee ſee it dayly in experience. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe ſuters haue atchiued their ſuit &amp; deſire, they doo not only leaue to accompany him, &amp; attend vppon him, but more ouer they gett the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> home, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out either thanking of them, or once taking their leaue of him. If all thoſe that haue function or office of eſtate or dignity, (hauing charge of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of great &amp; weighty matters, beeing alſo lyers &amp; diſſemblers in their doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) knew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yll reports that goe of them, &amp; how they conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pne their corrupt &amp; naughty co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces: mee thinketh it impoſſible (if they bee not altogether grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les) but they muſt needs either change co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition &amp; eſtate, or els quyte geeue vp their roomes &amp; offices. For they are in euery mans mouth called bablers, liers, diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blers, traitors, periurers, miſerable, auaricious, &amp; vicious. And yet a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer thing then all this, &amp; that is: whyleſt they lyue, a thouſand co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playns of him: and after they are dead &amp; buried, they take vp their bones out of the graue to hang the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp vpon a gybbet. For thus ſaith the prouerb. <hi>Such lyfe, ſuch end.</hi> So that wee may ſay, that to theſe officers aboue recyted, reſteth nothing but only theſe goodly rytles. And heereunto wee may add alſo, that officers of lyke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to them, neede not to haue any to accuſe them, neither yet to puniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For a time will come one day, that they will plunge themſelues ſo deepe into a ſea of troubles, that it cannot bee choſen, but they muſt needes at laſt drown, &amp; vtterly periſh, or at the leaſt to bee driuen into the hauen of their greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſo that they ſhal cary the burden of their own wickednes, &amp; be condingly chaſtiſed with their own folly.

                           </gap>hia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> writeth that there was ſometyme a ſenator in Rome called <hi>Lucius Torqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who was a tyrant, a diſſembler, a great lyer, and very ſeditious, deuyſyng only to ſett diſcord between the emperor <hi>Tytus,</hi> and the people: who being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tymes complained vpon by the people vnto <hi>Tytus,</hi> hee anſwered them thus. I pray you good people, let no man ſeeke to reproue him, perſwade him, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, nor puniſh him: for hee is ſo wicked, and peruerſe in al things, that I truſt in the gods one day his own crooked &amp; naughty condition, ſhall make reuenge and ſatiſfaccion of all the miſchiefs hee hath doon mee: w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> was a wonderfull thing in this prince, that for an iniury of ſuch importance as that was, he woold haue no other reuenge of him, but referre al to that hee hoped to ſee by his own yll nature. And ſure the matter wel conſidered, hee had good reaſon to doo yt. For a wicked perſon is of this condition, that after hee hath once begon to doo euill, hee neuer ceaſeth dayly to doo woorſe (if hee bee not reclaimed by ſome honeſt man) vntill ſuch time as vnwares (not looking to him ſelf) hee vtterly falleth to ruyn &amp; perdition. So that wee may aptly compare an yll man, to a ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dell, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> after it is once lyght, it neuer leaueth burning, till it haue made an end of it ſelf. In great &amp; weighty matters ſometimes, ſuch as haue the diſpatchyng of them, are wont to ſpeak one woord for an other, &amp; alſo to make ſome faynt promiſſes to their ſuters, not in reſpect to lye to them nor deceiue them: but to prolong them lenger in ſuit, to encreaſe their gaigne the more. Which I muſt ſay they ought not to doo, much leſſe once to think it. When the fauored courtier or officer of the prince is moued in any matter by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſuter, let him conſider well if it bee any thing that may diſpleaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, bee it neuer ſo little: for they muſt take great heede that they tell not princes, nor their ſeruants, any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they know may bee diſpleaſant to their yeres: but only that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhalbee both pleaſaunt to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eare, profitable to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purſe, &amp; there withall, that it bee true &amp; neceſſary to bee told &amp; looked to. For there is no greter deſtruccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weal, then to bring falſe reports vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of his affairs. It is one of the greteſt kinds of treaſon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can bee, for a prince to diſcloſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecrets of his hart to his fauored courtier, and for him again to tell y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince nothing but lyes, &amp; tales. How great a frend ſo euer the prince be to his fauored courtier, the beloued courtier ought not to pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſume to aduaunce him ſelf to tell, or make his prince beleeue one thing for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the matter afterwards diſcouered, &amp; the troth knowen, it ſhall not bee enough for him in his excuſe to tel the prince y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee made him beleeue ſo, only to ſatiſfy his frend. For the king may iuſtly tell him, that it is but an excuſe, &amp; that hee ment no other but to deceiue him. For princes ears &amp; condicions, are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate: that I am bold to admoniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are his familyers, &amp; beloued of him, that they indeuour them ſelues alwaies to ſpeak (with all humble duity &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence) that that is true, yea though in ſecrete it pleaſeth the prince to bee mery w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> them. This is euer true: hee that is a frend of verity, is alſo of iuſtice: and hee that is a frend of iuſtice, is alſo of the common weal: and hee that is a frend of the common weal, is euer indued wyth a good conſcience: and hee that hath a good conſcience, conſequently is of a good lyfe, hee that is of a good lyfe, is alſo of a good ſame, and beloued of all. Albeeit wee cannot deny, but that his enemyes will euer ſpeak yll of him: yet wee may ſay alſo, that they can neuer hurt nor condemne him: but rather hee ſhoold bee counted a foole of all men, that will goe about or ſeeke to bee his enemy, who is honeſt in his doi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:357"/>
trew in his woords, modeſt in his behauiour, beloued, and wel thought of of al. Therefore hee putteth him ſelf into a great peril, that dare make him ſelf a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, &amp; fellow in dooings, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a wiſe &amp; vertuous man. For hee muſt think, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panying with ſuch a man, hee acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyeth not his perſon alone, but alſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertues that raigne in him: &amp; if hee doo repugne &amp; gainſay reaſonable things, hee ſhall ſtraight ſhew him ſelf to come of a wicked race, &amp; to bee plunged and rooted in all malyce. Now to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end wee may leaue nothing beehind, that may ſerue to aduyſe &amp; counſell this our fauored courtier, I ſay alſo: that there are many other in fauor with the prince, that oft tymes doo procure the prince to geeue offices of dignity, &amp; realty of the realme, ſometimes to their kinſfolks, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhiles to their frends, &amp; afterwards to their ſeruants alſo: w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> perhaps are ſo vnmeet &amp; vnworthy for them, that neither their merits ſhall deſerue to haue them, nor their knowledge &amp; experience alſo fitt, for ſo weighty an adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And they doo not procure theſe offices for them, for that they are wiſe, and capable: but only to aduance them aboue others, &amp; becauſe they are very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome &amp; importunat. I am ſory to write it, &amp; much more to ſee it, that offices are not geeuen now for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefit of the comon wealth, but to recompence thoſe of whom the fauored courtier hath receiued pleaſure, or els to ſatiſfy the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunacy of his ſeruants of his own houſe. But by proces of tyme it might happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (by means of their ſkilleſſe rule) that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king woold take from them altogether their offices, or remoue them from one place to an other, although they were neuer well ſettled in a town, &amp; commodiouſly. And being the princes pleaſure to doo thus, the wiſe &amp; beloued courtier muſt take heede hee doo not contrary y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king, much leſſe take vppon him to defend the yll gouernment of thoſe officers, hoping thereby to come to greater honor. For it were leſſe hurt for him, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer loſt his eſtate &amp; office, then hee his credit &amp; reputation. Therefore thoſe in fauor &amp; auctority ought to content them ſelues w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prince, the ſeruants with their maiſters, &amp; the parents &amp; kinſfolks with the princes officers, for that they procured them theſe offices at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kings hands, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the yll willes of many: w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out that they further preaſe, &amp; importune the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſuborn their faults. For after that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dooings of theſe woorthy officers bee once diſcouered to bee naught &amp; corup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is impoſſible by any means to make them good before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whom all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> means the parents &amp; kinſfolks of ſuch perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s can make, cannot ſtead the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bring them to their firſt honor, by their own folly loſt. And now to end thys our preſent volume of the fauored courtier, I doo aſſure al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beloued courtiers, that if god ſhall fynd purity in their ſoules, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comon weal iuſtice in their houſe, &amp; the king troth in their mouthes, &amp; fidelity in their harts, the good and honeſt men grace in their fauor, &amp; that the yll &amp; wicked boaſt them ſelues no more of their autority &amp; office, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore ſhall praiſe them for their good woorks, &amp; the king alſo fynd them faithfull ſeruants, I will at this preſent w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> myne own hand geeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch faith &amp; aſſurance, that they ſhall neede neuer to feare that god wil forſake them, nor that men can hurt them, and that they ſhal neuer bee detected of any infamy, ouerthrowen by any miſfortune, neither put out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor &amp; credit with their prince at any tyme.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yeare of the foundation of Rome .720. and .xlii. of the age of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and twoo yeares before he tooke poſſeſſion of the Empire, the twenty daie of Auguſt, about the going downe of the Sunne, in the Realme of <hi>Sicill</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Palermo</hi> (a porte of the Sea) there chaunced a thing perillous to them that ſawe it then, and no leſſe dread full to thoſe whiche ſhall heare it nowe. Whiles they of <hi>Palermo</hi> were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating a great feaſte with much ioy, that they had vanquiſhed the nauy of the <hi>Numidians,</hi> the pirates deuiding their bootie, were preuented by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the citie, who commaunded the whole ſpoyle to be layde vp tyll the warres were finiſhed: for ſuch was the lawe of the Ile. And truly it was a iuſt lawe, for oftentimes the only let why the peace is not made, betwene princes, is becauſe there wanteth riches to ſatiſfie the domages done in warres. When all the people were retourned home vnto their houſes to ſupper (for it was in the Sommer) there appeared an hughe monſter in the citie in this fourme. He ſeamed to be of the length of three cubites, his heade was balde, ſo that his ſcull did appeare. He hadde no eares, ſaue onely twoo holes in his necke, whereby men iudged that he hearde: he had two wrythen hornes like a goate, his right arme was longer then his left, his handes wer lyke the feete of horſes, without throte, his ſhoulders and his head were both of one height, his ſhoulders ſhone as doth the ſcales of fiſhes, his breſt was all rough of heere, his face in all thinges was lyke vnto a man, ſaue that it had but one eye which was in the middeſt of his forehead. In his noſe there was but one noſethril. From the middle downwarde there was nothinge ſeene, becauſe it was all couered, he ſatte on a chariot with foure wheles, whiche was drawen with foure beaſtes, that is, two Lions before, and two Beares behinde. No man could tell of what wood the chariot was made. In faſhion it differed nothing from thoſe whiche other men doe accuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly vſe. Within the chariot ſtode a great chauldron with eares, wherein the monſtre was, wherfore it could not be ſeene but from the midle vpwarde. It wandered a great ſpace in the citie from one gate to an other, caſtinge out ſparkes of fyre. The feare was ſo great throughout all the citie, that ſome women with childe were with great daunger deliuered, and others beyng faynte harted fell downe dead. And all the people both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men great and ſmall ran to the temples of <hi>Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Februa,</hi> with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefull clamoures and cries makyng their importunate prayers. At the ſame tyme, all theſe rouers were lodged in the gouernours pallace of the citie, whoſe name was <hi>Solyno,</hi> borne at <hi>Capua,</hi> wher alſo the ryches was kepte. After the monſtre hadde bene in all partes of the citie (or in the moſte parte
<pb facs="tcp:21411:358"/>
therof) it came to the pallace where the pirates were, and cut one of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons eares of, and with the bloude thereof wrote theſe letters vpon the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace gate which was ſhut <hi>R. A. S. P. I. P.</hi> Theſe letters were of diuers men diuerſly interpreted ſo that the interpretations were mo then the letters. And in the ende, a woman propheteſſe greatly eſteamed for her ſcience, (to whom God had geuen this ſecret knowledge) opened the true meanynge of theſe letters, ſaying <hi>R.</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Reddite, A. aliena, S. ſi vultis. P. propria, I. in pace, P. poſſidere.</hi> Whiche altogethers is to ſay. Render vnto other that which is theirs, if you in quiet wyll poſſeſſe your owne. Truely the pirates were wonderfully afrayd of this ſodaine commaundement, and the woman was highly commended for her expoſition. This being done, the monſtre went the ſame nyght out of the Citie vnto a high hill called <hi>Iamicia,</hi> and there ſtode for the ſpace of three dayes in the ſight of the citie, the Lyons with terrible voyces roaring, the Beares with no leſſe fearefull cryes ragyng, and finally the monſtre moſte dreadfull flames caſting. During al this tyme there was neither byrde ſene in the ayre, nor beaſte in the fieldes. And the people offred ſuche great ſacrifices vnto their Gods, that they brake the vaynes of their handes and feete, and offred the bloude thereof to ſee if they could appeaſe their wrathes. Theſe three dayes being paſſed, there appeared in the element a marueilous darke cloude, whiche ſeamed to darken the whole earth, and there with it began to thunder and lighten ſo terriblye, that ſundrye hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fell to the grounde, and infinite men ended their lyues. And laſte of all ther came ſuch a flame of fire from the monſtre, that it brent both the pallace where the rouers were, &amp; all other thinges that were therin, ſo that all was conſumed with fire: yea the very ſtones theim ſelues. The tempeſt was ſo great, that there fell aboue two thouſand houſes, and there died more then ten thouſand perſones. In this place where this monſtre was on the toppe of the hill, the emperour edified a ſumptuous temple to the god <hi>Iupiter</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall memory of the ſame. Whereof afterward <hi>Alexander</hi> emperoure, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing warre with the people of that Iſle made a ſtrong caſtle.</p>

                     <p>AT the ſame time when this woful chaunce happened in the Iſle, there dwelled a Romaine in the ſame citie called <hi>Antigonus,</hi> a man of a noble bloud, and wel ſtroken in age, who with his wife and doughter were baniſhed two yeares before from Rome. The cauſe of his baniſhment was this. There was an olde laudable cuſtome in Rome inſtituted, by <hi>Quintus Cincinatus</hi> the dictatour, that two of the moſt auncient ſenatours ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo euery man ſhould receiue condigne puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to his offence. But thei neuer puniſhed before they warned, for they vſed the one yeare to admoniſhe them of their faultes, and the next yeare if they dyd not amende to punyſhe theim, or elles to banyſhe theim. Theſe were the wordes of the lawe in the fift table, and thyrde chapter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:358"/>The ſacret ſenate doth ordeyne, the happy people do conſent, &amp; the auncient colonies doe allowe, that if men as men in one yeare doe treſpaſſe, that men as men for that yeare doe wynke at them: but if they as euill men doe not amende, that then the good as good doe puniſhe them. Moreouer the lawe ſayde, the firſt faultes are diſſembled withall, becauſe they are committed through weake ignoraunce: but the ſecond ſhal be puniſhed, becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceade of negligence and malice. This inquiry was made in the moneth of December, becauſe in the moneth of Ianuary folowynge the officers of Rome were elected. And it was reaſon the good from the euill ſhould be knowen, to thentent they might knowe who merited to haue them, &amp; who deſerued to go without them. The chiefe cauſe why this <hi>Antigonus,</hi> his wife, and his doughter were baniſhed was this. It was ordeined by the eleuenth emperour of Rome <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> that no man ſhould be ſo hardy as to piſſe nere the dores of any temple. And <hi>Caligula</hi> the fourth emperour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, that no woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould geue, or ſel any letters of witchecrafts to hange about the peoples neckes, to deliuer them from the feuer quartaine. And <hi>Cato</hi> the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour made a lawe, that neither young ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor mayde ſhould talke togethers at the conduictes where they vſed to fetche water, nor at the ryuer where they waſhed their clothes, nor at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bakehouſe where they baked their bread: becauſe al the wanton youth of Rome ordinarely haunted one of theſe two places. It chaunced when the cenſours and conſulles viſited the warde of mounte <hi>Celio, Antigonus,</hi> who dwelled thereby, was accuſed to haue piſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the walles of the temple of <hi>Mars:</hi> and his wife likewyſe was complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of for ſelling wrytinges to cure the feuers: and his doughter was noted for one that commonly haunted the conduictes, riuers, and bakehouſes to talke with younge men, the whiche in thoſe daies was a great ſhame to maydes of Rome. The cenſours therefore ſeinge the euill preſident whiche they founde in the houſe of <hi>Antigonus</hi> at that tyme, regiſtred alſo before, and that he had bene gently thereof admoniſhed: baniſhed him into the Iſle of <hi>Scicilly,</hi> for as long time as it ſhould pleaſe the ſenate. And lyke as in ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and goodly buyldinges one ſtone falleth not without ſhakyng of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo it chaunceth likewyſe to men. For commonly one miſchaunce com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not alone but that another immediatly foloweth. I ſpeake it for this purpoſe, for that <hi>Antigonus</hi> was not onely depriued of his honoure, goodes, and countrey, but alſo by an earth quake, his houſe fel down to the ground, &amp; ſlewe his deareſt beloued doughter. Whyles both theſe great miſchaunces happened, I meane of the monſtre of <hi>Scicily,</hi> and of the baniſhement of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus</hi> from Rome: Marke the emperour was in the warres againſte the <hi>Argonautes</hi> where he receiued a letter from <hi>Antigonus</hi> of his baniſhemente, whereof the emperoure was marueylous ſory: as it appeareth by the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere whiche he ſent to comforte him.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21411:359"/>
as the Romaines had prepared all thinges conuenient for ſuche a glorious triumphe: There was one thing done whiche neuer was ſene in Rome, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſame day of his triumphe his ſonne <hi>Comodus</hi> by the aſſent of the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Rome, was choſen emperour after the death of his father. He was not choſen at the requeſt of his father, for he was againſt it: ſaiyng that the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ought not to be geuen for the merites of thoſe whiche are dead, but he ſhould be choſen for his own good workes being aliue. This emperour ſaid oftentimes that then Rome ſhould be vndone, when the election ſhalbe take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the ſenate, &amp; when the emperour ſhal enherite the empire by patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Now to come to our matter: themperour being at <hi>Salon</hi> trauayled much to bring his men into Rome in good order: and Rome was more careful for to receiue him triumphantly, as it appertained to ſuch a great conqueſte. He was marueilouſly wel beloued of al the empire, and he alwayes ſtudied the wealthe of his people, and they were alwayes moſt faithful in his ſeruices. So that ſundry times there was a queſtion moued in the ſenate, whiche of theſe two thinges was better beloued, Either the emperour of his people, or the people of their emperour. So that one day they appointed two iudges in this caſe, the one was the Embaſſadour of the <hi>Parthes,</hi> and the other was the Embaſſadour of the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and the information was geuen on bothe partes in writing. The emperour alleaged the great profite that he had done to the common wealth, and the many euils which he had deliuered it from. On the other part the ſenatours declared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good dedes they had done in his abſence, and the great loue they bare him alwayes in his preſence. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe the emperour an other day moued an other queſtion to the ſenate, affir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming that it was more glory for him to haue ſuch ſubiectes, then for them to haue ſuch an emperour. The ſenate denied it, affirming that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort was greater that they had of him: then that which he could haue of them. And in this wiſe the emperour gaue the glory to his people, and the people gaue the glory to their emperour. Thus merily this matter was reaſoned of againe. It was a pleaſaunt thing to heare the reaſons wherwith eche parte proued his purpoſe. For the good emperour attributed the whole laude for a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual memory vnto the people, becauſe of the great obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, diligent ſeruice, and faithful loue which he had found in them. And on the other part the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunat people gaue the glory vnto the emperour, for his clemency, &amp; merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, for his vprightuous gouerninge, for his honeſtie of liuing, &amp; for his ſtout courage in conquering. It was a thing worthy of noting, to ſe how the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple gaue the honour to their emperour, and howe the emperour attributed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prayſe to his people. Theſe matters were deliuered in truſte to the ſtraunge Embaſſadours, to thend that all people might learne to obey their princes, and alſo princes learne to loue their people: to thende that by ſuch examples (as it was reaſon) the good ſhould be encouraged, and the euil diſcomforted. Thus the emperour prepared al thinges ready with his capitaines and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues for his entring, and the people of Rome made as great preparation for to receiue him. It was a meruailous thing to ſee what people came forth of Rome to mete him, &amp; what an infinite numbre were at <hi>Salon</hi> to behold him. They that were at <hi>Salon</hi> had their eies there, and their hartes at Rome: and they that were at Rome, had their hartes at <hi>Salon,</hi> in ſuche ſorte that their
<pb facs="tcp:21411:359"/>
eies daſeled with that they ſawe, and their hartes alſo reioyced for that they hoped to ſee. For there is no greater tormente to the harte, then when it is deferred from that which it greatly deſireth.</p>

                     <p>YOu ſhal vnderſtande, that the Romaines vſed alwayes, in the moneth of Ianuary, to permit that their emperoures ſhould triumphe. And it chaunced that at that time when they prepared for the triumphe, <hi>Fauſtine</hi> the empreſſe cauſed diuers noble barons to demaunde licence of the emperoure, that her doughter might come from her miſtres where ſhe was taught, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feaſtes. Her name was <hi>Lucilla:</hi> who was elder then the prince <hi>Comodus</hi> her brother. She had a goodly geſture, ſhe was well made in the body, &amp; derely beloued of her mother, whom ſhe reſembled not only in beauty, but alſo in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Though the requeſt ſemed to be reaſonable, and thoſe that made it his counſellers &amp; great about him, &amp; though him whom they aſked was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhe that demaunded it was the mother, and ſhe for whom this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt was made was the doughter: yet the emperour would not graunt it, but halfe againſt his wil. <hi>Fauſtine</hi> when ſhe had obteined licence was excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding glad, and ſo ſone as ſhe might poſſible, ſhe brought her doughter home vnto the pallace. And when the daye of the great feaſt &amp; ſolempne triumphe came: the young damoiſel perceiuing her ſelfe at large without any gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, truſting in the innocencie of her ſelfe, eſtemed not the malice of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man: but reioyced with thoſe that reioyced, talked with them that tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, behelde them that behelde her, and ſhe thought becauſe ſhe mente euyll to no man, that no man wylled euyll to her. In thoſe dayes it was as great an offence for a mayde of Rome, to laughe in the company of men: as it was for a woman of Grecia to be taken in adultery with a prieſt. So greatly was the honeſtie at that tyme of the Romaine Matrones regarded, and the lyghtnes of the maydens was ſo deteſted, that they gaue more ſharper puniſhement for one offence done openly, then for twoo other whiche were committed in ſecreat. Amonge all other thinges, from theſe ſeuen the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Matrones did marueilouſly refrayne, that is to wete: from talkyng muche at feaſtes, from gready eating amonge ſtraungers: From drynkyng wyne whyles they were whole: From talkyng in ſecreate with any man: From lyfting vp their eyes in the temples: From gaſyng muche out at the wyndowes. And from wandryng abroade without their huſbandes. For the woman that was apprehended in any of theſe thynges, was alwayes after counted as one defamed. There are many thynges ſuffred in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones of meane eſtate, whiche can not be endured in thoſe of hygher degree: For Ladies of highe renowme, can not kepe the reputation of their eſtates, vnleſſe they are marueilous circumſpecte in all their doynges. All thynges that degenerate from their kynde deſerue blame: but the diſhoneſt woman meriteth infamy. If ladies wylbe counted ladies in dede, let them knowe howe muche they excell others in ryches, ſo muche leſſe lycence haue they then other to goe gaddinge in the ſtreates. For of a ſuretie the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of their ryches, and the lybertie of their perſonnes, ſhould not be a
<pb facs="tcp:21411:360"/>
ſpurre to prouoke them to gadde abroade, but rather a brydle to keape them within. All this is ſpoken for this cauſe that <hi>Lucilla,</hi> as a mayde tender and younge, and <hi>Fauſtine</hi> her mother, as one not very olde: ſometymes on foote, and ſometymes ryding: ſometymes openly, and nowe and then ſecreatly: Sometymes with company, and at other tymes alone: Sometymes by day, and ofttymes by night: vſed to foote the ſtreates of Rome, to view the fieldes of <hi>Vulcane:</hi> To ſport them by the ryuer of <hi>Tiber:</hi> to gather the fruites in the Ortechardes of <hi>Saturne:</hi> to ſuppe at the conduites of <hi>Nero,</hi> and ſuche other vagaries they vſed. The whiche thinges though their age did deſyre, and their idlenes allure them vnto: yet the grauitie of ſuche ladies ought to haue withdrawen them from it. I wyll ſpeake one thing, to thende that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ladies and gentlewomen may take warning thereby: whiche is, that I can not tell whiche was greater, either the ſmall diſcretion whiche moued <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> and <hi>Lucilla,</hi> to wander in ſuche ſorte aboute the ſtreates: or the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacitie that euyll men tooke thereby to talke of their perſonnes, and doubte of their honeſties. The keaping of women in their houſes, is lyke vnto a brydle to holde ſtyll euyll mens tongues. The woman that is a ſtrayer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, putteth her good name in muche daunger. Of trouth it were better for a woman neuer to be borne: then to lyue with an euyll name. Amonge all the families of the auncient Romaines, that of the <hi>Cornelians</hi> was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted moſte fortunate, for among the men there was neuer anye founde a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, nor among the women any that was defamed. The hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſaye, that there was one woman of that lynage, onely for beyng light in her behauiour, was by the handes of her owne parentes executed and put to death. Surely it was well done of the Romaines, to thintent that the lightnes of one woman alone, ſhould not defame the whole family. Where as is noblenes, and honeſtie: there the matters that touche the honor, ought not to tary whyles they be remedied by iuſtice: but from that man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which among al hath loſt his good name, from the nombre of the liuing he alſo ought to be taken. It is not ſufficient for one to him ſelfe to be good: but it is requiſite that he geue no occaſion to others to iudge him to be euil. Al the loſſes of temporal goodes that chaunce vnto men in this life, oughte not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with a litle blemiſhe of a mans good name. The man that haſardeth for a trifle his good name in this world, ſhall at a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth ſhootes ſcarſly ſhoote one right. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwyſe, the man that hath loſt his honeſty, and that eſtemeth not the reputation of his perſone: truly from him we ſhall neuer ſee any good thing proceade. Now the emperour like vnto a wiſe ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter, fearing after the great calmes ſome tempeſtuous ſtorme: ſeing the lightnes of his doughter and vanitie of the mother (I meane in the time of this great mirth and gladnes) feared leſt any infamy ſhould enſewe vnto theſe two ladies. And for a ſurety he doubted not without a cauſe for it is an infallible rule of enuious fortune, to geue vs in many yeres a litle proſperitie, to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that afterward ſodainly ſhe may bring vs into ſome great aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.

                     <p>WHen the tryumphes before named were finyſhed, this good Emperour being willyng to vnbourden his hart and to aduyſe <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> &amp; to teache the youg damoſel his doughter, and to the end that no man ſhold heare it, he called them a part, and ſayd vnto them theſe words. I am not contente <hi>Fauſtine</hi> with that thy doughter did, nor yet with that which thou haſt done being her mother. The doughters if they wilbe counted good children, muſt learne to obeye their fathers: and the mothers if they wil be counted good mothers, muſt learne to bring vp their doughters wel. When the mother is honeſt, and the doughter ſhamefaſt, the father is excuſed in geuyng councel. It is great ſhame to the father being a man, that the mother being a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould chaſtiſe his ſonne. And it is a great reproch to the mother, that the doughter ſhould be chaſtiſed by the hands of any man. There was a law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted among the <hi>Rhodiens,</hi> that neyther the father ſhould haue to doe wyth the doughters, nor the mothers with the ſonnes, but the men vſed to bring vp the men, and the women the women. And in ſuch wiſe, that they aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding al in one houſe, it ſemeth vnto the fathers that they had no doughters, and vnto the mothers that they had no ſonnes. O Rome, Rome, I bewaile the not for to ſe the ſtreates vnpauid, nor to ſe the houſes ſo decayed, nor to ſe the battlements ſo fallen downe, nor the timber hewed downe, nor for the dyminiſhing of the habytaunts, for al this tyme bringeth, and tyme taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, but I wepe for the, and wepe for the againe, to ſe the vnpeopled of good fathers, and vnprouided in the nouriſhing of their children. Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to decay, when the diſciplyne of ſonnes and doughters was enlarged, &amp; that their brydle was let at lybertye. For ther is now ſuch boldnes in boyes, and ſo lytle ſhamefaſtnes in girles, with diſhoneſty of the mothers, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> where as one father ſuffiſed for .xx. ſonnes, and one mother for xx. doughters: now xx. fathers dare ſcarcely vndertake to bring vp wel one ſonne, &amp; xxx, mothers one doughter. I ſay this to you <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> you remember not how you are a mother, for you geue more libertie to your dougher then ought to be ſuffred. And now <hi>Lucilla</hi> remember not how you are a doughter: for you ſhowe to haue more liberty then requireth for a yong mayden. The greateſt gift that the gods haue geuen to the Matrons of Rome is: becauſe that they are wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men, they kepe them ſelues cloſe and ſecret, and becauſe they are Romaines, they are ſhamefaſt.

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:361"/>The common wealth requyreth it of great neceſſity, that the women which therin enhabyte ſhould be as honeſt, as the captaines valyaunt: for the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines going to warre defend them, and the women whych abyde at home conſerue them. As now .iiii. yeares paſſed ye ſaw this great peſtilence: and I demaund then to haue account of the people, and I found that of C. and xl.M. honeſt women .lxxx.M. dyed: &amp; of .x.M. dyſhoneſt women in maner they ſcaped al. I cannot tel for which I ſhould wepe, eyther for the lacke that we haue of the good &amp; vertuous wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our comon wealth, or els for the great hurt &amp; domages that theſe euil &amp; wicked women do to the youth of Rome. The fyer that brenneth in mount <hi>Ethna</hi> doth not ſo much endomage thoſe that dwel in <hi>Scicil,</hi> as one euyl woman doth with in the walles of Rome. A fyerſe beaſt, and a perillous ennemy to the common wealth is an euyl wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for ſhe is of power to commyt all euyls, and nothing apte to do anye good O how many realmes and kingdomes rede we of, whych by the euil behauiours of one woman haue bene loſt, and to reſiſt agaynſt them, there hath bene nede both of wiſedome, perils, money, and force of many men.</p>
                     <p>The vyces in a woman is as a grene rede that boweth euery waye: but the lightnes and dyſhoneſty is as a dry kyxe that breaketh, in ſuch wiſe that the more euyl they vtter, the more vnlykely is the amendment therof.</p>
                     <p>Behold <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> ther is no creature that more deſireth honour and worſe ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth it, then a woman, and that this is true, we ſe by iuſtice, by orations, by writyng, and other trauailes, man getteth fame &amp; renowme: but withoute it be by flattering, and faire ſpeakyng, this houre by auncient writers we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rede of few women or none, whych eyther by writyng, redyng, workyng with nedle, ſpinning, or by weauing, haue gotten them any great renowme. But as I ſay of one, I ſay of an other, certaynely of diuers we rede, by ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them cloſe in their houſes, being wel occupyed in their buſines, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in their words, faithful to their huſbands, wel ordred in their perſons, peaſable with their neighbours, and finally for being honeſt amonge their owne family, and ſhamefaſt amongeſt ſtraungers, they haue obteined great renowme in their life, and lefte a perpetuall memorie of theym after their death. I wil tel you an auncyent hiſtory as profitable to reſtraine our vices, as it dyd then augment vertues, whych is this. The realme of the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth, was a long tyme as diſſolute through the vnthriftines of women, as infamed by the vyces of men, ſo that of al nations they were cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led barbarous, what time Greece of the philoſophers, was called the mother of phyloſophers, <hi>Licurgus</hi> a wiſe phyloſophers in knowledge, and a right iuſt king in gouernaunce, partly with his doctrine very profitable, &amp; partly with his lyfe moſt pure, ordeyned lawes in the ſayd realme, wherby he expelled all vyces, and planted al vertues. I cannot tel whych of theſe two were moſte happieſt, the kyng hauynge ſo obedyent people, or els the realme to haue ſoo worthy a kinge. Among other lawes for women he enacted one worthye of hyghe commendacion, the whiche commaunded, that the father whych dyed ſhoulde geue nothynge to his doughter: and another, that neither liuing nor dieng he ſhold geue any money to mary her with, to thintent that none ſhould take her for her goodes, but al onlye for her vertues: and not for her beautye but for her qualyties: wher as nowe ſome be forſaken by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:21411:361"/>
where as now ſome be forſaken becauſe they are poore, ſoo then they abode vnmaried becauſe they were vicious, O time worthye to be deſired, when maydens hoped not to be maried with their fathers goodes, but by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous workes of their owne perſons, this was the time called the golden world, when neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doughter feared to be diſherited by the father in his lyfe, nor the father to dye ſorowfull for leuynge her without dowrye at his death. O Rome, curſed be he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> firſt brought gold into thy houſe, &amp; curſed be he that firſt began to horde vp treaſour. Who haue made Rome to be ſo rich of treaſure, and ſo poore of vertues? who hath cauſed noble men to mary the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> &amp; leaue the doughters of Senatours vnmaryed? what hath made that the rich mannes doughter is demaunded vnwillyng, &amp; the doughters of a poore man none wil deſire? What hath cauſed that one marieth a foole w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fyue hundreth markes, rather then a wiſe woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ten thouſand ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues? then I wil not ſay that in this caſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh vanquiſhed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleſh, but I ſay that vanity is ouercome of malyce. For a couetous perſon wil ſoner now a daies take a wife that is rich &amp; foule, then one that is poore and faire: O vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie woman that bring forth chyldren, and more vnhappie be the dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are borne: the which to take in mariage no man deſireth, neyther for the bloud of their predeceſſours, nor the fauour of their frendes, nor the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynes of their perſons, nor for the purity of their lyues. O wicked worlde, where the doughter of a good man without moneye ſhal haue no mariage: but it was not wont to be ſo. For in the old time when they treated of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, firſt they ſpake of the perſons, and after of the goods, not as they do at this preſent in this vnhappie time: for now they ſpeake firſt of the goods &amp; laſt of al of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſons. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaid golden world, firſt they ſpake of the vertues that the perſon was endewed with: and when they were maried, as it were in ſport they would ſpeake of the goods. When <hi>Camillus</hi> triumphed ouer the <hi>Gauls,</hi> he had then but one ſonne, and he was ſuch one that his deſertes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryted great praiſe, &amp; for the renowne of his father, dyuers kinges deſired to haue him to their ſonnes, and diuers ſenatours deſired to haue him to their ſonne in law. This yong man being of the age of xxx. yeres, &amp; the father at lx. was importunately ſtirred by his natural frends, and deſires of ſtraunge kings, for to marie him, but alway the old <hi>Camille</hi> withſtode y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> concel of his frends &amp; the importunity of the ſtraungers. When it was demaunded why he determyned not vpon ſome mariage for his ſonne, ſyth thereby ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the quyet life of the man, &amp; the ioy of himſelfe in his age, he aunſwered. I wil not mary my ſonne, becauſe ſome offer me rich doughters, ſome noble of linage, ſome yong, and ſome faire. But ther is none hath ſayd to me, I geue you my vertuous doughter. Certenly <hi>Camil</hi> merited triumphe for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did, and deſerued eternal memory for that he ſayde. I ſpake to you <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> all theſe words, becauſe I ſe you leade your doughter to theatres, and playes, and bring her into the capitolle, you put her to the keaping of the ſword plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, you ſuffer her to ſee the tumblers, &amp; yet do you not remember that ſhe is yong, and you not to aged, you go into the ſtreates withoute lycence, and ſporte you by the ryuers: I finde no vyllannye therin, nor thynke that youre doughter is euyl, but I ſaye it, bycauſe you geue occaſion that ſhe ſhoulde not bee good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:362"/>Beware, beware <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> neuer truſt to the race of fleſh of yong people, nor haue no confidens in old folkes: for ther is no better way, then to flye the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of al things.</p>
                     <p>For this intent the virgins veſtalles are cloſed vp betwene the walles, to eſchew the occaſions of open places, not to be more lyght and folyſhe, but to be more ſad &amp; vertuous flieng occaſions. The yong ſhal not ſay, I am yong and vertuous: nor the old ſhal not ſay, I am old and broken. For of neceſſity the dry flaxe wil bren in the fier, &amp; the grene flagge ſmoke in the flame.</p>
                     <p>I ſay though a man be a dyamond ſet among men, yet of neceſſitie he ought to be quicke, and to melt as waxe in the heate amonge women, we cannot deny that thoughe the wood be taken from the fyer and the Imbers quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: yet neuertheles the ſtones oftentime remaine hotte.

                     <p>What nede is it to blaſe the vertues, and deny our naturalyties? certein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ther is not ſo old a horſe, but if he ſe a mare wil ney once or twiſe: ther is no man ſo yong nor old but let him ſe faire yong damoſels, eyther he wil gyue a ſigh, or a wiſhe. In al voluntarie things I deny not, but that one maye be vertuous: but in natural thinges, I confeſſe euery man to be weake. When you take the wood from the fier, it leaueth burnyng: when ſommer cometh the cold winter ceaſeth: when the ſea is calme, the waues leaue their vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mocions: when the ſonne is ſet, it lightneth not the world. I wil ſay, that then, and not before, the fleſh wil ceaſe to trouble vs, when it is layd in the graue, of the fleſh we are borne, in the fleſh we lyue, and in the fleſhe we ſhal dy: &amp; therby it foloweth, that our good lyfe ſhal ſoner end, then our fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires forſake vs, oftentimes ſome holſome fleſhe corrupteth in an euill veſſel, and good wine ſometime fauoreth of the foiſt. I ſay, though that the workes of our life be vertuous: yet ſhal we fele the ſtench of the weake fleſh. I ſpake this <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> ſith that age cannot reſiſt theſe hot appitites, howe can the tender members of youth reſiſt them? vnleſſe you that are the mother go the right way, how ſhould the doughter that foloweth you find it? the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine matrons, if they wil bringe vp their doughters wel, oughte to kepe theſe rules, when they ſe that they would wander abrode, that they breake their legges: and if they ſhould be gaſing: then put out their eyes: and if they wil lyſten, ſtoppe their eares: if they wil geue or take, cut of their hands: if they dare ſpeake, ſow vp their mouthes: if they wyl pretende any lightnes, burye them quycke: death ought to be geuen to an euyl doughter, in ſtede of her dowry: for gyftes, geue her wormes, and for her houſe, a graue.</p>
                     <p>Take hede <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> if you wil haue much ioy of your doughter take from her the occaſions wherby ſhe ſhal be euyl.

O how many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyl hath there bene, not becauſe they would be ſo, but becauſe they folowed ſuch occaſions, the which they ought to haue eſchewed. It is at my pleaſure to enter into this battaile, but yet it is not in my power to attaine the vyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, it is for me to enter into the ſea, yet it lyeth not in my handes to eſcape

the peril: it is in the hands of a woman to enter into the occaſion, and after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe is therin, it is not in her power to eſcape from euill, to delyuer her from tongues. Peraduenture <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> thou wilt ſay to me, none can ſpeake to your doughter <hi>Lucil,</hi> vnleſſe thou heareſt it: nor ſe her, but thou ſeeſt him: nor conuey her, but thou knoweſt where: nor make any appointment, withoute thy conſent: and yet thou knoweſt, that thoſe whych wil her euyl, ſeke wyth their tongues to dyſhonour her: and thoſe that with their hartes loue her, ſpeake only in their harts. We loue in yong bloud, in the ſpringing tyme and floryſhing youth is a poyſon, that forthwith ſpreadeth into euery vaine, it is a herbe that entreth into the entrayles, a ſwowning that incontinently mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyfieth al the members, and a peſtilence that ſleeth the harts, and finallye it maketh an end of al vertues. I know not what I ſaye, but I fele y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which I would ſay, for I would neuer blaſe loue with my tongue, except I were ſore wounded therwith in my hart. <hi>Ouide</hi> ſaith in his boke of the art of loue, loue is I wot not what, it commeth I know not from whence, who ſent it I wot not, it engendreth I know not how, it is ſatiſfied I wot not wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with, it is felt, &amp; I wot not how, oft it ſleeth, I wot not wherfore, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without breakyng the fleſh outwardly, loue taketh roote, and moleſteth the hart inwardly. I know not what <hi>Ouide</hi> meaneth hereby, but I trowe when he ſaid theſe words, he was as farre banyſhed from him ſelfe, as I am at this tyme from my ſelfe. O <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> they that loue together, vtter the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes of theyr harts by dyuers wayes, and in ſleaping they reaſon &amp; ſpeake &amp; by ſygnes they vnderſtand ech other.

And to thintent that ye ſhal not thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſpeake fables, I wil proue this by aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hiſtories, we find aunciently, that in the yere .cclxx. after the foundacion of Rome. <hi>Etraſco</hi> a yong Romaine that was dombe, and <hi>Verona</hi> a fayre Lady of the Latines which was dombe alſo, theſe two ſaw ech other on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mount Cel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o at the feaſtes, and ther fel in loue togethers, and their hartes were as ſore fixed in loue, as their tongues were tyde from ſpeach. It was a maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing to ſe then, &amp; fearful to note now that this yonge lady came from <hi>Salon</hi> to Rome: &amp; he went from Rome to <hi>Salon</hi> ſundry times by the ſpace of 30. yeres, without the knowledge of any parſon, and neuer ſpake together. It chaunced at the laſt that the huſband of the lady <hi>Verona</hi> died, &amp; the wife of <hi>Etraſco</hi> alſo, and then they diſcouered their loue, and treated a mariage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene them. And theſe two dombe parſons had iſſue a ſonne of whom deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble linage of our <hi>Scipions,</hi> which were more famous in the feates of armes, then their father &amp; mother were troubled for want of words.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Fauſtine</hi> marke thys thing, it had litle auailed to haue cut out the ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues of the two dombe perſons to haue remedyed their loue, and not to haue cut out their harts. And I ſhal tel you of <hi>Maſiniſſa</hi> a worthy knight of <hi>Numidie,</hi> and <hi>Sophoniſsa</hi> a famous lady of Carthage, al only by one ſighte as they ſawe eche other on a ladder, he declareth his deſyre vnto her and ſhee knowyng hys luſt breakynge the oores of feare, and lyftyng vp the ankers of ſhame, incontinente rayſed the ſayles of their hartes, and wythe the
<pb facs="tcp:21411:363"/>
ſhippes of their perſones they ioyned ech to other, here may we ſee, how the firſt ſight of their eyes, the knowledge of their parſons, the conſent of their harts, the copulacion of their bodyes, the decay of their eſtates, and the loſſe of their names, in one day, in one houre, in one moment, and in one ſtep of a ladder were loſt, what wil you that I ſay more to this purpoſe? do you not knowe what <hi>Heleyne</hi> the Greke, and <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Troyan,</hi> of two ſtraunge naci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of farre countreis, with one only ſight in a temple their willes wer ſo knit together, that he toke her as his captiue, and ſhe abode his priſoner. In <hi>Paris</hi> appeared but ſmal force, and in <hi>Heleyne</hi> but litle reſiſtence, ſo that in maner thoſe two yong perſons, the one procuring to vanquyſhe, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffring to be vanquiſhed: <hi>Paris</hi> was cauſe of his fathers death, and they both of their owne deaths, loſſe to their realmes, &amp; ſcaunder to al the world. Al this loue grew of one onely ſight. When great kinge <hi>Alexander</hi> woulde haue geuen battaile to the <hi>Amoſones,</hi> the quene (captaine of theym) no leſſe faire then ſtrong and vertuous, came to a riuer ſide, &amp; the ſpace of an houre eche of theym behelde an other with their eyes, withoute vtteringe of anye worde.</p>
                     <p>And when they retourned to their tentes, their fierſnes was turned into ſwete wanton amorous wordes. When <hi>Pirius</hi> the faithfull defender of the <hi>Tharrentines,</hi> and renowmed king of <hi>Epirotes</hi> was in Italy, he came into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and had not bene there but one daye, but he was enamoured of a faire lady named <hi>Gemelicia,</hi> of a high lignage, and greatly eſteamed of her beauty, and the very ſame day ſhe was gotten with child, and ſhamed throughoute al Italy, and caſt out of the citie: &amp; after that ſhe was delyuered of child, ſhe was ſlayne by one of her owne bretherne. Alſo <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in the prouince of <hi>Bithiny,</hi> in the wood <hi>Sechin</hi> made a goodly banket of <hi>Marcus Anthonius</hi> her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and though ſhe was not very honeſt, yet had ſhe with her chaſt wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> And thus the banket endured a great part of the night. And the wood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thicke, yong damoſels were not ſo wily to hide them, but the yong men Romaynes found them: ſo that of .60. doughters of the ſenatours, 55. were gotten with child among the thicke buſhes, whych thing made a great ſclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the people, &amp; augmented the infamy of <hi>Marcus Anthonius.</hi> Thus as I haue ſhewed of a ſmall number, I could ſay of many other. Al men are not men, nor al women are not women. I ſpeake it, bycauſe I would it ſhould be ſayd, let it touch them that it toucheth, &amp; let them that come vnderſtande me. Ther are ſome ſhips whych are ſo lyght, that they wil ſayle with a lytel wind. And ther be other ſome mils that wil grind with a lytle water. I ſay ther be ſome women ſo brickle, that as a glaſſe with a phylyppe will breake, and wil ſlyppe with a lytle mire.</p>
                     <p>Tel me <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> haue you ſuffred your doughter to ſpeake but with her vncles, and kepe company but with her couſins? I ſay in thys caſe that the mother is in as muche blame, as the doughter in peril. Do you not knowe that the hotte fire dooth not forbeare the woode, be it wete or drye: but in likewiſe it conſumeth the hard ſtones? Do you not know, that the extreame hunger cauſeth beaſtes to deuoure with their owne teeth, the thynge that was bread in their entrayles? Do you not know, that the gods made a lawe ouer al thinges, excepte ouer louers, becauſe they maye not abyde it? and
<pb facs="tcp:21411:363"/>
doubtleſſe it was right wiſely done. Rome condempneth not theſe foolyſhe innocents, becauſe they haue no vnderſtandynge. The gods geue no paine to amorous people, becauſe they are depriued from reaſon. Ye know when I was cenſour, ther was a yonge woman whiche had a child by her owne father, and another had a chyld by her ſonne, and a niece by her proper vncle: and ther was ſentence geuen on them, that the father ſhould be giuen to the lions, and the chyldren buried quycke, and the mothers were brente in the campe of <hi>Mars.</hi> The matter was ſo horrible to here, that I myght not endure to ſe the curſed men, and I commaunded by my decrees, that none ſhould be ſoo bolde to ſpeake in ſuche a caſe anye more.</p>
                     <p>And if this caſe were feareful to men, then certaynlye the Romaine Matrones oughte to lyue chaſtlye. Then if the fire of the father doo chafe the doughter, inflameth kinſefolke, and burneth theym ſelfe: yee maye bee ſure if hee finde eyther coſin, or faire ſiſter, the flames of his concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence wil not leaue to take hold on her, for any parentage. If this riotous fleſh wil obey reaſon, then it may be that your doughter may ſpeake lyberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with her coſins, but ſith that paſſion repugneth ſo much at reaſon, I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle you, truſt not to much in her bretherne. You ſe by experience, that the worme that is bred in the timbre, and the mothes which are bred in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, eateth that ſame cloth. I ſay that ſometime a man bringeth him vp in his houſe, whych afterward taketh his honour and life from him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> take this that I haue ſaid for a warnyng, and theſe laſt wordes I giue you counſaile. If you will kepe your ſelfe from thoughte, and youre doughter from peril, let your doughter be alwaies occupied with ſome good works: for when the handes are occupied with any good exercyſe, then the hart is voyde from many idle and vaine thoughts. Euery lightnes done in youth, breaketh downe a lompe of our lyfe: but ydleneſſe wherby our enuye entereth, is it which openeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate of al vyces. Knoweſt thou <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> from whence procedeth the vndoing of the yong Romaine doughters? I wil tel the: for as ſone as they be borne, they preſume to be amorous, they as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful (with the recheleſnes of the father, and wantonnes of the mothers) diſpiſe the honeſt trauailes, and embrace the pleaſaunt ydlenes. Of ydle moci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and outragious thoughtes, the eyes take lycence without leaue, the mynd altereth, and the wil is hurt. And finally, thinking to be the white that amorous men ſhoote at, they remayne as a but ful of al vices. And in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ther is nothing that more chaſeth the bal of the thought in this play then the hand ſet a worke therwith.</p>

Then it is ſo, that one of the ſaid princeſſes his doughter being of age, and of wil to be maried, her father ſeing her importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to accomplyſhe her deſire: bycauſe he was ſicke, he ſent for <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> that ſhe ſhould go and talke in the ſenate: the which with al her power ſhe with ſtode, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſecretly ſhe had treated for an other mariage for her dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and openly ſhe excuſed her ſelfe, ſaying that her doughter was to yonge and tender of age. And as the goddes had geuen age ſufficient to the father, ſo had not the doughter of yeres. When themperour vnderſtode this, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Fauſtine</hi> to his bed ſide wheras he lay, and ſayd: diuers things are diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in perticuler perſons, the leaſt of them is not to be ſuffered in them which are gouernours of other, the prince is neuer well obeied, oneleſſe he hath good crede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce among his people. I ſay this <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> becauſe you do one thing in ſecrete, &amp; ſay another openly: herein faileth the credence of ſo high a lady, &amp; putteth in ſuſpect the auctority of ſo great an empire. If you ſuppoſe my good deſires be ſiniſter in your hart, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wealth of your owne children: how ſhould we hope then in any of your good workes, for the children of ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers? It ſemeth to you better to giue your doughter to them, that demaund her of the mother, and refuſe them that the father doth choſe. Certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are a woman you deſire pardon, but in that you are a mother you augment your fault. Do you not know that mariages are guyded ſome by fortune, and ſome by vertues &amp; wiſedome? Such as demaund the dough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the fathers, beleue me, theyr eyes be more vpon their owne proper v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, then vpon the wealth of another. I know wel you bring forth the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but the goddes will mary them, ſyth they haue endewed them with ſo marueilous beauty. Do you not know that the beautye of women ſetteth ſtraungers, on deſire, and putteth neighbours in ſuſpection? to great men it geueth feare, to meane men enuy: to the parents infamy, and peril to the per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſons them ſelues? with great paine it is kepte, that is deſyred of many. Of truth I ſay, the beauty of women is nothing but a ſigne for idle folke, &amp; an early waking for them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be light, wheras of ſtraung deſires lieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> renowne of themſelues, and I denye not, but that a lyght perſon ſercheth ſoner a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with a faire face, then one of an honeſt lyfe. But I ſay that a woman that is maried, onely for her beauty, maye hope in her age to haue an euyll life. It is an infallyble rule, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe that was maried for her fayreneſſe, ſhal be deſpiſed for her fouleneſſe.</p>
                     <p>O what trouble he offereth hymſelfe vnto, whych marieth a fayre woman It behoueth hym to ſuffer her pride: for beauty, &amp; folly, alway go together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:364"/>Alſo he muſt ſuffer her expences, for follye in the heade, &amp; beauty in the face, be two wormes which freate the lyfe, and waſt the goods.</p>
                     <p>Alſo he muſt ſuffer her riots, for a faire woman wil that none but ſhe haue her commaundements in the houſe. Alſo he muſt ſuffer her nice minions, for many faire women wil paſſe their lyues in pleaſure. Alſo he muſt ſuffer her preſumption, for euery faire woman wil haue prehemenence before al other. Finally he that marieth with a faire woman, putteth himſelfe in great ieo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy. And I ſhal tel you wherfore, ſurely <hi>Carthage</hi> was neuer ſo enuyroned with <hi>Scipions,</hi> as the houſe of a faire woman is with light perſons.</p>
                     <p>O vnhappie huſband when his ſpirite is at reſt, and the body ſleping, then thoſe lyght perſons ronne about the houſe, ſleying his body with ieloſye, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting their eyes at the windowes, ſcalyng the walles with ladders, ſinging ſwete ſonges, playing on dyuerſe inſtruments, watching at the gates, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge with bandes, vncoueringe the houſe, and waytinge at euerye corner therof.</p>
                     <p>Al theſe things in caſe they ſhoote at the pricke of womans beautie, they leaue not to ſhoote at the butte of the ſorowful huſbands good name: &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be true or not, let them aſke my ſelfe that am maried with your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auty, and let them wite of my renowne that go ſo about the cytie.</p>
                     <p>I ſay much, but truly I fele more: no man complayneth of the goddes, for geuyng him a foule wife amonge his deſtinies, whyte ſiluer is not wrought, but in blacke pitche: and the tender tree is not preſerued but by the harde barke. I ſaye a man that marieth a foule wife, leadeth a ſure lyfe, let euerye man choſe as he lyſteth: &amp; I ſay a man that marieth a faire wife: caſteth his good name at haſard, and putteth his life in peril. Al the infamy of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours ſtode in exerciſing of deedes of armes, and now al the paſtime of the Romaine youthe, is to ſerue Ladies. When a woman is bruted to be fayre, then euery man goeth thither, &amp; taketh great payne to ſerue her, &amp; the woman wil be ſene. I ſay <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> you neuer ſaw a damoſel Romaine great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly renowmed in beauty, but eyther in dede, or in ſuſpicion, there went ſome euyl report of her name. In that lytle that I haue red, I haue herd of diuers fayre women, both of Grece, Italy, Parth, &amp; Rome, and they be not in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morye becauſe they were faire, but for the great perils and miſaduentures whych through their beautyes chaunced in the world. For by reaſon of their excellent beautyes they were vyſited in their owne lands, &amp; for their infamy ſhamed through al the world. When the realme of <hi>Carthage</hi> flouriſhed in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and was fortunate in armes, they ruled the common wealth by wyſe phyloſophers, &amp; that they repulſed their enemyes by ſtrong armes. <hi>Arminius</hi> the phyloſopher was as greatly eſteamed among the <hi>Carthagians</hi> as <hi>Homere</hi> was amonge the <hi>Grekes,</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi> amonge the Romaines. He lyued in this world .122 yeres .80. of the which good yeares he lyued moſt quyetly, he was as much turned from women, as geuen to his bookes. Then the ſenate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had ſuch experience in the affayres of the weale publyke, &amp; ſo withdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen from al natural recreations, they deſired him with great inſtaunce to be maried, to thintent the memory might be had of ſo excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a wiſe man in time to come, &amp; the more importune they were, the more he reſiſted, and ſaid.</p>
                     <p>I wil not be maried: for if ſhe be foule, I ſhal abhorre her. Yf ſhe be riche
<pb facs="tcp:21411:365"/>
I muſt ſuffer her. If ſhe be poore, I muſt mainteine her. If ſhe be faire, I muſt take hede of her. If ſhe be a ſhrew I cannot ſuffer her. And the leſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence of al thoſe is ſufficient to ſlea a .M. men. With ſuch words this wiſe man excuſed himſelfe. But in the end through great ſtudy in his age, he loſt his ſight, wherby the ſolytarines of his ſwete lybertye, conſtrayned him to take the company of a woman, by whom he had a doughter, of the whyche deſcended the noble <hi>Amilears</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> competitours of the <hi>Scipions,</hi> of Rome. The which ſhewed no leſſe worthineſſe in the defence of <hi>Carthage,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oures did courage in the amplifiyng of Rome. Tel me <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> may not ſuch ſuſpicion fal vpon your doughter, though her vertue ſuccour her in the peril, and her honeſtie aſſure her perſon? I wil diſcouer a ſecret thing to you. Ther is nothing that can chaunce euyl to a woman, if ſhe be enuironed with fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine ſhamefaſtnes. Greatly they deſire, and with much importunytie they procure thoſe thinges which highly may be attayned. There is nothing ſoo certaine as this, that the wealth of an other, is the cauſe of his owne euil. And <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> ye know, that the moſt honeſt women, by our malyce are moſt deſired. Certainly their ſhamefaſtnes, and keping cloſe, be arrowes in defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our honeſtie. We reade not that the bloud, riches, nor beauty of the vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie matrone <hi>Lucrece,</hi> were the cauſe that ſhe was deſired: but the beautie of her vyſage, the grauytie of her perſonne, the honeſty of her lyuing, the keping of her ſelfe cloſe in her houſe, the ſpendyng of her time and credite among her neighboures, &amp; the great renowne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe had among ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, prouoked the foliſh <hi>Tarquine</hi> to comit with her adultrye by force. What thinke you? wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of came this? I ſhal ſhew you. We that be euyl, are ſo euyl, that we vſe euil the goodnes of them that be good. The fault hereof is not in the Ladyes of Rome, but rather in the immortal goddes. Their cleane honeſtye, declareth our cruel malice. <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> you ſay your doughter is to yong to be maried. Do you not know, that the good father oughte to endoctrine his ſonnes frome their age: and to prouide for his doughters whyles they be yonge? Of a trouth, if the fathers be fathers, and the mothers mothers: as ſone as the goddes haue geuen them a daughter, forthwith they ought to be myndfull therof, and neuer forget it, til they haue prouided her a huſband. The fathers ought not to tary for riches, nor the mother for her linage, the better to mary them: ſo what with the one and the other, the time paſſeth, and the doughter waxeth aged: and in this maner they be to old to be maried, and to lyue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not, ſo that they themſelues liue in paine, the fathers in thought, and the parentes in ſuſpection leaſt they ſhould be caſt away. O what great ladyes haue I knowen, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doughters of great ſenatours, which not for fault of richs, nor of vertues in their perſons, but al only for differring of time, and driuyng from one houre to an other, ſo that at laſt ſodaine death come to the fathers, and no prouiſion was made for the doughters. So that ſome were couered vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth, after their death, &amp; others buried with forgetfulnes, being alyue. Eyther I lye, or els I haue red in the lawes of the Rhodians theſe wordes.</p>
                     <p>We commaund the father in maryinge tenne ſonnes, to trauaile but one daye: but to mary one vertuous doughter let hym trauaile ten yeares, yea and hazarde his bodye in the water vppe to the chinne, ſweate droppes of
<pb facs="tcp:21411:365"/>
of bloude, alter the ſtomake, diſherite all his ſonnes, loſe his goodes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture his perſon. Theſe words in this law were pitiful for the doughters, &amp; no leſſe graue for the ſonnes. For .x. ſonnes by the law of men, are bound to go ouer al the world: but the doughter by this good law, ought not to go out of the houſe. I ſay moreouer, that as things vnſtable thret fallyng, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wiſe it chaunceth to yong damoſels, which thinketh al their time loſt and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, vnto the day of their mariage. <hi>Homere</hi> ſayth, it was the cuſtome of ladyes of Grece to count the yeres of their life, not from the time of their birth, but from the time of their mariage. As if one demaunded a Grecian her age, ſhe would aunſwere .20. yeres, if it were .20. ſithe ſhe was maried: though it wer .60. yeres ſith ſhe was borne. Affirming after they had a houſe to gouerne and to commaund, that day ſhe beginneth to liue. The Melon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is ripe, and abydeth ſtill in the gardeine, cannot eſcape, but eyther it muſt be gathered, or els it rotteth. I ſay the mayden that tarieth long tyll ſhe be maried, can not eſcape eyther to be taken, or infamed. I wil ſaye no more As ſone as the grapes be ripe, it behoueth that they be gathered: ſo it is neceſſary that the woman that is come to perfect age be maried. And the father that doth this, caſteth peril out of his houſe, bringeth himſelfe out of care, and getteth much contentacion of his doughter.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>MArke</hi> oratour Romaine, borne at mount Celio, to <hi>Piramon</hi> of <hi>Lion,</hi> my great frend, deſireth health to thy perſon, and ſtrengthe and vertue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy ſiniſter fortune. In the thirde kalendes of Ianuarye I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued thy letter, wherby I perceiue thou haſt receyued one of myne. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not much thy words, but I eſteame greatlye thy meanynge. So that without declaring therof, I haue gathered the ſentence. Reaſon would, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I haue writen ſo often to the, that thou ſhouldeſte the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me: but thou art ſo ſlouthful, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though I call the, thou wilt not heare: nor though I ſtrike the, thou wilt not fele. But now to come to the purpoſe. Thou knoweſt <hi>Piramon</hi> how nere we be in parentage, auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in frendſhip, ſtedfaſt in loue, and tender of herts, &amp; how faithful in al things, wherin one true frend might proue another. Thou remembreſt well, when we were at Rhodes, that we dwelled together in one houſe, and did eate at one table: &amp; al that thou thoughteſt, I did it in effect: and that I ſayd, thou neuer gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaydeſt. Certainly thou were in my harte, and I in thine entrailes. I was thine, and thou were myne. We being together, it ſemed to al other that we were but one, &amp; of one wil. What a matter is this? Thou writeſt how thou art heauy, &amp; yet thou doeſt not tel the cauſe why. Thou complayneſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou art almoſt dead, and thou ſheweſt me not who taketh from the thy life. If thou wilt not ſhew to me thy troubles, ſith thou art my frende, I wil thou know that I demaund it of right. If thou wilt not, I wyl that thou know, that the piteful gods haue determyned, that al pleaſures &amp; ioye ſhal departe from my houſe: and that al heuines &amp; ſorowes ſhal be lodged in my perſon. Sith I am prince of al honor in tribulacion, if thou wouldeſt, thou canſt not eſcape out of my ſiegnory. For if thou complaine that thou art vnhappye in fortune, then I eſteme my ſelfe to be happie in vnhappines. I demaund one

thing of the: when haſt thou ſene me haue ſufficient, and thou nede? when haſt thou ſene me ſlepe, and thou wake? and when haſt thou trauailed, and I reſted? Of trouth ſith the goods and perſons are their owne proper, the trauailes and euil aduentures are alwaies common One thing thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to know, if in myne amytie thou wilt perſeuer, that all my goodes are thine, &amp; al thyne euyls are myne, ſith thou was borne to pleaſure, &amp; I to trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble. I ſay not this fainyngly: for thou haſte had experience of me that when <hi>Maria</hi> thy ſiſter died (who was no leſſe vertuous then faire) thou perceiuedſt wel when ſhe was w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> earth couered dead, I was with ſorowes ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med alyue, and at the ſowne of my teares thine eyes daunced. Sythe thou haſt ſuch confidence in my perſon, ſurely thou maiſt diſcouer to me thy paine. Yet as often as I haue demaunded, there hath no famed excuſes wanted. I require the, and deſire the againe, and in the name of the Gods I pray the, and in their names I coniure the, that thou powre al thy ſorowes into mine entrailes. For from that way that thou goeſt, I wil not depart one iote: if thou goeſt, I wil go: if thou reſt, I wil reſt: if thou worke I wil worke: if thou leaue of, I wil do the ſame: if thou wilt die, know thou I wil not liue, Loke frend what thou wilt do: For thy troubles &amp; myne, torment both one hart. If thou haue diſpleaſure, al things dyſpleaſe me: if thou wepe, I ſwer fro henceforth neuer to laugh: if thou diſcharge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> of thy paine, fro henceforth I ſhal take it for myne: if thou go alone, I wil forſake company, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with lyue ſolytarilie. What wilt thou that I ſhould deſire? For al that euer thou wylt I wyl. Thou complaineſt that in al thy trauayles thou canſt find no parent to remedy the nor frend to councel the. I ſweare to the frend <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramon,</hi> that of theſe, ii. things I haue as great nede in my houſe, as thou haſt ſorow in thine. I know wel the remedy ſhould come by riches, and by coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cel, and conſolacion of them that be wiſe. And by reaſon of my heauy deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, ſlou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>h hath taken from me the knowledge of wiſedome: and fortune wil not permyt me to haue great riches. Certainly I wepe for my myſerie, and yet there is but ſmal remedy in me.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſayſt in thy letter, that thy neyghbours and frends in promyſinge haue behight the many things: but in performyng it they do nothyng. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I maruaile not, for the vertuous hand is not bound to make the tongue a foole. Truly our fete daunce, our hands ſhould worke at the ſowne of the tongue: our lyfe endeth in few days, and our renowme in fewer.</p>
                     <p>Promyſe is an auncient cuſtome among the children of vanytie, and of cu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtome the tongue ſpeaketh haſtely, and the hands worke at leiſure. Now let vs ſpeake more particularly. Thou oughteſt not to complayne, in that thou findeſt not but in few, that dyuers haue founde in the alone: it haue bene a cuſtome to receiue merelye, and willyngly, but to geue ſlowly, and with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyl wil. They that be preſumptuous do the one, &amp; they whych be the ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful do the other. The Greekes ſaye, that he that promyſeth, and is longe in fulfillynge, is but a ſlacke frende.</p>
                     <p>We Romaynes ſay, that he is much better that denyeth forth with, becauſe he doth not deceiue him that aſketh. In this caſe I ſaye, he that maye geue and geueth not, is an open ennemye: and he that promyſeth foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and is longe before hee perfourme it, it is but a ſuſpicious frende
<pb facs="tcp:21411:366"/>
What nede wordes to our frendes, when we may ſuccour the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with works? It is not right, to whom we geue our hartes, which is the beſt thing of our heartes: that we geue him our tongue, which is the worſt thing of our liues. In good ſo the the gods wyll not ſuffer in the place of amitie, to deſire any thing of our frende in haſte, and to be driuen of with long delaying. <hi>Plato</hi> in his lawes ſaieth, we commaunde that in our gouerning, politike counſayle be geuen to them that be in proſperitie, to the intent that they decaie not: and to ſuccour them that be in heuines and trouble, to the intent that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire not. Certainly vnder theſe wordes are compriſed diuers great ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Thou knoweſt well, my frende <hi>Piramon,</hi> that ſwete wordes comfort the harte but litle, that is in tribulation, vnleſſe there be ſome good works ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. I wyll not denye, but that they to whome we haue geuen our good wylles in the tyme of our proſperitie, be bounde to geue vs of their goodes, and to ſhewe vs fauour in our aduerſitie. I demaunde one thyng of thee, wherefore holdeſt thou a preſumptuous licence to demaunde, and reproueſt on the other parte the libertie of denyinge? Truly as the ſhamefaſt man ſhould not haue denay, in any of his requeſtes being honeſt: ſo the ſhameles and importunate man ſhould be denayed, what ſo euer he demaundeth.</p>
                     <p>Thou maieſt knowe, if thou knowe it not my frende <hi>Piramon:</hi> that to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to euery thyng that is demaunded, belongeth onely to the Gods. To geue all thing that is demaunded, is the ſigne of a ſeruaunt: and to deny any thing, is a token of libertie. To wepe for that is denied, is the condition of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauntes: to be vnthankefull for that is geuen, is the condition of <hi>Barbarians.</hi> And to haue a ſtoute harte, though thinges are denied, is the guiſe of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines. One of the thinges wherein <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> ſhewed him ſelfe to be of high courage was, that he had moſt greateſt ioy, when the ſenate denayed any thing deſired by hym. Oftentimes he ſayed. There is nothing where in Rome geueth more glory nor renowme to my perſone, then when I ſhewe my ſelfe moſt haſty to demaunde, and ſhe moſte ſtiffe to denay: to the intent that after ſhe ſhould knowe howe great my wyll is to deſire, and howe that my ſtrength is to acquire. Me thinketh it is better to haue recourſe to the gods with vertue, then to diſpleaſe them with vices. And to geue contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thy repoſed wil, when thou ſeeſt thy ſelfe in tribulation: and that thy demaundes of the gods &amp; of men be fruſtrate, thou oughteſt to meaſure it with a right meaſure, &amp; to wey it in a right balaunce, the many things which thei haue geuen thee, &amp; the few thinges which thei haue denied thee. O how vncourteous be we to the gods, &amp; vngratious to men, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we miniſh with forgetfulnes that we haue receiued of them: and that litle that hath bene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied vs, we augmente with complaintes? Frende <hi>Piramon,</hi> I am beguiled, if thou be not fifty yeares of age, and all that ſeaſon thou haſte done nothing but receiued giftes: and yet for all that, I haue not ſene thee doe one dayes ſeruice. Certainely it is no reaſon to complayne of eight dayes of euyl for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, beynge fiftie yeares of age. Thou ſayeſt in thy letter howe thou haſte muche payne: becauſe thou knoweſt all thy neyghbours to be enuyous. In good ſothe I haue payne for thy payne, and of thy marueylyng, I haue great marueyle. For all admyration proceadeth of aboundaunce of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, and faulte of experience.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:367"/>Doeth the quicke vnderſtanding of men rule the life of them that be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, that they neade not to thinke of the trauaile to come, hauinge in their handes preſent remedy? If they be hungry, they may eate: when they are colde, they may warme them: if they be drowſy, they may ſleape: when they be wery, they may reſte: when they are ſicke, they may be healed: and when they are heauy, they may reioyce In ſuch maner, that the careful lyfe paſſeth, ſome to make tiltes and liſtes, ſome to make armoure and ſcaffolds, ſome to inuente newe ginnes, and ſome to repaire bulwarkes. I ſaye the world and the flleſhe doe nought els but fighte againſt vs, &amp; we haue nede at all times to defende vs from them. All theſe remedies are againſt the trauayle of the fleaſhe. But what ſhall we doe, that the curſedneſſe of enuie endeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all theſe? Curſed is that wealth, that euery man enuieth. Certainly againſt enuy is no fortreſſe, nor caue to hyde, nor highe hyll to mounte on, nor thicke woode to ſhadowe in, nor ſhippe to ſcape in, nor horſe to beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, nor money to redeme vs. Enuy is ſo venemous a ſerpente, that there was neuer mortall man among mortalles, that could ſcape from the byting of her toothe, ſcratching of her nayles, defyling of her feete, and the caſtinge of her poyſon. I ſweare to thee my frend <hi>Piramon,</hi> that ſuch as fortune lifteth vp with great ryches, ſhe full of crueltie ſoneſt ouerthroweth. Enuy is ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious, that to them whiche of her are moſt denied, and ſet fartheſt of: ſhe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth moſt cruell ſtrokes with her feete. This vnhappy enuy prepareth poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſecretely for them that enioye great pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>I haue red diuerſe bookes of Hebrewe, Greke, Latine, and Caldei. And alſo I haue ſpoken with many excellent wyſe men, to ſee if there might be founde any remedy againſt an enuious man. I confeſſe the truthe: reade all that can be read, and imagen all that can be, demaunde all that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded: and ye ſhall finde none other cure againſt this curſed enuy, but to baniſhe vs fro all the proſperitie, and to dwell in the houſe of aduerſitie. O howe vnhappy are they that be in proſperitie? for iuſtly they that be ſet vp in high eſtate, cannot flie from the peril of <hi>Scilla,</hi> without falling into the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>Caribdis.</hi> They cannot ſcape the peryll, without caſting their treaſures into the ſea. I ſaye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the malady of enuy wyl not ſuffer them to ſcape from death, and the medecine that is applied to them, wyll not aſſure their life. I cannot determine whiche is the beſt, or to ſaye more properly the worſte: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame miſery without the daunger of fortune, or extreame proſperitie that is alwayes threatned to fall. In this caſe to be ſo extreame I wyl not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, ſithe in the one is a perilous life, and in the other renoume is ſure. I ſhall tell thee what wyſe <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayde, when he was purſued with many at Rome. Beholde you Romaines, I holde you not for ſo good, nor my ſelfe ſo euill, to ſaye the trouth alwayes, nor alwayes to make lies. I am certaine that ye beare me no enuy, for that I am not as ye be: but it is, becauſe ye can not be as I am. In this caſe I had rather that my enemies had enuy at my proſperitie, then my frendes at my pouertie.</p>
                     <p>This Oratour ſpake after the appetite of them that be in proſperitie, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to geue remedie to them that be ſorowefull. And after this <hi>Cicero</hi> had ſene the fieldes of <hi>Farſale,</hi> he tooke other councell and remedy, ſuche as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him in Rome. For though <hi>Caeſar</hi> had graunted him his goodes, yet that
<pb facs="tcp:21411:367"/>
turned not his credence and renowme. Surely frende <hi>Piramon,</hi> I knowe no remedy to geue thee againſt enuy, ſith thou ſeeſt al the world ful therof. We ſee how we be the ſonnes of enuy, &amp; we liue with enuy, &amp; die with enuy, &amp; he that leueth moſte riches, leueth the greateſt enuy. The auncient wyſe men counſailed riche men, that they ſhould haue poore folkes nere them: and they admoniſhed the poore, that they ſhould not dwell nere to the riche. And truly it is good reaſon. For the riches of riche me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is the ſeede of enuy to the poore. And becauſe the poore man lacketh, and the riche hath to muche, cauſeth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde among the people. I ſweare by the gods immortall, frende <hi>Piramon,</hi> though they that be euill would that I ſweare falſely, as muche as riches with thought nouriſheth couetiſe, ſo much the enuious nouriſheth enuy ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by. I tel the one thing, and that is, that it is no good councell to flie enuy, &amp; to auoyde the vertue contrary to the ſame. <hi>Homer</hi> ſaith, that in his time there were two Grekes extreame in all extremities: the one was extreame in ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and therefore he was perſecuted by enuy, &amp; that was <hi>Achilles:</hi> and the other was ſore noted of malice, but no man had enuy at him, and that was <hi>Thieſtes.</hi> Certainly I had rather be <hi>Achilles</hi> with his enuy, then <hi>Thieſtes</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Thou knoweſt wel, that we Romaines ſearche not but for reſt in our life, &amp; for honor after death. And ſith it is ſo, it is not poſſible but the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that euery man enuieth his renowme, ought to be exalted in the reſte of his life. And ſithe I ſee thoſe two thinges in thee, ſuch as be my frendes taketh litle thought, for that thine enemies murmure againſt thee. Thou wryteſt to me how they of <hi>Lions</hi> doe well, and are mery: except thy ſelfe, that art heuy, and full of penſiuenes. And ſith they ſhew not to haue pleaſure at thy diſpleaſure, ſhew not thy ſelf diſpleaſed with their pleaſure. For it may chaunce one day they ſhal be ſorowfull, when that thou arte mery: and ſo thou ſhalt be quite with them. In an euil perſone there can be no greater euill, nor in a good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a greater faulte, then to be diſpleaſed with another mans wealthe, &amp; to take pleaſure af another mans harme. And in caſe that all doe vs domage with enuy, yet much more a frend, then the enemy. For of mine enemy I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, &amp; for feare I wil withdrawe: but my frende with his amitie may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile me, &amp; I by my fidelitie ſhall not perceiue. Among all mortall enemies there is none worſe, then a frende that is enuious of my felicitie. <hi>Piramon</hi> my frend, I wil conclude, if thou wilt withdraw thy ſelf fro enemies, then kepe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany with thine own familiar frendes. I wote not what to write more to thee, but with al my harte I lament thy heuines. Thou knoweſt howe thy niece <hi>Bruſia</hi> ſlew with a dagger her owne huſband. I was very ſory for her death, and for the renowme that ſhe left behinde her. <hi>Flauius Priſcus</hi> thine vncle is newly made cenſoure. The proces betwene thy brother <hi>Formio</hi> &amp; <hi>Britio</hi> is determined by the ſenate, and it pleaſeth me right well, that they be frendes, and euery man well contented. The booke intituled the conſolation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines I haue ended, and layde it in the capitol. I haue written it in Greke, and that is the cauſe that I ſent it not to thee. But I doe ſende thee a riche ſwerde, &amp; a faire girdle. <hi>Fauſtine</hi> my wyfe doth ſalute thee, &amp; ſendeth thy wife two ſclaues. The gods be my kepers, &amp; comfort thee in thy preſent heuines.</p>

                     <head>¶ A letter ſent by the Emperour <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> to <hi>Catullus Cenſorius,</hi> that was ſo ſorowefull for the death of <hi>Veriſſimus</hi> the Emperoures ſonne, worthy to be red and noted. Cap. viii.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>MArke</hi> the younge, and newe Cenſour, ſaluteth thee, olde and aunciente <hi>Catullus.</hi> I haue wrytten two letters to thee, and thou haſt made aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to none of them. If it be becauſe thou couldeſt not, I holde my peace: if it be becauſe thou wouldeſt not, then I complayne me: if it be for forgetfulnes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I accuſe thee: if it be becauſe thou ſetteſt litle by me, then I doe appeale thee: if thou haſt dreamed that thou haſt wrytten, I ſaye beleue not in dreames: and if thou wylt not it ſhoulde auayle to glorifie me, as a frende, yet thou mighteſt wryte it, aduertiſing and repreuing me as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſonne: younge vertuous perſones are bounde to honour auncient wyſe men, and no leſſe olde wyſe men ought to endoctrine the younge peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and very young as I am. A iuſt thing it is, that the new forces of youth, ſupplie and ſerue them that are worne by age. For their longe experience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructeth our tender age, and naturall ignoraunce. Youthe is euill applied, when it aboundeth in force of the body, &amp; wanteth the vertues of the mind: and age is honoured, wherein the force dieth outwarde, whereby vertues quickeneth the more inwarde. We may ſee the tree, when the fruite is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, the leaues fall, and when flowers drie, then more grene and perfecte are the rootes. I meane, that when the firſt ſeaſon of youth is paſſed, whiche is the Sommer time: then commeth age called Wynter, and purifieth the fruite of the fleſhe, and the leaues of fauour fal, the flowers of delite wither, and the vynes of hope drye outwarde, then it is ryght, that much better are the rootes of good workes within. They that be olde and auncient, ought to prayſe their good workes, rather then their white heares. For honoure ought to be geuen for the good life, and not for the whyte head. Glorious is that common wealth, and fortunate is that prince, that is lord of young men to trauaile, and auncient perſones to councell. As to regarde the ſuſtaininge of the naturalitie of the lyfe, in likewyſe ought to be conſidered the policy of gouernaunce, the whiche is: that al the fruites come nor drye not al at once, but when one beginneth, another faileth. And in this maner, ye that be aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient teaching vs, and we be obedient, as olde fathers and young pullettes, being in the neſte of the Senate: Of ſome their fethers fallinge, and other younge fethered: and where as the olde fathers can not flie, their trauayles are mainteined by their tender children. Frende <hi>Catullus,</hi> I purpoſed not to wryte one lyne this yeare, becauſe my penne was troubled with thy ſlouthe: but the weakenes of my ſpirite, and the great peril of myne offices, alwayes called on me to demaunde thy councell. This priuiledge the olde wyſe men holde in their houſes where they dwell. They are alwayes lordes ouer them that be ſimple, and are ſclaues to them that be wyſe. I thinke thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten me, thinking that ſithe the death of my dere ſonne <hi>Veriſſimus,</hi> the time hath bene ſo long, that I ſhould forget it. Thou haſt occaſion to thinke ſo, for many thinges are cured in time, which reaſon can not helpe. But in this caſe I can not tell which is the greateſt, thy tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pery, or my dolour. I ſweare to thee by the gods immortall, that the hungry wormes are not ſo puiſſaunt in the entrales of the vnhappy chylde: as the bitter ſorowes are in the heauy
<pb facs="tcp:21411:368"/>
hart of the wofull father. And it is no compariſon, for the ſonne is dead but one tyme, and the heauy father dieth euery momente. What wylt thou more that I ſhould ſaye? But that one ought to haue enuy of his death, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of my lyfe, becauſe in dyeng he lyueth, and in the lyuing I dye. In the miſchaunces of lyfe, and in the great vnconſtancie of fortune, whereas her gyles profiteth but litle, and her ſtrengthe leſſe, I thinke the beſt remedy is to fele it as a man, and diſſimule it as diſcrete and wyſe. If all things as they be felt at heart, ſhould be ſhewed outward with the tongue, I thynke that the wyndes ſhoulde breake the hearte with ſyghinges, and water all the earth with weping. O if the corporal eyes ſawe the ſorowe of the heart, I ſweare to thee, they ſhould ſee more of a drop of bloud ſweatinge within, then all the wepyng that appeareth without. There is no comparyſon of the great dolours of the body, to the leaſt greife of the mynde. For all trauayle of the body, men may finde ſome remedy: but if the heauy heart ſpeake, it is not heard: if it wepe, it is not ſene: if it complaine, it is not beleued. What ſhal the poore harte doe? Abhorre the lyfe, wherwith it dieth: and deſire death, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it liueth. The highe vertues among noble vertuous people, conſiſte not all onely to ſuffer the paſſions of the body, but alſo to diſſimule them of the ſoule. They be ſuche, that alter the humours, and ſhewe it not outward: they brynge a feuer without altering of the poulce, they alter the ſtomacke, they make vs to knele to the earth, to ſuffer the water vp to the mouthe, and to take death without leauing of the lyfe: and finally they length our life, to the intente that we ſhould haue no more trauayle, and denieth vs our graue, to the intent that we ſhould not reſte. But conſidering, as I am troubled with ſorowes, ſo am I voyde of conſolations: for when I haue either deſire of the one, or werynes of the other, I vſe alwayes this remedy: to diſſimule with the tongue, to wepe with the eyes, and to fele it with my heart. I paſſe my lyfe, as he that hoped to leſe all that he hath, &amp; neuer to recouer that that is loſte. I ſaye this, though ye ſee me not nowe make funeral wepinges and waylinges, as I did at the death of my ſonne: yet thinke not but it doeth bren my heart, ſo that with the great heate inward, is conſumed the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of the eyes, for it brenneth al my ſpirites within. Thou mayeſt knowe what an honorable father ſuffereth, to leſe a good childe: in all thinges the gods be liberal, except in geuing vs vertuous children. Where there is abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of great eſtates, there is greateſt ſcarſitie of good inheritours. It is a dolefull thing to heare, and greater pitie to ſee, howe theſe fathers clime to haue rycheſſe, and to ſee their children deſcende to haue viciouſnes. To ſee the fathers honoure their children, and the children to infame their fathers: yea and the fathers to geue reſte to the chyldren, and the chyldren to geue trouble to their fathers: yea and ſometyme the fathers die for ſorowe that their children die ſo ſone, and we ſee their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wepe, becauſe their fathers die ſo late. What ſhould I ſaye more, but that the honoure and ryches that the fathers haue procured with great thought, the chyldren conſume with litle care. I am certayne of one thing, that the fathers may gather ryches with ſtrengthe and crafte to ſuſteyne their children, but the Gods wyll not haue durable, that that is begonne with euyll intention: as that is, whiche is wonne to the preiudice of other, and poſſeſſed with an euyll heyre.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:369"/>And though the heauy deſtinies of the father permit, that the ryches be lefte to their children, to ſerue them in all their vyces for their paſtime: at laſt yet according to their merites, the Gods wyll that the heire and heritage ſhould periſhe. Marke what I ſaye, I had two ſonnes, <hi>Comodus,</hi> and the prince <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſimus,</hi> the yonger is dead, that was greateſt in vertue. Alway I imagined, that whyle the good liued, I ſhould be poore: and nowe that the euill remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, I thinke to be riche. I will tell thee the cauſe, the Gods are ſo pitifull, that to a poore father they neuer geue euill childe: and to a ryche father they neuer geue a good childe. And as in all proſperitie there chaunceth alwayes ſome ſiniſter fortune, either ſone or late: ſo therewith fortune doth arme and apparell vs, wherein ſhe ſeeth we ſhall fall to our greateſt hurte. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gods permit, that the couetous fathers, in gathering with greate trauayle, ſhould die with that hurte, to leaue their ryches to their vicious children. I wepe as muche for my childe that the Gods haue left me, as for him that they haue taken from me. For the ſmall eſtimation of him that ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, maketh immortall memory of him that is dead. The ill reſt and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of them that liue, cauſe vs to ſighe for the company of them that be dead. The ill is alway deſired for his ilneſſe to be dead, and the good alwaye meriteth to haue his death bewayled. I ſaye my frende <hi>Catullus,</hi> I thought to haue loſt wy wytte, when I ſawe my ſonne <hi>Veriſſimus</hi> die: but I tooke comforte againe: for either he of me, or I of him muſt ſee the ende, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the Gods did but lende him to me, and gaue him not, and howe they be inheritours, I to haue the vſe of the fruite. For all thinges is meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the iuſt wyll of the Gods, and not by our inordinate wylles and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. I thinke when they toke away from me my childe, I reſtored him to another, and not that they haue taken myne. But ſithe it is the wyll of the Gods to geue reſt to the good childe, and hurte the father becauſe he is euill: I yelde thankes to theim for the ſeaſon that they haue ſuffered me to enioye his life, and for the pacience that I haue taken for his death. I deſire them to mitigate therewith the chaſticement of their yre. And I deſire, ſith they haue taken away the lyfe from this childe: to plante good cuſtomes in the prince myne other ſonne. I knowe what heauineſſe thou haſte taken in Rome for my ſorow. I praye the Gods to ſende thee ioy of thy children, and that I may rewarde thee with ſome good pleaſure, for that thou haſt wept for my payne. My wyfe <hi>Fauſtine</hi> ſaluteth thee, and truly thou wouldeſt haue had compaſſion to ſee her, for ſhe wepeth with her eies, and ſigheth with her harte, and with her handes hurteth her ſelfe, and curſeth with her tongue. She eateth nothing on the daye, nor ſleapeth in the night. She loueth dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenes, and abhorreth light, and thereof I haue no marueyle: for it is reaſon that for that was nouriſhed in her entrayles, ſhe ſhould fele ſorowe at her hart. And the loue of the mother is ſo ſtrong, that though her childe be dead, and layed in graue, yet alwayes ſhe hath him quicke in her harte. It is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rule, that the perſone that is entierly beloued, cauſeth euer great griefe at his death. And as for me, I paſſe the life right ſorowfully, though I ſhew a ioyfull face, yet I want mirth at my harte. And among wyſe men being ſorowful, and ſhewing their faces mercy, is none other thing but burying the quicke, hauing no ſepulture. And I ſweare by the Gods immortall, I feele
<pb facs="tcp:21411:369"/>
muche more than I haue ſaide. And diuers times me thinke I ſhould fall downe, becauſe I dare not wepe with myne eyes, yet I fele it inwardly in my harte. I would fayne common with thee in diuers thinges. Come I praye thee to <hi>Briette,</hi> to the entent that we may ſpeake together. And ſithe it hath pleaſed the Gods to take my chylde fro me, that I loued ſo well, I would counſayle with thee, that arte my louing frende. But few dayes paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, there came thither an Embaſſadour fro the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> to whom I gaue the moſte parte of my horſes: and fro the fartheſt parte of Spayne, there were brought me eight, of the which I ſend the foure.

                        <hi>MArcus</hi> the new Cenſore, to thee <hi>Catullus</hi> now aged, ſendeth ſalutations. There are ten daies paſte, that in the temple of God <hi>Ianus</hi> I receiued thy letter. And I take that ſame God to witnes, that I had rather haue ſene thy perſone. Thou deſireſt that my letters may be longe, but the ſſhortnes of tyme maketh me to aunſwere thee more briefly, than I would. Thou wylleſt me to geue thee knowledge of the newes here. Therto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were: that it were better to demaunde, if there were any thing remayning here in Rome, or Italy, that is olde. For nowe by our euill deſtinies, all that is good and olde, is ended: and newe thinges, which be euil, nowe begynne. The Emperour, the Conſull, the Tribune, the Senatours, the Ediles, the Flamines, the Pretours, the Centurions, all thinges be newe, ſaue the vere<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tues which be old. We paſſe the time in making newe officers, in deuiſinge newe counſailes, &amp; in rayſing newe ſubſidies. In ſuche wyſe, that there hath bene now mo nouelties within theſe foure yeres, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in time paſſed in .400. yeres. We now aſſemble together .300. to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel in the capitol, and there we bragge and boſte, ſweare and promiſe, that we will exalte the vertuous, and ſubdue the vitious, fauour the right, and not winke at the wrong, puniſhe the euil, and rewarde the good, repayre olde, and edefie new, plucke vices vp by the rootes, and to plant vertues to amend the olde, and folow the good, reproue tyrauntes, and aſſiſt the poore: and when that we are gone from thence they that ſpake beſte wordes, are often taken with the worſt dedes. Oh wicked Rome, that now a daies hath ſuch ſenatours, which in ſayinge we wil doe, we wil doe, paſſe their life: and ſo euery man ſeking his owne profite, forgetteth the weale publyke. Oftentimes I am in the ſenate to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold others as they regard me: &amp; I maruaile much to heare the eloquence of their wordes, the zeale of iuſtice, and the iuſtification of their perſons: and after that I come thence, I am aſhamed to ſee their ſecret extortions, their damnable thoughtes, and their il workes. And yet ther is an other thing of more marueile, &amp; not to be ſuffered: that ſuch perſones as are moſt defamed, and vſe moſt wicked vices, with their moſt damnable incencio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, make their auowes to doe moſte extreame iuſtice. It is an infallible rule, and of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main malice moſt vſed: that he that is moſt hardy to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit greateſt crimes, is moſt cruel to geue ſentence againſt an other for the ſame offence.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:370"/>Me thinke that we beholde our owne faultes, as thorowe ſmall nettes, whiche cauſe thinges to ſeame the leſſer: but we behold the faultes of other in the water, that cauſeth them to ſeame greater. O how many haue I ſene condemned by the Senate, for one ſmall faulte done in all their life, and yet they them ſelues commit the ſame faulte euery houre. I haue red, that in the time of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, there was a renowmed pirate on the ſea, called <hi>Dionides,</hi> which robbed and drowned all ſhippes that he could get: and by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of this good king <hi>Alexander,</hi> there was an army ſent forth to take him. And when he was taken and preſented to <hi>Alexander,</hi> the king ſaide vnto him: ſhowe me <hi>Dionides,</hi> why doeſt thou ſpoyle on the ſea, that no ſhippe can ſayle out of the eaſt into the weſt for thee? The pirate aunſwered &amp; ſayd: if I ſpoyle the ſea, why doeſt thou <hi>Alexander</hi> robbe both the ſea and lande al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? O <hi>Alexander,</hi> becauſe I fight with one ſhip in the ſea, I am called a thefe: and becauſe thou robbeſt with two hundred ſhippes on the ſea, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt all the worlde with .200000. men, thou art called an Emperour.</p>
                     <p>I ſweare to thee <hi>Alexander,</hi> if fortune were as fauourable to me, and the gods as extreame againſt thee: they would geue me thine empire, and geue thee my litle ſhippe, and then peraduenture I ſhould be a better kinge then thou art, and thou a worſe thefe than I am. Theſe were high wordes, and wel receiued of <hi>Alexander:</hi> and of trouth to ſee if his wordes were correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to his promiſes, he made him of a pirate a great captaine of an army, &amp; he was more vertuous on land, than he was cruel on the ſea. I promyſe thee <hi>Catullus, Alexander</hi> did right wel therin, and <hi>Dionides</hi> was to be praiſed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for that he had ſaid. Now adaies in Italy, they that robbe openly, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led lordes: and they that rob priuely, are called theues. In the annales of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius</hi> I haue red, that in the ſecond troublous warre punike, betwene the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines &amp; <hi>Carthagians,</hi> there came an Embaſſadour <hi>Luſitain</hi> ſent from Spain, to treate of accorde of peace. When he came to Rome, he proued before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that ſithe he entred into Italy, he had bene ten tymes robbed of his goodes: and whiles he was at Rome, he had ſene one of them that robbed him, hange vp another that had defended him. He ſeing ſo euill a deede, and howe the thefe was ſaued without iuſtice: as a deſperate man tooke a cole, and wrote vpon the gibet as foloweth. O gibet, thou art planted among theues, noriſhed among theues, ſquared of theues, wrought of theues, made of theues, ſet among theues, &amp; hanged full of innocentes, with innocentes. The originall of theſe wordes are in the hiſtory of <hi>Liuius,</hi> where the whole <hi>Decade</hi> was written with black inke, and theſe wordes with red vermilion. I can not tel what other newes I ſhould ſende thee, but that euery thinge is ſo newe and ſo tender, and is ioyned with ſo euill ſement, that I feare me, all will fall ſodainly to the ground. I tell thee, that ſome are ſodainly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen within Rome vnto honour, whoſe fall I dare rather aſſure, then life. For al buildinges haſtely made, can not be ſure. The longer a tree is kept in his kinde, the longer it will be ere it be olde. The trees, whoſe fruite we eate in ſommer, do warme vs in wynter. O howe many haue we ſene wherof we haue marueyled of their riſing, and bene abaſhed of their falles. They haue growen as a whole piece, and ſodainly waſted as a ſkumme. Their felicitie hath bene but a ſhort moment, and their infortune as a long life.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:21411:370"/>Finally they haue made a mylle, and layde on the ſtones of encreaſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a litle grinding, left it vnoccupied all the whole yeare after. Thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt well my frende <hi>Catullus,</hi> that we haue ſene <hi>Cincius Fuluius</hi> in one yeare made conſul, and his children tribunes, his wyfe a matrone for young may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and beſide that, made keper of the capitol: and after that, not in one yere but the ſame daye we ſawe <hi>Cincius</hi> beheaded in the place, his children drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Tiber,</hi> his wife baniſhed fro Rome, his houſe raced down to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and all his goodes confiſked to the common treaſury. This rigorous exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we haue not red in any booke, to take a copy of it, but we haue ſeene it with our eies, to kepe it in our myndes. As the nations of people are varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo are the conditions of men diuers. And me thinketh this is true, ſeing that ſome loue, ſome hate, &amp; that ſome ſeke, ſome eſchewe: and that ſome ſette litle by, other make much ſtore. In ſuch wiſe, that al can not be content with one thing, nor ſome with al thinges can not be ſatiſfied. Let euery man choſe as him liſte, and embrace the world when he wyl, I had rather mount a ſoft pace to the falling, and if I can not come therto, I wyl abyde by the waye, rather then with the ſweate to mount haſtely, and then to tumble downe headlong. In this caſe ſithe mens hartes vnderſtande it, we nede not to wryte further with pennes. And of this matter marke not the litle that I doe ſay, but the great deale that I wyl ſay. And ſith I haue begon, and that thou art in ſtraunge landes, I wil write thee al the newes from hence. This yeare the .xxv. day of May, there came an Embaſſadour out of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſaiynge he was of the Iſle of <hi>Cetin,</hi> a baron right propre of body, ruddy of aſpect, and hardy of courage. He conſidered being at Rome, though the ſommers dayes were long, yet wynter would drawe on, and then would it be daungerous ſailyng into this Iſle, and ſawe that his buſines was not diſpatched: On a daie being at the gate of the ſenate, ſeing al the ſenatours entre into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol, without any armour vpon them, he as a man of good ſpirite, and zela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of his countrey, in the preſence of vs all, ſayde theſe wordes. O fathers conſcript. O happy people. I am come from a ſtraunge countrey to Rome, onely to ſee Rome: and I haue founde Rome, without Rome. The walles wherewith it is incloſed, hath not brought me hyther, but the fame of them that gouerne it. I am not come to ſee the treaſoury, wherein is the treaſure of all Realmes: but I am come to ſee the ſacred ſenate, out of the whiche iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth counſayle for all men. I came not to ſee ye, becauſe ye vanquiſhe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but becauſe I thought you more vertuous then all other. I dare well ſaye one thyng, except the Gods make me blynde, and trouble myne vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ye be not Romaines of Rome, nor this is not Rome of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines your predeceſſours. We haue heard in our Iſle, that diuers Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes haue bene wonne by the valiantnes of one, and conſerued by the wyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of all the Senate: and at this houre ye are more lyke to loſe, then to wynne as your fathers did. All their exercyſe was in goodnes, and ye that are their chyldren, paſſe all your tyme in ceremonies. I ſaye this, ye Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, becauſe ye haue almoſte killed me with laughing at you, to ſee how ye doe all as muche your diligence, to leaue your armure without the gate of the Senate, as your predeceſſours did take to them to defende the Empire. What profite is it to you, to leaue of theſe armours which hurte the bodies,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:371"/>
and to put on them thoſe which ſlea al the world: What profiteth it to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſuiter, that the ſenatour entreth vnarmed into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenate without ſweard or dagger: &amp; his hart entreth into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenate armed with malice? O Romains, I wil ye know, that in our yſle we eſteme you not as armed captaines, but as malicious ſenatours. You feare vs not with ſharpe grounden ſwoordes, and daggers, but with hard hartes &amp; venemous tongues. If ye ſhould in the ſenate put on harneis, &amp; therwith take away your liues, it were but a ſmall loſſe: ſeing that ye ſuſteine not the innocentes, nor diſpatche not the buſineſſe of ſuiters. I can not ſuffer it. I can not tell in what ſtate ye ſtande here at Rome: for in our iſle we take armoure from fooles, whether your armoures are taken away as from fooles or mad folkes, I wot not. If it be done for ambitiouſnes, it cometh not of Romaines, but of tyrauntes: that wranglers and ireful folke ſhould be iudges ouer the peacible, &amp; the ambicions ouer the meke, &amp; the malicious ouer the ſimple? If it be done becauſe ye be fooles, it is not in the lawes of the gods, that three hundred fooles ſhould gouerne three hundred thouſand wiſe men. It is a long ſeaſon that I haue taried for mine aunſwere and licence, &amp; by your delaies I am nowe farther of, then I was the firſt day. We bring oyle, hony, ſaffron, wood, and timber, ſalte, ſiluer. And ſold out of our yſle into Rome, &amp; ye wyl that we go els where to ſeke iuſtice. Ye wil haue one lawe to gather your rentes, and another to determine our iuſtice. Ye wyl that we pay our tributes in one day, &amp; ye wil not diſcharge one of our errandes in a whole yeare. I require you Romaines, determine your ſelues to take away our liues, and ſo we ſhall ende: or els heare our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes, to the entent that we may ſerue you. For in another maner it may be, that ye know by hearing with your eares, which peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture ye would not ſee with your eyes. And if ye thinke my wordes be out of meaſure, ſo that ye wyl remedy my countrey, I ſet not by my lyfe. And thus I make an ende. Verely frende <hi>Catullus,</hi> theſe be the woordes that he ſpake to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate which I gate in wryting. I ſay of trouth, that the hardineſſe that the Romaines were wont to haue in other countreis, the ſame (as now) ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gers haue in Rome. There were that ſaide that this Embaſſadour ſhould be puniſhed, but God forbid, that for ſayinge trouth in my preſence, he ſhoulde haue bene corrected. It is enough, &amp; to much to, to ſuffer theſe euils, though we ſlea not, and perſecute thoſe that aduertiſe and warne vs of them. The ſhepe are not in ſucrtie of the wolfe, but if the ſhepehearde haue his dogge with him. I meane, dogges ought not to leaue barkinge, for to awake the ſhepeherdes. There is no God commaundeth, nor lawe counſayleth, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth ſuffereth, that they whiche are committed to chaſtice lyers, ſhould hange them that ſaye trouthe. And ſithe the ſenatours ſhewe them ſelues men in their liuing, and ſometime more humaine than other that be Sclaues, who els ſhould deliuer theim from chaſticement? Oh Rome, and no Rome, hauing nothing but the name of Rome: where is nowe become the nobleneſſe of thy triumphes, the glory of thy children, the rectitude of thy iuſtice, and the honour of thy temples? For as now they chaſtice him more that murmureth againſt one only ſenatour, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei do them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> blaſpheme al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gods at once. For it greueth me more to ſe a ſenatour, or ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſore to be worſt of al other: than it diſpleaſeth me y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould be ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is the beſt of all other.
<pb facs="tcp:21411:371"/>
For of a trouth I ſaye to thee my frende <hi>Catullus,</hi> that as nowe we nede not to ſeke to the Gods in the temples, for the Senatours are made gods in our handes. There is difference betwene them that be immortall, and they that be mortall. For the Gods neuer doe thing that is euill, and the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours doe neuer any thinge well. The Gods neuer lye, and they neuer ſaye trouthe. The gods pardon often, and they neuer forgeue. The gods are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be honoured fiue times in the yeare, and the Senatours would be honoured ten times a daye. What wilt thou that I ſaye more? but what ſo euer the Gods doe, they ought to be prayſed: and the Senatours in all their workes deſerue to be reproued. Finally I conclude, that the Gods are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in euery thing, and erre and faile in nothing: and the Senatours aſſure nothing, but erre in all thing. Onely in one thing the Senatours are not of reaſon to be chaſticed, and that is: when they intende not to amende their faultes, they will not ſuffer the Oratours to waſt their time to ſhewe them the trouth. Be it as may be, I am of the opinion, that what man or woman withdraweth their eares from hearing of trouth, impoſſible it is for them to applie their hartes to loue any vertues: be it Cenſore that iudgeth, or Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natour that ordeineth, or Emperour that commaundeth, or Conſul that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth, or Oratour that preacheth. No mortall man, take he neuer ſo good heede to his workes, nor reaſon ſo well in his deſires, but that he deſerueth ſome chaſticement for ſome cauſe, or counſayle in his doinges. And ſithe I haue written to thee thus of others, I wyl ſomewhat ſpeake of my ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the words of thy letter I haue gathered, that thou deſireſt to know of my perſone. Knowe thou for certaine, that in the kalendes of Ianuary, I was made Cenſore in the ſenate, the which office I deſired not, nor I haue not deſerued it. The opinion of al wyſe men is, that no man, without he lack witte, or ſurmounteth in folly, wil gladly take on him the burdein &amp; charges of other men. A greater caſe it is, for a ſhamefaſt man to take on him an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to pleaſe euery man: for he muſt ſhewe a countenaunce outwarde, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that he thinketh inward. Thou wilt ſay, that the good are ordeined to take the charge of offices. O vnhappy Rome, that hath willed to take me in ſuch wyſe, as to be the beſt in it. Greuous peſtilence ought to come for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be good, ſithe I am ſcaped as good amonge the euill. I haue accepted this office, not for that I had nede thereof, but to fulfil the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of <hi>Antonius</hi> my graundfather. Haue no marueile of any thing that I do, but of that I leaue to be done. For euery man that is wedded to <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> there is no villany but he ſhall doe it. I ſweare to thee, that ſithe the daye we were wedded, me ſeameth that I haue no wit. I leaue wedding for this tyme, &amp; retourne to ſpeake of offices. Surely a peacible man ought to be in offices, though it be painfull: for as the offices are aſſured among them that be ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, ſo perillouſly goeth the vertuous folke among offices. And for the troth hereof, recken what they wynne, &amp; then thou ſhalt ſee what they looſe. Say that is good, if thou knoweſt it, &amp; heare the euil, if thou deſire to know it. He that wyl take the charge to gouerne other, ſeketh thought and trouble for him ſelfe, enuy for his neighbours, ſpurres for his enemies, pouertie for his rycheſſee, a waking of theues, perill for his body, ende of his dayes, &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his great renoume. Finally he ſeketh a waye to reiecte his frendes,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:372"/>
and a repeale to recouer his enemies. O an vnhappy man is he, that taketh on him the charge of children of many mothers, for he ſhal be alwayes char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with thoughtes how he ſhould content them all: full of ſighes, becauſe one hath to geue hym: feare that one ſhould take from him, weping if he leſe: and feare that they infame him. He that knoweth this, without long tariing ought to ſet a bridle in his head. But I ſaye of one, as I ſay of another. For I wyl ſweare, and thou wilt not deny it, that we may finde ſome nowe a daies, that had rather be in the parke to fight againſt the bulles, than be in ſuertie vpon the ſcaffold. Oftentimes I haue heard ſay: Go we to the <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> to renne at the Bulles: go we to chaſe the Hartes and wilde Bores: and when they come there, they renne away, not the beaſtes from them, but they from the beaſtes. In ſuch wiſe as they went running, they retourne agayne fleing. I ſaye, theſe ambicious perſones procure to gouerne, and are gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: they commaunde, and are commaunded, they rule, and are ruled: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally thinking to haue diuerſe vnder their handes, theſe wretches put them ſelues vnder euery mans foote. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remedy of al theſe perilles, my thought is comforted with one thing, and that is, without procuring or offering my ſelfe, the ſenate of their owne wyl hath commaunded me. In the .viii. table of our auncient lawes be theſe wordes. We commaunde that in our ſacred ſenate, charge of iuſtice be neuer geuen to him that willingly offreth him ſelf to it, but to ſuche as by great deliberation are choſen. This is certainly a iuſt lawe. For men now be not ſo vertuous, nor ſo louing to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, that they wil forget their own quietnes &amp; reſt, doing domage to them ſelfe, to procure another mans profite. There is none ſo foliſh that wil leaue his wife children, and his own ſwete countrey, to goe into ſtraunge countreis: but if he ſee him ſelfe among ſtraunge people, thinking vnder the colour of iuſtice to ſeke for his own vtilite. I ſay not this without weping: that the princes with their ſmal ſtudy and thought, and the iudges with their couetiſe, haue vndermined and ſhaken downe the high walles of the pollicy of Rome. O my frende <hi>Catullus,</hi> what wilt thou that I ſhould ſaye, but that our credence ſo miniſheth, our couetiſe ſo largely ſtretcheth, our hardines ſo boldeth, our ſhamefaſtnes ſo ſhameles, that we prouide for iudges to go &amp; rob our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as captaines againſt our enemies: I let thee to wit, wher as Rome was beloued for chaſtiſing the euil, now it is as much hated for ſpoyling the good. I do remember that I red, in the time of <hi>Dennis Siracuſan,</hi> that ruleth al <hi>Sicile,</hi> ther came an Embaſſadour fro <hi>Rhodes</hi> to Rome, being of a good age, wel learned, &amp; valiant in armes, &amp; right curious to note al thinges. He came to Rome to ſe the maieſty of the ſacret ſenate, the height of the high Capitol enuironned with the Colliſet: the multitude of ſenatours, the wiſedome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counſailours, the glory of triumphes, the correction of the euil, the peace of the inhabitauntes, the diuerſitie of nations, the aboudaunce of the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, the order of the offices: and finally ſeing that Rome was Rome, he was demaunded howe he thought thereby. He aunſwered and ſayed. O Rome, at this preſent worlde thou art full of vertues and wyſe men, hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou ſhalt be furniſhed with fooles. Loe what highe and very hyghe wordes were theſe. Rome was ſeuen hundred yeares without any houſe of fooles, and nowe it hathe bene three hundred yeares without one wyſe or
<pb facs="tcp:21411:372"/>
vertuous man. Loke what I ſay, it is no mockerie, but of trouth, if the piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Gods now a days did reiſe our predeceſſours from death to lyfe, either they would not know vs for their children, or els they would attached vs for fooles. Theſe be things vſed in Rome, but thou ſendeſt no word of that is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Agripine.</hi> I wil write nothing to the to put the to paine: write to me ſome thinge to reioyce me, if thy wife <hi>Diniſila</hi> chaunced wel of the flote that came out of <hi>Cetin</hi> with ſalt, oyle, and hony, I haue wel prouided for her. Wilt thou know that <hi>Flodius</hi> our vncle was caſt downe by the rage of his horſe, &amp; is deceaſſed. <hi>Laercia</hi> &amp; <hi>Colliodorus</hi> are frendes together, by occaſion of a mariage, I do ſend the a goune, I pray to the gods to ſend the ioy therof. My wife <hi>Fauſtine</hi> ſaluteth the. Recomend me to <hi>Iamiro</hi> thy ſon. The gods haue the in keping, and ſiniſter fortune be fro me.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:21411:373"/>
And if any honeſt lady wil take the demaunde of you it is a token that ſhe doth enuy the office that ye be of. For of trouth, that Lady which ſheweth her ſelfe annoyed with your paine openly, from henceforth I condemne her that ſhe hath ſome fault in ſecret. They that be on the ſtage, feare not the ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ring of the bul: they that be in the dongeon feare not the ſhot of the cannon. I wil ſay, the woman of good lyfe, feareth no mans ſlaunderous tongue The good matrons may kepe me for their perpetual ſeruaunt, and the euyl, for their chiefe enemy: I aunſwere. It is expedyent you know of what the firſt women were made. I ſay, that according to the aduerſities of nacions that are in the world, I find dyuers opinyons in this caſe. The <hi>Egiptians</hi> ſay, that when the riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> brake, and ouer ranne the earth, there abode cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine peces of earth whych cleued together, and the ſonne comyng to them, created many wild beaſtes, amongeſt whom was found the firſt woman, Note ladyes, it was neceſſarie that the floud <hi>Nilus</hi> ſhould breake out, ſo that the firſt woman myght be made of earthe. Al creatures are nouriſhed and bred in the intrayles of their mothers, except the woman, whych was bred without a mother. And it ſemeth moſt true, that without mothers ye were borne, for without rule ye lyue, and with order ye dye. Truly he taketh vpon him a great thing, and hath many cares in his mynde, muche to muſe vpon, neadeth much councel, neadeth long experience, &amp; ought to choſe amongeſt many women, that thinketh to rule one only wife by reaſon. Be the beaſtes neuer ſo wild, at length the Lyon is ruled by his keaper, the bul is encloſed in his parke, the horſe ruled by the brydel, the lytle hoke catcheth the fyſh, the Oxe contented to yealde to the yoke: only a woman is a beaſt whych wyll neuer be tamed, ſhe neuer loſeth her boldnes of commaundyng, nor by anye bridel wil be commaunded. The gods haue made men as men, and beaſtes as beaſts, &amp; mans vnderſtanding very high, and his ſtrength of great force: yet ther is nothing, be it of neuer ſo great power, that can eſcape a woman, eyther with ſleight or myght. But I ſay to you amorous ladyes, ther is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpurre can make you go, raine that can hold you backe, bridel that can refraine you, neither fiſhe hoke, ne net that can take you: to conclude, there is no law can ſubdue you: nor ſhame reſtraine you, nor feare abaſhe you, nor chaſtiſement amend you. O to what great peril putteth he himſſelfe vnto, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thinketh to rule and correct you. For if you take an opinyon, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole world cannot remoue you: who warneth you of any thing, ye neuer beleue him Yf they geue you good councel, you take it not: if one threaten you, ſtraite you complaine. If one pray you, then are ye proude: if they reioyce not in you, then are you ſpiteful. If one forbeare you, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ye bold: if one chaſtice you ſtraite you become ſerpents. Finally a woman wil neuer forget an iniurie, nor be thankeful for a benefite receiued. Now a days the moſt ſymplyſt of al women wil ſwere, that they know leſſe then they do: but I ſweare, whych of them that knoweth leaſt, knoweth more euil then al men, and of trouth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wiſeſt man ſhal faile in their wiſedom, Wil ye know my ladyes howe lytle you vnderſtand, &amp; how much you be ingnoraunt? that is, in matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaunce ye determine raſhly, as if ye had ſtudyed on it a thouſand yeres: if any reſiſte your councel, ye hold him for a mortal ennemy, hardy is that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that dare giue councel to a man, and he more bolde that taketh it of a
<pb facs="tcp:21411:373"/>
woman? but I retourne and ſaye, that he is a foole whych taketh it, and he more foole that aſketh it, but he moſt foole that fulfilleth it. My opinyon is, that he which wil not ſtomble amongeſt ſo hard ſtones, not pricke himſelfe amongeſt ſuch thornes, nor ſtyng him with ſo many nettels, let him harke what I wil ſay and do as he ſhal ſe, ſpeake wel, and worke euil. In promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing avow much: but in perfourmyng, accompliſhe litle. Finally allow your words, and condemne your counſels. Yf we could demaund of famous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which are dead, how they liked in their life the councel of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I am ſure they would not now riſe againe to beleue them, nor be reuiued to here them. How was king <hi>Philippe</hi> with <hi>Olimpia, Paris</hi> with <hi>Hellen: Alexander</hi> with <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fana, Aneas</hi> with <hi>Dido, Hercules</hi> with <hi>Deanyrya, Anibal</hi> with <hi>Tamira, Antony</hi> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                        <hi>Cleopatra, Iulius</hi> with <hi>Domitian, Nero</hi> with <hi>Agrippina:</hi> and if you wil not beleue what they ſuffered with them, aſke of me vnhappye man what I ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt you. O ye women, when I remember that I was borne of you, I loth my lyfe: and thinking how I liue with you. I wiſhe &amp; deſire my death. For ther is no ſuch death to tormente, as to haue to do with you: &amp; contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no ſuch lyfe, as to fly from you. It is a common ſaieng among women, that men be very vnthankeful, becauſe we were bred in your entrailes, We order you as ſeruauntes. Ye ſay for that ye brought vs forth with peril, and noriſhed vs with trauaile, it is reaſon that we ſhold alwayes employ vs to ſerue you I haue thought diuers tymes with my ſelfe, from whence the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that man hath to women cometh. Ther are no eyes but ought to wepe, nor hart but ſhould breake, nor ſpirite but ought to wayle, to ſe a wyſe man loſt by a fooliſh woman. The foolyſhe louer paſſeth the day to content hys eyes, and the darke night in tormenting himſelfe wyth ſond thoughtes, one day in hearing tydings, another day in doing ſeruyces, ſomtime liking dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſometime lothing lyght, being in company, and ſolitary lyueth: and final<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the poore louer may that he wil not, and would that he may not. More o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the counſel of his frends auayleth hym nothing, nor the infamy of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes, not the loſſe of goodes, the aduenture of honour, the loſynge of, his lyfe, nor the ſekyng of death, neyther commyng neare, nor flyeng farre, nor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his eyes, ne hearing with his eares, nor taſting with his mouth, nor fealing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his hand: &amp; to conclude, to get vyctory he is alway at warre wyth hym ſelfe. Then I would ye louers knewe, from whence your loue doth come, it is this. The entrayles wherof we are bread be fleſhe, the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes that we ſucked are fleſhe, the armes wherin we be faſtned be of fleſh, the thoughts which we thynke be fleſhly, the workes which we do are fleſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, the men with whom we lyue are of fleſh, and the wonder for whom we dye are fleſh: by whych occaſion commeth, the reuerting of our fleſh to fleſh, many fre harts are intangled with the ſnares of loue. It ſemeth wel my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ye were gendered in puddels as before is mencioned of the <hi>Egiptians:</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> puddels haue no cleare water to drincke, nor fruite to eate, nor fiſh to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor ſhyppe to ſayle in.</p>
                     <p>I meane, that in your lyues ye be filthy, your perſonnes wythout ſhame, in aduerſitye weake and feble, in proſperity ful of deceite and guyle, falſe in your woordes, and doubteful in your doynges, in hatynge without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in loue extreame, in gifts couetous, in takyng vnſhamefaſt: &amp; finally, I
<pb facs="tcp:21411:374"/>
ſay ye are the ground of feare, in whom the wiſe men find peril, &amp; the ſimple men ſuffer iniury. In you, the wiſe men hold their renowne ſlaundered, &amp; the ſimple men their lyfe in penury. Let vs omit the opinion of the <hi>Egiptians,</hi> and come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Grekes, which ſay, that in the deſertes of <hi>Arabia,</hi> the ſonne ſhineth hotteſt: &amp; at the beginning ther was found one woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with one bird called the <hi>Phenix,</hi> which bird was created on the water, and the woman engende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the great heat of the ſonne, &amp; of the pouder of trees in this wiſe. Ther was a tree ſore eaten w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wormes &amp; vpon a time a blaſt of lightning ſet it on fier &amp; burnt it, ſo as amongeſt the aſhes of that rotten tre, the firſt woman was made &amp; found. Although I be a Roman philoſopher, yet can I not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalow the opinion of the greke philoſopher. Of trouth ye amorous dames, ye haue your tongues of the nature of fire, and your condicions like the pouder of a rotten tre. Accordyng to the dyuerſity of beaſts, ſo nature hath in diuers parts of the body placed their ſtrength: as the Eagle in her byl, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Vnicorne in the horne, the ſerpent in the taile, the bul in the head, the beare in his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, the horſe in the breaſt, the dogge in the teath, the bore in the tuſke, the doues in the winges, &amp; the women in their tongues. For of trouth the flight of the doue is not ſo hyghe, as the fantaſy of your folyſhnes is vaine: the cat ſcratcheth not ſo ſore with her nayles, as ye ſcratch the foliſh men with your importunities. The dogge hurteth not hym ſo much that he runneth after, as ye do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſorowful louer that ſerueth you: the life of him is not in ſo muche daunger that catcheth the bul by the hornes, as the ſame of him that falleth in your hands. To conclude, the ſerpent hath not ſo much poiſon in his taile: as ye haue in your tongues. I accept the Romaine ladies a part, for ther are many very noble, whoſe lyues are not touched with complaint, nor good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes had in ſuſpect. Of ſuch, neither my letter ſpeaketh ought, nor my penne writeth: but of thoſe women I ſpeake that be ſuch, as al the venemous bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world haue not ſo much poiſon in their bodyes, as one of thoſe hath in their tongues. And ſith the gods haue commaunded, &amp; our fate doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the life of men cannot paſſe without women: I aduiſe the youth, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſech the aged, I wake the wiſe, &amp; inſtruc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ng the auncient lawes of <hi>Plato,</hi> I find written this. We comaund that al women openly defamed, bee openlye baniſhed the citye, to thintente that others ſeing the ſinne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, may abhorre the ſame, for feare to fal in the like paine. The ſame law ſaid further, we comaund y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they pardon a woman for al her faults ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth bodely, in caſe ye ſe amendment likewiſe in her: but we wil that no fault be pardoned, committed by the tongue. For actual ſinne done, is the frailety of nature, the tongue, only of malyce. O deuyne <hi>Plato,</hi> maiſter &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of al knowledge &amp; ſcience, &amp; prince of al philoſophers. When thou in the golden world maydſt ſuch lawes, in whiche time ther was ſuch ſcarſitye of thoſe women which were euil, and ſo great plenty of them that were good: what ſhould we do now in Rome, wher there be ſo many euil openlye, and none good in ſecret? women naturally oughte to be ſhamefaſt in their face, temperate in wordes, wiſe of wit, ſober in going, honeſt in conuerſacion, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in correction, ware in their lyuyng, auoyding companyes, faithfull in their promyſe, conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in loue. Fynally ſhe that wilbe counted honeſt, let her

not truſt to the wiſedome of the wiſe, nor commit her fame to the wanton youth: let euery wiſe woman take hede what he is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> promyſeth her ought. For after that the flames of Venus be ſet on fire, and Cupide ſhotte his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, the rich offereth all that he hath, and the poore al that he may. The wiſe man wil euer be her frend, and the ſimple man for euer her ſeruaunt. The wiſe man wil loſe his lyfe for her, and the ſimple wil accept his death for her. The old men ſay, they wilbe frendes to their frendes: and the yonge man wil ſay, he wilbe enemy to their enemyes. The aged promyſing to pay her debtes, the other to reuenge her iniuries. Finally the one becauſe to hide their pouertie, and the other to publyſhe their beautie, leade theſe fooles lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their lyues, &amp; bringinge their fame to ende. I wil leaue to ſpeake of the good women, for I mind not to charge them with ought. I aſke you amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ladyes yf <hi>Plato</hi> was amongeſt you when ye made a play of my lyfe, &amp; drew my picture about Rome? no ſurely, for that I ſe in your act now, I do ſuſpect that to be true which hath bene ſayd of others, for there are fewe in Rome that execute the paine of <hi>Platoes</hi> law. One thing ye cannot deny, if I were the worſt of al men, at the laſt ye ſe the end of my vylanies: but this you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not deny, that ſhe which is leaſt euil of al you, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> naughtines of her life, I could not ſufficiently ſet out in my lyfe.

                     <p>
                        <hi>MArcus</hi> the Romaine pretor, being in the warres of <hi>Dacia:</hi> ſendeth health to his louing <hi>Boemia,</hi> remainyng in the pleaſours of Rome. Eſcapinge from a cruel battaile thy few lynes I red, and vnderſtode thy large in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formacion. I let the know thou haſt aſtonyed me more, then mine enemyes haue feared me: and taking thy letter in my hands, the herbe of malyce en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into my hart. When I temper my body with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> delights, I thinke my hart fre fro the venyme of thy amours: ſith I of my wil, and thou for want of power haue geuen vs to be fre of our pleaſures, I thinke as wel to make a deuorce of our ſorowes. But ye be ſuch, ye ſuch I ſay, as are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baniſhmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of loue: &amp; the treaſour of grefes. The loue of you al ought to be digeſted with pilles, but the paſſion of one of you wil not be oppreſſed, with all the rubarbe, in <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Ye ſhew your ſelues cruel to pardon an enemy: and euer lyghtly you chaunge your frends. I haue curiouſly made ſerche, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt delight gouerned my youth: yet could I neuer ſe in a woman ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, nor reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their loue, nor end in their hate. The preſent wantones qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relleth with my youth paſſed, becauſe thou ſeeſt not in me the auncient good wil toward the, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preſent ſeruyce. And certainly hearing thy accuſacion, &amp; not my iuſtificacion: thou myghteſt pay me as iuſtly with death, as I pay the with forgetfulnes. The whych forgetfulnes ought to be as ſtraunge in him that ſerueth as vngratitude in the lady that is ſerued. Thinkeſt thou y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue forgotten the lawe of Venus? when I commaunded that the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous louers ſhould exerciſe their ſtrength in chiualry, and occupy their harts in loue? &amp; more it willeth a man to weare his geare cleanly, their feete right, their bodies conſtant, their voice ſoft &amp; humble, demure &amp; modeſte of there: they ought to haue eyes open alwayes loking vp to the wyndowes, &amp; their harts ready to fly into the ayer. For a trouth my frend <hi>Boemia,</hi> he is a groſe lo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer that hath his wil in captiuity: and his iudgment fre. The iudgement is of no value, where the wil is in thraldome. This I ſay, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou maieſt know, though my age hath left the exerciſe: yet my vnderſtandyng hath not forget the art, Thou complaineſt becauſe I geue my ſelfe to much quiet, and that I haue forgotten the, I wil not deny the truth, the day of my forgetting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the pryuy of my thoughtes. And reaſon the ouerſeer declareth, that it is not requyſite for my grauytie to permyt I ſhould loue: nor in thy age to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to be beloued. The world doth diſſemble many things in youth: whych in age meriteth greuous corrections. The wanton toyes of youth procede of ignoraunce, but the vylanies done in age grow of malyce.</p>

gaſed to the wyndowes, I plaied on the gittornes: I ſcaled the walles, I wakened y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> youth. Thinkeſt thou I wiſte what I did in my youth? but ſith I ſe my ſelfe bereued of all my wonted wanton toyes, and poliſhed with ſo many whyte heares, clad with ſo many ſorowes: either I thinke nowe I was not then, or els I dreame nowe, not knowing the way I ſtraye in, nor ſeing that ſtony way ready to ſtumble in. Vnwittingly I haue fallen into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtaires, not foreſeing the wherilpole: guidles I entred, in the raſhenes of my youth I loſt me: for the which I aſke pardon. And now that I am out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> briers, thou wouldeſt haue me further in then euer I was. Now that I can not take the purgations, thou offereſt to me the ſiroppes. I haue waked all night, and now thou geueſt me a freſh alarum. By our auncient frendſhip I pray thee, &amp; by the gods I coniure thee: that ſithens my harte is rebell to thy wyl, that thy doubtfull wil doe ſuffer, and let alone, my wyll out of doubte. And becauſe thou ſhouldeſt not thinke any vngratitude in my white heeres as I may in thy young wanton perſone, I will that we accompte that we haue gotten, &amp; that we hope to get.

Suche be ye, and others. Thou writeſt in thy letter howe thou wouldeſt willingly leue Rome, and come to ſee me in the warres of <hi>Dacia.</hi> Conſidering thy folly I laugh, but knowing thy boldnes I beleue thee. And when I thinke on this, I tourne to my boſome, &amp; peruſe thy ſeale: doubting whether the letter were thyne or not. The vaynes of my hart do chaunge, my colour doeth tourne, imagening that either ſhame hath vtterly forſaken thee, or els grauitie hath wholy abandoned me: for ſuch lightnes ſhould not be beleued, but of the like perſons. Thou knoweſt wel he that doth euil, deſerueth puniſhment ſoner, then he that doth infamy. I would aſke the whether thou wilt go? thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fredeſt to be cut as ſower grape, &amp; now thou woldeſt be ſold for good wine? thou cameſt in with cheries, &amp; yet wouldeſt remain as quinces. We haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the in bloſſomes, &amp; thou wilt be like the fruite? the nuttes be pleaſaunt, but the ſhelles be hard. By dong thou were made ripe in thy youthe, &amp; thou weneſt to be in ſtil. Thou art nought els but rotten. And if thou be rotten, y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> art to be abhorred. Thou art not content with .xl. yeres which y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt, wherof xxv. thou dideſt paſſe in taſt, like to ſwere wine that is ſold, or like the melo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that be rype &amp; melow. Art not thou that <hi>Boemia</hi> which lacketh two teethe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? are not thine eies ſonken into thy head? thy heares whiter, thy fleaſhe wryncled, &amp; thy hand periſhed with the gout, &amp; one ribbee marred with child bearing? Whether doeſt thou deſire to go? put thy ſelfe then in a barel, &amp; caſt it into the ryuer, ſo ſhalt thou become pure &amp; white. We haue eaten the freſh fiſh, &amp; now thou wouldeſt bring hether the ſtinking ſalt fiſhe. O <hi>Boemia, Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> in this caſe I ſee no truſt in youthe, nor hope in age. For vnder this thy hored age there is hid, the panges of fraile youth. Thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineſt that thou haſt nothing, it is an olde quarell of the auncient amorous ladies in Rome that taking all thinges, they ſay they haue left them nothing. The cauſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, where you doe lacke credite, there ye would haue it accompliſhed with money.

Of trauel &amp; pouertie thou complaineſt. I am he that hath great nede of the medicine for this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, &amp; plaiſters for the ſonne, &amp; cold water for ſuch a burning feuer. Doeſt thou not wel remember, how I did baniſh my neceſſitie into the land of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulnes, &amp; placed thy good wil, for the requeſt of my ſeruice? in the winter I went naked, &amp; in the ſommer loded with clothes. In the mire I went on foote, &amp; rode in a faire way. When I was ſad I laught, when I was glad I wept. Being afraid, I drew out my ſtrength, &amp; out of ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth cowardnes. The night with ſighes, &amp; daies in wayling I conſumed. When thou hadeſt nede of any thing, I robbed my father for it. Tel me <hi>Boemia,</hi> with whom did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou fulfil thine open follies, but with the miſorders that I did in ſecret? wote ye what I thinke of the amorous ladies in Rome? that ye be mootes in olde garmentes, a paſtime for light perſones, a treaſure of fooles, &amp; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcres of vices. This that ſemeth to me is, that in thy youth euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gaue to thee, for that thou ſhouldeſt geue to euery one: nowe thou geueſt thy ſelfe to euery man, becauſe euery one ſhould geue them to thee.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deuide them to their fathers, &amp; euery one ſhalbe wel prouided. <hi>Lucia</hi> thy doughter in dede, &amp; mine by ſuſpect, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre that I haue done more in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieng of her, then thou diddeſt, bringing her forth. For in the getting of her, thou calleſt many: but to mary her, I did it alone. Very litle I wryte to the, in reſpect of that I would wryte. <hi>Butrio Cornely</hi> hath ſpoken much to me on thy behalf, &amp; he ſhall ſay as much to the in my part.

                     <p>It is a common thing to them that be ſlouthfull to ſpeake of loue, for fooles to treat of bookes, &amp; for cowards to blaſe of armes.

O malicious Marke, if thou wert as valiaunte, as thou art ſpiteful: thou ſhouldeſt be no leſſe feared among the barbarous nacions, then thou art ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred (with good reaſon) amongeſt the Romaines. Tel me what thou liſt, but thou canſt not deny? but both thou haſt bene, &amp; arte a ſlacke louer, a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly knight, an vnknowen frend, auaricious, infamed, an ennemy to all men: &amp; frend to none. Moreouer we y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knew the a lyght yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, condemne the now for an old doting foole. Thou ſaieſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> taking my letter into thy han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, forthwith thy hart receiued the hearbe of malyce. I beleue the wel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworne: for any thing touching malyce, doth ſtreight find harber in thy breſt. The beaſts corrupted do take poiſon, which the ſound, &amp; of good complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, refuſeth. Of one thing I am ſure, thou ſhalt not die of poiſon. For ſeldom times one poiſon hurteth another: but it driueth out the other. O malicious Marke: if al they in Rome knew the, as wel as the vnhappie <hi>Boemia</hi> dothe: they ſhould ſe how much the words that thou ſpeakeſt, differ from the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of thy hart. And as by the bookes thou makeſt, thou meriteſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of a philoſopher: euen ſo for the ilnes thou inuenteſt, thou doſt deſerue the name of a tiraunt. Thou ſaiſt, thou ſaweſt neuer conſtancy in a womans loue, nor end in her hate. I ioy not a litle, that other ladies in Rome as wel as I, doo know thy ſmal wiſedom. Behold Marke, I wil not mocke the: For thou art ſuch a one, as neuer deſerued that one ſhold begin to loue, nor end to hate Wilt thou haue ſtabilite in loue, and thou vnthankeful of thy ſeruyce? wilte thou ſerue in mockerie, and be beloued faithfully? wilt thou enioy the parſon, without ſpending any of the goods? wilt thou haue no complaints on the, &amp; thou ceaſeſt not thy malice? Thou knoweſt the il of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I wil thou know that we be not ſo foliſhe as ye wene vs: nor thou ſo wiſe as thou praiſeſt thy ſelfe to be. Hitherto we haue ſene mo men folow the deſire of women, then women haue liked to folow men. I haue ſene a thouſand times, yea &amp; thou thy ſelfe, that one man hath not ſo mighty a hart, as to ouercome three wiſe wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; one woman holdeth her ſelfe ſtrong inough, to ſubdue .iii.

Great is the loue of the countrey, and many leaue much goodes which they haue in ſtraunge landes, to lyue poorely in their owne: but greater is thy loue, ſith I would leaue Rome with the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes therin, &amp; come to ſeke the in ſtraung lands amonge the rude ſouldiours. O malicious Marke, O ſtraunge frend. If I leaue Rome, it were to goe
<pb facs="tcp:21411:377"/>
ſeke my harte, whiche is with thee in the warres. And certainly oftentimes when I thinke, of thy abſence, I fall into a ſwoune, as one that hadde no harte: but I neuer fynde remedy. I thinke oure loue is not like to theſe beaſtes, whiche haue their myndes only vpon ſenſual pleaſures, without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ioyning of the louing hartes. I ſweare to the by the goddeſſe Veſtal, &amp; the mother <hi>Berecinthia:</hi> that thou oweſt more to me for the loue I haue borne to thee in one day, then for the ſeruice I haue done to thee in .xxii. yeres. Behold vnhappy <hi>Marke,</hi> howe much and dearly I loued thee. In thy preſence I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes behelde thee, and abſent I alwayes thought of thee: ſleping I drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med on thee, I haue wepte for thy ſorowes, and laught at thy pleaſures: and finally al my wealth I wiſhed thee, and al thy miſfortunes I toke as mine. I enſure thee of one thing: that I fele not ſo much the perſecution thou haſt done to me, as I doe the wayling forgetfulnes thou ſheweſt to me. It is a great griefe to a couetous man to loſe his goodes: but without compariſon it is a greater torment for the louer, to ſee his loue euill beſtowed. It is a hurt that is alwayes ſore, and a payne alwayes paynefull, a ſorowe always ſorowfull, and it is a death that neuer endeth. O if men knewe howe dearly and faithfully women doe loue, when they are bent to loue: and with what malicious harte they hate, being ſet to hate: I ſweare to you, ye would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer company with them in loue: or if ye did loue them, ye would neuer leaue for feare of their hate. And as there is neuer great hate, but where there was firſt much loue: euen ſo thou ſhalt neuer be greatly hated, for that thou wert neuer truly beloued of the ladies. The ſorowful <hi>Boeme</hi> hath loued thee xxii. yeares of her life: and nowe ſhe onely hateth thee till after her deathe.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſayſt I may be eaten for veriuyce: and yet would be ſolde for wyne. I knowe I haue erred, as one both young and light: and when I founde me to ſtraye out of the waye I was to farre gone, and my miſhappe coulde no other way, nor remedy. It is a great loſſe of all loſſes when there is no remedy. I haue offended as a weake and frayle woman, but thou as a man ſtrong. I erred by ſimple ignoraunce, but thou of a purpoſed and wilful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. I ſinned not, knowyng that I did amiſſe: but thou kneweſt what thou diddeſt. I did credite thy wordes as a faithfull knighte: and thou betraideſt me with a .1000. lyes, as a common lier. Tell me, diddeſt not thou ſeke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to come into my mothers houſe <hi>Getulia,</hi> to entiſe me her doughter <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> to thy mynde? diddeſt not thou promiſe my father, to teache me to reade in one yeare: and readeſt me <hi>Ouide</hi> of the act of loue? dideſt not thou ſweare to mary me, and after withdrewe thy hande as a falſe adulterer? doeſt thou not knowe that thou neuer foundeſt in my perſone any vyllany, nor in thy mouthe any truthe? At the leaſt thou canſt not deny, but thou haſt offended the gods, thou art defamed amongeſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, odious to the Romains, a ſclaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of the good folkes, an example to the ill, and finally a traitour to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a breaker of thy faith to my mother, and to me the vnhappy <hi>Boemia</hi> an vnkynde louer. O malicious <hi>Marke,</hi> haſt thou not cut me in leaues, offering to my father to kepe his vines ſafe? Euell may the chicken truſte the Kyte, or the Lambes the Wolfe, or the Doues the Faucon, but thou arte worſe to bring vp the doughters of good men. O curſed <hi>Marke,</hi> a hurtfull keaper of vines hath the Matrone of Rome founde thee, in keapyng their doughters. I ſweare, that there was neyther grape nor cluſter, but it was either eaten,
<pb facs="tcp:21411:377"/>
or gathered by the. Thou diddeſt eate me grene, for the which I promiſe the it hath ſet thy teeth on edge. Thou ſayeſt I was riped by power of heat and ſtraw. It greueth me not ſo much that thou ſaieſt it, as that thou geueſt me occaſion to ſay to the, thy ſhame is ſo ſhameleſſe, and thy euil ſo malicious, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I cannot make aunſwere to thy purpoſe, onleſſe I rubbe the on the quycke. I aſke the when thou mariedſt <hi>Fauſtine:</hi> whether thou foundeſt them grene or ripe? thou knoweſt wel, and ſo do I alſo, that other gaged the veſſel, and thou drankeſt the lyees: other had the meate, and thou the huſkes: other did eate them being grene, and with the refuge ſet thy teath on edge. O curſed <hi>Marke:</hi> behold how great thy euels are, and how the goddes haue iuſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the, that beinge yonge, thou couldeſt not deſerue to be beloued of thy louers, nor yet now in thy age, thy wife kepe her faith to the. For me to be reuenged of thy parſon, I nede no more but to ſe the maried to <hi>Fauſtine.</hi> By the mother <hi>Berecinthia</hi> I promiſe the, that if thy ſmal wiſedome mighte at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to know at the ful, what they ſay of the, and her in Rome: thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt wepe both day and night for the life of <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> and not leaue the woful <hi>Boemia.</hi> O <hi>Marke,</hi> litle care is taken for the, and how farre is our vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vncoupled from thy thoughtes. For through thy great learninge, thy houſe in the day tyme is a ſchole of philoſophers, and the wantonnes of thy wife <hi>Fauſtine</hi> in the night maketh it a receite of ruffians. It is a iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the goddes, ſith that thy malice onely ſufficeth to poiſon many that be good, the euilnes onely of one woman, ſhalbe enough to ſpoile, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thy good renowm. One difference ther is betwene the and me, and thy <hi>Fauſtine,</hi> which is, that my facts are in ſuſpect, and yours done in deed, mine be in ſecret, but yours knowen openly. I haue but ſtombled, but you haue fal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>len. For one onely fault I deſerue puniſhment: but you deſerue pardon for none. My diſhonour dyed with my fact, and is buried with my amendme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: but your infamy is borne with your deſires, nouriſhed with your malices, &amp; ſtil with your works. Finally your infamy ſhal neuer dye, for you liued neuer wel. O <hi>Marke</hi> malicious, with al that thou knoweſt, doſt not thou knowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to dye wel, doth couer an euil fame, and to make an end of an euyl life, doth begin a good fame? Thou ceaſeſt not to ſay euil onely of ſuſpect, which thy falſe iudgements geueth: and yet wouldeſt thou we ſhold conceale that, we ſe with our eyes? Of one thing I am ſure, that neyther of the, nor of <hi>Fauſtine</hi> ther are hath bene any falſe witnes. For ther are ſo many true euilles, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther neadeth no lyes to be inuented. Thou ſaieſt it is an old cuſtome, with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous ladies in Rome, though they take of many, yet they are the poreſt of al: becauſe we want credite, we are honored for ſiluer. It is moſt certaine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of holly we loke for pricks, of acorns huſkes, of nettels ſtinginge, and of thy mouth malices. I haue ſeriouſly noted: I neuer heard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſay wel of any, nor I neuer knew any that would the good. What greater puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t can I deſire for thy wickednes, nor more vengeaunce for my iniuries, then to ſe al the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous ladies of Rome diſcontented with thy life, and ioy to thinke on thy death, curſed is the man whoſe life many do bewaile, and in whoſe death e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one doth reioyce. It is the propertie of ſuch vnthankeful wretches as thou art, to forget the great good done to them, &amp; to repent y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> litle they geue. How muche the noble harts do reioyce in geuing to other: ſo much they are aſhamed to take ſeruice vnrewarded. For in geuing they are lords, &amp; in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:21411:378"/>
they become ſclaues. I aſke what it is thou haſt geuen me, or what y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haſt receiued of me? I haue aduentured my good fame, and geuen thee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of my perſone: I haue made thee lord of me and mine: I baniſhed me from my countrey, I haue put in perill my life. In recompence of this, thou doſt detect me of miſery. Thou neuer gaueſt me ought with thy harte, nor I toke it with good will, nor it euer did me profite. As all thinges recouer a name, not for the worke we openly ſee: but for the ſecrete intention with which we worke. Euen ſo thou vnhappy man deſireſt me, not to enioye my parſonne, but rather to haue my money. We ought not to call thee a cleare louer, but rather a thefe, &amp; a wily perſone. I had a litle ring of thine, I minde to throwe it into the riuer: &amp; a gowne thou gaueſt me, which I haue burnt. And if I thought my body were increaſed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bread I did eate of thine, I would cut my fleſhe being whole, &amp; let out my bloud without feare. O malicious <hi>Marke,</hi> thy obſcured malice wyl not ſuffer thee to vnderſtande my cleare letter. For I ſent not to thee to aſke money, to relieue my pouertie and ſolitarines: but only to acknowledge &amp; ſatiſfie my willing hart. Such vayne &amp; couetous men as thou, are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with giftes, but the hartes incarnate in loue, are not ſatiſfied with a litle money. For loue is rewarded alway with loue. The man that loueth not as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of reaſon, but like a brute beaſt, &amp; the woman that loueth not where ſhe is beloued, but onely for the gaine of her body: ſuch ought not to be credited in wordes, nor their perſones to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored. For the loue of her endes when goods faileth: and his loue when her beautie decaieth. If the beautie of my face did procure thy loue, &amp; they riches only allured my good wyl: it is right, that we ſhould not be called wyſe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, but rather foliſhe perſons. O curſed <hi>Marke,</hi> I neuer loued thee for thy goodes, although thou likedſt me for that I was faire. Then I loued with my hart, &amp; now I abhorre thee with all my hart. Thou ſaieſt the gods vſed great pitie on me, to geue me fewe children, &amp; them many fathers. The grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teſt faulte in women is ſhameles, &amp; the greateſt villany in men is to be euill ſayers. Diuers thinges ought to be borne in the weakenes of women, which in the wiſedome of men are not permitted. I ſay this, for that I neuer ſaw in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perance to cloke thine own maliciouſnes, nor wiſedome to ſhadow the debilitie of others. Thou ſaieſt my children haue many fathers: but I ſweare to thee, that the children of <hi>Fauſtine</hi> ſhal not be fatherles, although y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> die. And if the gods as thou ſaieſt haue ben pitifull to my childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no leſſe art thou to ſtraunge children. For <hi>Fauſtine</hi> kepeth the but to excuſe her faultes, &amp; to be tutor to her children. O curſed <hi>Marke,</hi> thou nedeſt not take thought, for thy children haue no nede to be maried. For one thing we are bound to thee, that is: the example of thy pacience, for ſince thou ſuffreſt <hi>Fauſtine</hi> in ſo many open infamies, it is no great nede we ſuffer any ſecretes in thee. For this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I ſay no more, I end my letter, deſiring to ſe ſhortly the ende of thy life.</p>

And not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiringe thy perſon, I had not put thy fame in ſo greate peril, nor my life in doubt: nor we had geuen no occaſion to Rome to ſpeake of vs. For of troth lady <hi>Macrine,</hi> in this caſe I condemne my ſelfe. For willyngly I dyd behold the. I did not ſalute the, althoughe thou deſiredſt to be ſene. Sith thou were ſet vp as a white, it is no merueile though I ſhotte with the arrowes of my eyes, at the but of thy beauty, with rollyng eyes, with browes bent, wel co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured face, incarnate teth, ruddy lipps, courled heere, hands ſet with ringes, clothed with a thouſand maner of coloures, hauyng purſes full of ſwete ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoures, the bracelettes and earinges ful of pearles and ſtones. Tel me what this meaneth? The moſt that I can thinke of this is, ſith you ſhew vs your bodies openly, ye would we ſhould know your deſires in ſecret. And if it be ſo, as I beleue it is, it ſemeth to me lady <hi>Macrine,</hi> thou oughteſte to loue him that lyketh the, to enfourme him that ſeketh the, to aunſwere him that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the, to feale him that fealeth the, and to vnderſtand him that vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the: and ſith thou vnderſtandeſt me, I do vnderſtand the, &amp; vnderſtand that thou knoweſt not.

O cruel <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crine,</hi> I know not what iuſtice this is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they kil men for robbing &amp; ſtealing of money, &amp; ſuffer women to liue, which ſteale mens harts. If they take the liues from them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> picke purſes, why then do they ſuffer ladies which robbe our entrailes? By thy noblenes I pray the, &amp; by the goddeſſe <hi>Venus</hi> I coniure the, eyther ſatiſfye my deſire, or reſtore to me my hart whych thou haſt rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed from me. I would thou knew lady <hi>Macrine,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clere intencion of my hart, rather then this letter written with my hande. If my hap were ſo good, as thy loue would permit me to ſpeake with the, I wold hope by ſight &amp; ſpeche to win that, which I am in ſuſpect by my letter to loſe. The reaſon wherof is, becauſe thou ſhalt rede my rude reaſons in this leter, &amp; if y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> ſaweſt me, thou ſhouldeſt ſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bitter teares which I would offer to thee, in this my vnhappy life.

And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſt of al is, if others do ſhew the of my grefes, thou takeſt it as a mockerie. O y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I had ſo much knowledge wher to complaine to the, as thou haſt power to ceaſe my plaint: then my wiſedom ſhould be no leſſe praiſed among the wiſe, then thy beauty amongeſt the foles. I beſech the hartely not to haue reſpect to the rudenes of my reaſons, but regard y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of my teares, which I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as a witnes of my wil. I know not what profite may come by my harme, nor what gaine of my loſſe thou maiſt hope to haue, nor what ſurety of my peril thou maiſt attaine, nor what pleaſure of my paine thou maiſte haue. I had aunſwere by my meſſenger, that without reading my letters, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy owne hands thou didſt rent them in pieces, it ought to ſuffice to thinke how many parſons is tormented. If it had pleaſed you lady <hi>Macrine</hi> to haue red thoſe few lines, you ſhould haue perceiued how I am inwardly tormen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted Ye women be very extreme, &amp; for the miſaduenture of one man, a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wil complaine of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in general, So ye al ſhew cruelty for one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer cauſe, openly ye pardon all mens liues, and ſecretly ye procure death to al.

One thing I would thou ſholdeſt remember, and not forget, that is.

die, as thou by me doeſt liue. In this peruers opinion abide not, ſo mayeſt thou haſarde the life of vs both. Thou hurteſt thy good name, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt my health, in the ende thou muſt come to the ſame phiſicke. Pardone me lady <hi>Macrine,</hi> if I ſaye ought that may offende thee. I know ye women de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire one thing greatly, that is, to haue ſoueraintie of vs, and yet not ſeame ſo much as by thought to wyſhe the ſame. Thou haddeſt the ſame of a gentle nature, though in dede thou were not ſo: yet thou haddeſt the ſame thereof, and an auncient good name ought not to be loſte with a newe vnkindenes. Thou knoweſt howe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary ingratitude is, to vertue in a vertuous houſe. Thou canſt not be called vertuous, but if thou be curteous. There is no greater ingratitude, then not to loue againe. Though I viſite the, and thou not me, it is nothing: though I remember thee, and thou forgetteſt me, it is nothing: though I wepe, and thou laugh, it is nothing: though I craue of thee, and thou denie me, it is nothing: though thou oweſt me, and paye me not, it is nothing. But if I loue thee, and thou not me, this is a great thing: which the eies can neither diſſimule, nor the hart ſuffre. All the vices in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men are to be pardoned, becauſe they offende naturally: ſaue onely this diſcourteſy in women, and vngentlenes in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which are counted of malice. Diuerſe ſeruices by me done to thee, and all the good willes I haue hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore borne to thee, thou onely lady <hi>Macrine</hi> with one thing rewarde me. I praye thee be not ſlacke to helpe me, for I was not ſo to offer me into peril. If thou ſayeſt that <hi>Patroclus</hi> thy huſbande hath the propertie in thee, at the leaſt yet receiue me vpon proufe, and I will pretende a poſſeſſion of thee: and in this wyſe the vayne glorie in being thyne, ſhall hyde the hurt being myne. thou makeſt me maruayle not a litle, that for ſo ſmall a rewarde, thou wilt ſuffer ſo great an importunitie. For certainly we graunte many thynges to an importunate man, whiche we deny to a temperate man. If thou lady <hi>Macrine</hi> hopeſt to ouercome me: beholde I yelde me as vanquiſhed. If thou wilt loſe me, I holde me loſte: if thou wylt kyll me, I holde me dead.</p>
                     <p>For by the geſtures whiche I make before thy gate, and the ſecreate ſighes whiche I fetche in my houſe, thou mayeſt knowe howe greatly I mynde to reſte: but thy braue aſſaultes, are rather buyldinges to nouryſhe death, then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forte the lyfe. If thou wylt I eſcape this daunger, deny me not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. For it ſhalbe a greater diſhonour for to ſlea me, then ſhame to ſaue me. It is no iuſt thing for ſo ſmall againe, to loſe ſo faithfull a frende. I wote not howe to make thee my detter, nor howe to make thee paye me, and the worſte of all is, I knowe not what to ſaye, nor howe to determine. For I was not borne to myne owne wealth, but to be faithful in thy ſeruices. And ſythe thou knoweſt whom thou haſte truſted with thy meſſage, the ſame I doe truſt with this open letter, and my aunſwere in ſecrete.

                        <hi>MArke</hi> full of ſorowe, to thee careles <hi>Lyuia.</hi> If thy litle care did lodge in me, and my ſorowes were harboured in thee, thou ſhouldeſt then ſee howe litle the quarell is that I make to thee, in reſpect to the torment I ſuffer. If the flambes iſſued out, as the fire doth burne me within, the hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uens ſhould periſhe with ſmoke, and the earth ſhould make imbers. If thou doeſt well remember, the firſte time I ſaw thee in the temple of the virgin Veſtals, thou being there diddeſt alwayes praye to the gods for thy ſelfe, and I vpon my knees prayed to thee for me. Thou knoweſt, and ſo doe I, that thou diddeſt offer oyle and hony to the goddes, but I did offer to thee teares and ſighes. It is iuſt thou geue more to hym that offered his harte, then to him whiche draweth money out of his purſe. I haue determined to wryte to thee this letter, whereby thou maieſte perceiue howe thou arte ſerued with the arrowes of my eyes, whiche were ſhott at the white of thy ſeruice, O vnhappy that I am, I feare leaſt this preſent calme, doth threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten me with a tempeſt to come. I wyl ſaye, that diſcourteſy in thee, cauſeth doubtfull hope in me. Beholde my miſaduenture, I had loſt a letter, and tourning to the temple to ſeeke it, I founde the letter whiche was of ſome importaunce: and had almoſte loſte my ſelfe, whiche is the greateſt thyng. Conſidering my ſmall rewarde, I ſee my eyes (the ladders of my hope) ſet on ſo high a wal, that no leſſe certaine is my fal, then my climming was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Thou bending downe thy harnes of thy high deſertes, and putting me to the point of continuall ſeruice, ſuffreſt me to enioye the fruite, and geue to whom thou wilt the leaues. By the immortal gods I ſweare, that I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile not a litle, for I thought that in the temple of the virgin Veſtalles no temptation could haue come to man. But nowe by experience I finde, that that woman is eaſelier ouercome, whiche is moſte watched: then the other that hath honeſt libertie. All bodily diſeaſes be firſt had or they be knowen, and knowen or they be ſene, and ſene or they be felte, and felte or they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted: and ſo in all thinges except this darte of loue whom they firſte feale the ſtroke thereof, before they knowe the waye howe it commeth. The light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning commeth not ſo ſodaine, but it is knowen before by the thonder. The wal falleth not ſodeinly, but firſt ſome ſtones fall downe. The colde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not ſo faſte, but ſome ſmall ſhiuering is ſene before: onely loue is not felt, vntil he hath had power in the entrailes. Let them know that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt, &amp; thou lady <hi>Liuia</hi> if thou wilt know. Loue ſleapeth when we wake, &amp; waketh when we ſlepe, laugheth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we weape, &amp; wepeth whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we laugh. It aſſureth in taking, &amp; taketh in aſſuring: it ſpeaketh when we be ſtill, &amp; is ſtil when we ſpeake. And finally it hath ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, that to geue vs our deſire, it cauſeth vs to liue in paine. I ſweare vnto the, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my wil became thy ſeruaunt, &amp; thy beautie made the my miſtres, when I was at the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, and there found thee, neither y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> in thy praier didſt mynde me, nor I vnhappy man did thinke on thee. O vnhappy hart of mine, that being whole thou art deuided, being in health thou art hurt, being aliue thou art killed, being mine thou art ſtolen, &amp; the worſt of al is, that thou not helping to my lyfe, conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that death ſhal aſſault me. Conſidering many times lady <hi>Liuia</hi> with my ſelfe my thoughtes to be high, &amp; my fortunes baſe, I would haue ſeperated my ſelfe from thee: but knowing my trauaile to be wel emploied in thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, I ſay though I might, I would not be ſeperated from thee. I wil not
<pb facs="tcp:21411:380"/>
deny one thing, that is: the curſed loue taketh away the taſt of al thinges, &amp; in thoſe things only it geueth vs pleaſure, which are greatly againſt our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. This is the profe of him that loueth hartely, that one frowne of her that he loueth, doth more greue him, then al the delightes of the reſt of his life ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pleaſe. I deme lady <hi>Lyuia,</hi> thou arte abaſhed to ſe me openly as a philopher, &amp; to know me ſecretly as a louer. I beſech thee hartely diſcouer me not. For if the gods graunt me long life, I am now a young foole, yet in age I will be wyſe. The gods know what I deſire, and the force whiche doth enforce me thereunto. And as the fleſhe is weake, &amp; the hart tender, the occaſions many, the vertues fewe, the world deceitfull, the people malicious: ſo I paſſe this ſpringe time with floures, in hope that in harueſt I ſhall haue ſome fruite. Thinkeſt thou lady <hi>Liuia,</hi> that philoſophers be thei neuer ſo wiſe, are not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the ſharp dartes of loue? and that vnder their courſe clothes, there is not ſoft fleſhe &amp; white? Certainly amonges hard bones, is nouriſhed ſofte fleſhe: &amp; within the pricking huſkes, growe the cheſſe nut. I ſaye, that vnder ſimple attire, is the faithful loue. I doe not deny but our fraile nature doeth withſtande our vertues. Nor I deny not but that the wanton deſires, are repreſſed with vertuous mindes. Nor I deny not but that the raſhenes of youth are reſtrained with the reynes of reaſon. I deny not but many times wiſedome doth withſtand that that the fleſhe procureth: &amp; yet I confeſſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he that is not amorous, is a foole. And doſt not thou know, although we be wiſe, we leaue not therfore to be men? doſt not thou know, all that euer we learne in our life, ſuffiſeth not to gouerne the fleſhe one houre? doeſt not thou know, that to wiſe men in this caſe hath fallen many errours? doſt not thou know that there hath bene, &amp; are many maiſters of vertues: and much more there are &amp; hath bene folowers of vices? then why doeſt thou make ſuche a wonder only of me? I wil not ſaye it without a trouth, that I neuer had my iudgement ſo good &amp; perfite, as when <hi>Cupide</hi> blewe winde on me with his winges. There was neuer man vntil my time accompted wiſe, but firſt he was entangled with <hi>Cupides</hi> ſnares. <hi>Gratian</hi> was in loue with <hi>Tamira, Solon Salaminus,</hi> the geuer of the lawes, was enamored with one Gretian. <hi>Pittacus Mitelenus</hi> left his owne wife, &amp; was in loue with a bond woman y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he brought from the warre. <hi>Cleobulus</hi> when he was .lxxx. yere olde, &amp; had red philoſophy lxv. yeres, climming vp a ladder to ſcale his neighbours houſe, fel, and of the bruſe died. <hi>Periander</hi> prince of <hi>Achaia,</hi> &amp; chefe philoſopher of Grece, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of his louers, ſlew his owne wife. <hi>Anacharſis</hi> a Philoſopher, a <hi>Sithian</hi> by his father, and a Greeke by the mother ſide, loued ſo dearely a woman of <hi>Thebes,</hi> that he taught her al that he knew: in ſo much that he being ſicke on his bed, ſhe red for him in the ſcholes <hi>Epimenides</hi> of <hi>Crete,</hi> that ſlept .xv. yeares without waking, Although he was agreat worſhipper of the Gods, yet was he banniſhed <hi>Athens</hi> .x. yeres for the louing of women. <hi>Architus Tarentinus,</hi> the maiſter of <hi>Plato,</hi> &amp; ſcholer of <hi>Pithagoras,</hi> occupied his mynd more to inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t new kinds of loue, then to employ his minde to vertues &amp; learning. <hi>Gorgias Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> borne in <hi>Scycil,</hi> had mo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cubines in his houſe, then bookes in his ſtudy. Al theſe were wiſe men, &amp; we knew them wiſe, yet at thend they were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the fleſh. Therfore blame me not alone, for as I haue told thee of theſe few, ſo could I of a whole army. For of trouth he ought to haue many thinges, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wilbe acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted a curious louer. He muſt haue his eyes diſplayed
<pb facs="tcp:21411:381"/>
on her that he loueth, his vnderſtanding much altered in that he thinketh, his tongue troubled in that he ſhould ſpeake: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in ſeing he be blind, in thinking diſmaid, in ſpeaking troubled. O lady <hi>Liuia,</hi> the louing in mockery, paſſeth by mockery: but wheras true loue is, there is grefe &amp; no mockerie: there loue ſpitteth his poiſon, &amp; cruel <hi>Cupide</hi> fixeth his arrowes vp to the feathers. The eies wepe, the harte ſigheth, the fleſhe trembleth, the ſenewes doe ſhrinke, the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is groſſe, reaſon faileth, &amp; ſo al falleth to the earth. Finally the heauy louer abyding in himſelfe, holdeth nothing of himſelfe. Al this I ſaye, becauſe if I want knowledge to make me a louer, yet am I ſure that the workes faile not in me to worke thy ſeruice. And though by miſhap I ſawe the, yet by good chaunce I knew thee. I aſke nothing of thee but that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> loue me faithfully, ſith I loue the vnfainedly. And if thou heareſt that I am ſicke from my hart, I deſire the to do me ſome good. Sith it is only in the to help me, it is reaſon thou only do ſeke for remedy. I was greatly comforted whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Fulius Carlinus</hi> deſired me in thy behalfe to doe a pleaſure, which I did incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou deſiredſt, to the intent that thou another day ſhouldeſt doe frankly that I deſire thee. And behold lady <hi>Liuia,</hi> the woman that is ſerued with ſeruices, it is reaſon within a whyle ſhe be ſued vnto by prayer. And though my ſtrength cannot open the gates of the purpoſe, or not agreing to thy demaund, yet al my labours ſlake not to vphold thy renowme. I praye the diſcouer not the one, nor beguile me with the other. For thou ſeeſt in graunting is remedy, and in hoping is comfort. But promiſe is deceiuable, &amp; delayeng is perylous, and the entertaining byndeth. I ſe wel that the harty demaund, requyreth a long aunſwere: but I would not thou ſhouldeſt do ſo. But as I loue the, ſo loue me: as I deſire of the, ſo grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thou me. I will ſay once againe I am all thine, &amp; nothing mine owne. And note lady <hi>Liuia,</hi> that it is as muche honour to thee, as profitable for me, that thou chaunge theſe thy deſires, &amp; put in order thy diſordered will. For thou ſeeſt it is muche better to heale ſhortly, then to late, with failing thy purpoſe. All women ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue one euill opinion, that is: ye neuer receiue councel, although it be geuen you in neuer ſo waighty a caſe. And if it be not ſo, then becauſe thou arte eſtemed beautiful, be likewyſe honoured for taking of good counſel. In this ſorte, though my loſſe be much, &amp; thy pacience litle, yet ſhall they accompt me wiſe in geuing counſel, &amp; the moſt happy to folowe it. One thing I will ſay to thee, &amp; pardon me therin. Women be much defamed in that they wil take no councel, &amp; ſuch as do aſſure their renowme ſo much on the iudgement of others, as they condemne wel doing before. I thinke good if it ſo like thee, &amp; would if thou wilt, that thou ſhould doe in all pointes as I haue counſayled thee. I will ſay no more lady <hi>Liuia,</hi> but that I doe preſent to thee all my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate troubles, my ſighes as a deſperate man, my ſeruice as thy ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t my troubled griefes, my wordes of philoſophy, and my teares as a louer. I ſende thee here a girdle of golde, on condition that thou alwayes fixe thy eies on that, and thy harte on me. I pray the gods geue me to thee, &amp; thee to me.</p>
